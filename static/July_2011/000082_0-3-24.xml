    <summary>The flood control limits have become an issue again, leading to the need for a 0.3.24 release. This release will include sipa's flood limit fix, dnsseed on by default and possibly UPnP enabled by default as well. Matt has set up a DNSSeed that fills its hostname with random nodes known to be up and accepting connections. Since its no longer a static list, he thinks it's time to enable dnsseed by default. Additionally, he believes that UPnP by default would be a good idea as it could increase the number of nodes which accept incoming connections. Jgarzik has also suggested enabling UPnP by default, and Matt doesn't see much reason not to. Finally, there is a commit that needs to be included to fix the no-connections-up segfault.</summary>
