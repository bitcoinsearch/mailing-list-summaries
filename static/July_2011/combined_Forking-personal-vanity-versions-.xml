    <summary>In July 2011, there was a discussion on a Bitcoin forum regarding the existence of multiple vanity versions of Bitcoin. Alan Grimes made a brief comment in response to those who were critical of these versions, but this sparked criticism from another forum user who believed this type of comment was unhelpful and added no value to the discussion. The term "vanity version" refers to a version of Bitcoin that removes the use of libdb or requires users to not have its development headers installed on their system.</summary>
