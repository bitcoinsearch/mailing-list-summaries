    <summary>In July 2011, a discussion about the various versions of Bitcoin was taking place on the forums. Alan Grimes responded to those who believed that there were too many "vanity versions" of Bitcoin with a curt statement: "'nuff said." This provoked a negative response from another forum user who criticized Grimes for not contributing anything useful to the conversation and suggested keeping such comments to oneself. Another user asked if there was a version of Bitcoin that did not require the use of libdb or development headers installed on one's system, referencing a potential "vanity version."</summary>
