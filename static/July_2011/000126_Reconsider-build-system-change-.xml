    <summary>Pieter, a developer of the Bitcoin codebase, responded to John Smith's email regarding the choice of build system for the project. Pieter stated that he has no preference for any particular build system but would prefer a system that is easy to set up and allows building of the codebase on multiple Linux distributions, does cross-compilation to Windows, supports OSX, is easy to maintain, and can be adapted by other GUIs such as bitcoin-qt. He further added that if a system meets all of these requirements and is implemented and tested, he would have no problem choosing it for future versions.</summary>
