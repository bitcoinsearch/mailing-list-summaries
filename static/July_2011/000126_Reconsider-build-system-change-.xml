    <summary>In 2011, a discussion arose on the Bitcoin development mailing list regarding the choice of autotools as the project build system. John Smith questioned why autotools was chosen over cmake for future versions. Pieter, in response, stated that he had no preference for any particular build system as long as it met certain criteria. These criteria included ease of setup, cross-compatibility with various operating systems and GUIs, and ease of maintenance. He further added that if a build system satisfied all of these requirements, he would have no problem choosing it for future versions of Bitcoin.</summary>
