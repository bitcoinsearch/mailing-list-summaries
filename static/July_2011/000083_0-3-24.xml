    <summary>Matt Corallo, a Bitcoin developer, suggests the need for a 0.3.24 release due to flood control limits becoming an issue again. The idea is to have sipa's flood limit fix, which seems to be working fine and has reduced syncing time by 1.5 minutes for the early blocks. The suggestion also includes turning on dnsseed by default, which can support the network by having more listening nodes. Matt estimates that there are around 4000 stable listening nodes, and with linear extrapolation from two-day lfnet growth, they may run out of sockets in a little over a month. Therefore, getting more listening nodes is an urgent matter. Additionally, he suggests updating the checkpoint in 0.3.24 as the difficulty has increased almost 17x since the highest one currently in place, which could lead to parties mining nice forks at 1/16th the current difficulty for nodes that they've sibyled.</summary>
