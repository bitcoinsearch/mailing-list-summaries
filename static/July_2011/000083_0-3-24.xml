    <summary>The email thread from June 30, 2011, discusses the need for a Bitcoin Core release of version 0.3.24 due to flood control limits becoming an issue again. The proposed changes for this release include sipa's flood limit fix, having dnsseed on by default, and maybe UPnP enabled by default as well. One contributor believes that the flood disconnects have been contributing to network partitioning, and increasing the nLimit in sipa's code from 500 to 5000 reduced the syncup time for them by about 1.5 minutes, almost all of the speedup being in the early blocks. The contributor also suggests updating the checkpoint in 0.3.24 since difficulty has increased almost 17x since the highest one currently in there. Another contributor suggests turning on dnsseed, which they have been using for a while, but notes that more dnsseed roots are needed. They estimate that there are around 4000 stable listening nodes and that getting more listening nodes is a somewhat urgent matter as a result. Additionally, the contributors discuss UPnP, noting that linear extrapolation from the two-day lfnet growth leave them running out of sockets in a little more than a month, and suggest that it is not good. They estimate that they need 2189 listening nodes to support the network, but the real distribution will be somewhat uneven due to bad luck and the /16 limit.</summary>
