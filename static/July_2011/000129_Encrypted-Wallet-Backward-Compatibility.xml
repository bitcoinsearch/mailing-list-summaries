    <summary>The current version of Bitcoin has backward-compatibility issues with wallet encryption. In version 0.3.23, Bitcoin dies after writing one unencrypted private key to the encrypted wallet. In version 0.3.22, Bitcoin opens and displays transactions, but shows a total balance of only unencrypted keys and each transaction shows only confirmation count, date, no description, and a debit/credit of 0.00. Suggestions were made to work around this issue, such as renaming wallet.dat for encrypted wallets or doing nothing and letting old clients get mad. However, it is important for Bitcoin to prevent this issue in the future so that it doesn't continue on as if nothing had happened when faced with unknown keys. A pull request was made to address this issue.</summary>
