    <summary>The writer did more research on a data structure in wallet settings that could potentially cause all versions of Bitcoin to crash instead of opening in a new wallet or some other incomplete state. They inserted an empty object in addrIncoming, which they believe will solve the problem and isn't used anywhere else in the code. They provide a link to the commit for others to review and ask if anyone has a different solution. They mention that this solves all known issues and suggestions with newenc except for invalid mlock calculations, which they plan to fix. Finally, they request any remaining suggestions/blockers on newenc and if none exist, they ask for final acknowledgments.</summary>
