    <summary>TheBlueMatt has found a data structure in wallet settings that will cause all versions of Bitcoin to crash on load, which is an improvement from the previous half-state situation. The commit for this can be found at https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/bitcoin/commit/2e8383469d7e12a495b3a1dbd41a8d211ff34fe8. There are no known issues or suggestions on newenc except for invalid mlock calculations, which TheBlueMatt plans to fix. They are seeking final ACKs on the newenc solution.</summary>
