    <summary>A user named John Smith expresses his annoyance with the current state of forums related to Bitcoin. He suggests removing the link to these forums from bitcoin.org and replacing it with a forum that focuses solely on helping users, merchants, and developers of Bitcoin. John believes that official forums for an open-source project should not contain discussions about economic or political futures, philosophical debates, FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) about exchanges or companies, or topics already covered in FAQs. He suggests creating a neutral forum that is similar to the Ubuntu forums. In response to John's suggestion, Matt notes that there are not enough people to moderate such a forum even if they had the power to do so.</summary>
