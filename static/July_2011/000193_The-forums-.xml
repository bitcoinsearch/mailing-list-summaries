    <summary>A member of the bitcoin community expressed annoyance with the current forums and proposed that bitcoin.org replace the link to the forums with a more helpful and neutral forum for users, merchants, and developers. The proposal suggests that the new forum should focus on practical help with bitcoin technology adoption. However, Matt, another member of the community, responded that there are not enough moderators to manage such a forum. The discussion highlights the importance of having a helpful and moderated forum for the growing bitcoin community.</summary>
