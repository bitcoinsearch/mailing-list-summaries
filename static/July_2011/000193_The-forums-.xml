    <summary>In an email thread from 2011, John Smith expressed his annoyance with the forums and suggested removing the link from bitcoin.org and replacing it with a forum solely focused on helping users, merchants, and developers. Smith believed that the official forums of an open source project should be neutral and provide assistance rather than being a platform for political and philosophical debates or spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). However, Matt replied that they don't have enough moderators to manage such a forum effectively. While discussing this issue, the email thread also included a digitally signed message part.</summary>
