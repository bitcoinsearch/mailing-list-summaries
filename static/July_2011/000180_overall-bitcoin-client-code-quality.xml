    <summary>In this email thread, the discussion revolved around improving the Bitcoin codebase. One suggestion was to move towards a 'libbitcoin'. It was proposed to create a branch and start libbtc by implementing a small module like irc or p2p connection handling. The aim was to have a new clean code base without having a non-functional client for some time. Another issue raised was about hardcoded values for the official and the testnet block chain. The suggestion was to move all chain related settings to a chain description file. However, there was no real reason to do this aside from questionable code cleanup, and it could encourage improperly-implemented alternate chains. Finally, there was a comment made that trying to fix bugs on an old codebase while rewriting a new one is worthless and just creating way more effort than is necessary.</summary>
