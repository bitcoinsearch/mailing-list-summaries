    <summary>In an email conversation, Christian Decker suggests that multithreading the RPC and implementing Keep-Alive would speed up services. However, this should be thoroughly tested to ensure it doesn't expose race conditions elsewhere in the code. The idea of a 'hub mode' is criticized as it could lead to more aggressive connecting and consume more resources. Instead, miners should manually addnode each other. The addnode logic should be fixed to reserve connection slots for addnoded nodes and try to keep connecting to them. There is room for longer term improvements to the connection and forwarding logic, but testing and validating changes is difficult.</summary>
