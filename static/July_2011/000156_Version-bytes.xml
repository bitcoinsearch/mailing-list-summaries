    <summary>In an email exchange on July 8th, 2011, Pieter proposed resetting testnet or changing its addresses slightly to differentiate it from realnet. Stefan suggested implementing the XOR hack temporarily and then removing it after resetting testnet. However, Pieter believed that breaking compatibility with older addresses, even on testnet, was not a good idea at the moment as it's important to maintain stability and backward compatibility. They ultimately decided to use the XOR 111 hack to visually differentiate testnet codes from realnet ones. Additionally, Pieter noted that a modification to nVersion of less than 5 in absolute value could cause the first base58 character to remain equal.</summary>
