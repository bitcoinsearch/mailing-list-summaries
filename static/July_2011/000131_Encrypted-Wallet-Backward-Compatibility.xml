    <summary>In this communication, Gavin Andresen discusses the issue of unencrypted keys and a potential attack on the keypool. He points out that simply loading the keys without adding them to mapAddressBook or setKeyPool will not allow for new transactions but still enables the user to receive bitcoins. He also addresses the issue of breaking backup scripts when using the backupwallet command, as it will fail to encrypt wallet.dat if renamed to wallet_e.dat. One proposed solution is to truncate wallet.dat, create an encrypted wallet called wallet_e.dat, and set file-permissions to 000. This may work for Linux and Mac, but could cause errors on Windows load and other unforeseeable issues for odd scripts. Lastly, the idea of future-proofing wallet.dat is discussed, with the suggestion of adding nMinVersion to specify the minimum version needed to read the file in order to avoid incompatible changes and possible wallet corruption. Overall, the conversation is focused on addressing potential security issues and improving the functionality of the Bitcoin wallet.</summary>
