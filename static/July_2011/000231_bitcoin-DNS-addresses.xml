    <summary>In this email conversation, Rick Wesson and Matt discuss the use of DNS and HTTPS for resolving bitcoin addresses. Rick argues that DNS resolution is not a good idea due to potential MITM attacks and that DNSSEC is not a reliable security measure in this case. Matt agrees with this point and states that he prefers using HTTPS because it allows for giving different addresses to each client based on IP more easily. He acknowledges that the advantages of HTTPS in this context are small but still prefers it over DNS. He also mentions that there are many HTTPS libraries available with thorough security audits, while DNSSEC-implementing DNS recursion libraries may not be as reliable.</summary>
