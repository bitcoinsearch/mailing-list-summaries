    <summary>In an email thread dated July 1st, 2011, Gavin Andresen discussed several topics related to Bitcoin development. He suggested turning on DNS seed and block sending while fixing a segfault bug. Regarding UPnP, he proposed enabling it on Windows/Mac but keeping it off-by-default on Linux. Andresen also expressed uncertainty about OS differentiation in this regard, suggesting that it might be better to disable UPnP by default on bitcoind but keep it on by default on Bitcoin. Finally, he recommended adding another block-chain checkpoint as a good idea.</summary>
