    <summary>In an email conversation dated July 1, 2011, Gavin Andresen discussed various topics related to the Bitcoin software. He agreed to turn on DNS seed and fix a segfault bug. In regards to UPnP, Andresen suggested enabling it on Windows and Mac but keeping it off by default on Linux, although he was unsure about differentiating between operating systems. Lastly, Andresen proposed adding another block-chain checkpoint to the software. The email includes a digitally signed message part as an attachment.</summary>
