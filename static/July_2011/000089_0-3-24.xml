    <summary>In an email thread on July 1st, 2011, Gavin Andresen discussed various topics related to Bitcoin development. He agreed to turn on the DNS seed and block send functions while fixing a segfault bug. Regarding the UPnP feature, he suggested enabling it on Windows and Mac but keeping it off-by-default on Linux. There was some uncertainty about whether the feature should be differentiated by operating system or not. Andresen also recommended adding another block-chain checkpoint for improved security. The email included a digitally signed message attachment.</summary>
