    <summary>In a message dated July 3, 2011, Pieter Wuille expressed that he had no preference for any particular project build system for bitcoin. He listed several criteria for the ideal system, including ease of setup, ability to build the codebase on multiple Linux distributions, cross-compilation to Windows, support for OSX, ease of maintenance, and adaptability to other GUIs such as bitcoin-qt. He expressed willingness to choose a system that met these criteria. Wuille also asked for opinions from others interested in writing a CMake configuration for bitcoin.</summary>
