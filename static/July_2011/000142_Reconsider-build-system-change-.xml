    <summary>Pieter Wuille is looking for a project build system that meets certain criteria for future versions of Bitcoin. The ideal system would be easy to set up, allow building of the Bitcoin codebase on multiple Linux distros, support cross-compilation to Windows, and be compatible with OSX. It should also be easy to maintain and adaptable to other GUIs such as bitcoin-qt. Pieter is open to suggestions and asks if anyone is interested in writing a cmake configuration for Bitcoin.</summary>
