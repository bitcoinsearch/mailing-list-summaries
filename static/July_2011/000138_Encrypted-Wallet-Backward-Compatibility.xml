    <summary>In an email thread on July 4th, 2011, Gavin Andresen expressed his opinion that the fixes proposed for version 0.3.24 of an unspecified software were not necessary. He argued that fixing downgrade-to-0.3.24 was low priority because downgrade-to-something-before-0.3.24 was equally likely and would do something mostly reasonable. There was a brief exchange of messages with someone who disagreed before they ultimately settled on using version 0.3.24. The email included a non-text attachment called signature.asc, which was described as a digitally signed message part.</summary>
