    <summary>In an email conversation, Gavin Andresen expressed his opinion that neither of the two pulls were necessary for version 0.3.24. He also mentioned that fixing downgrade-to-0.3.24 was not a high priority since there was a possibility of downgrading to something before that version which would still do something reasonable. However, the other person disagreed with Gavin's opinion but eventually agreed to use version 0.3.24. The email included a digitally signed message attachment.</summary>
