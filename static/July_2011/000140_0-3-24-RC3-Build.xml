    <summary>The 0.3.24 RC3 tar has been uploaded to a Dropbox link, which is shared in the given context. The SHA1 of the file is also provided. The author disagrees with the idea that version 0.3.24 should not handle incompatible wallets cleanly. Additionally, there is a note regarding a broken gitian-win32.yml and instructions on how to fix it by removing specific lines. The author signs off by reminding readers to build gitian signed and email signed as always.</summary>
