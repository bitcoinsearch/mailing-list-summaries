    <summary>Bitcoin 0.3.24 RC3 tar has been uploaded to http://dl.dropbox.com/u/29653426/Bitcoin%200.3.24%20RC3.tar.bz2. The SHA1 for the same is af85f46201bfffaf38fe4d64f3aa357ac03b51e1. However, there seems to be a disagreement regarding the fact that 0.3.24 should handle incompatible wallets cleanly. It has been noted that gitian-win32.yml is broken and lines need to be removed in order to fix it. The copy command 'cp WSPiApi.h $HOME/build' needs to be removed from the script. The build needs to be gitian signed and email signed as always. The message has been signed using a digital signature.</summary>
