    <summary>The discussion between Rick Wesson and Matt is about the security implications of using DNSSEC for Bitcoin address communication. Matt believes that implementing a full DNS resolver with root trust anchors and knowledge of root servers in Bitcoin is not secure against a coffee-shop network MITMer. He thinks that HTTPS is a better solution without any significant drawbacks. Rick agrees that DNS-based resolving is not a good idea and suggests moving the thread to a more appropriate forum for discussing how applications leverage DNS security extensions. He also expresses his interest in working on the issues surrounding usability and simplifying user experience. The conversation also touches on the topic of self-signed certificates and their vulnerability to attacks. It is mentioned that Windows, Unix variants, Mac OSX, and Android support DNSSEC.</summary>
