    <summary>In an email exchange between Douglas Huff and Gavin Andresen, they discuss breaking backup scripts that use the backupwallet RPC command. Gavin suggests that these scripts will continue to work, but Douglas argues that it's actually desirable to break unsafe or poorly designed backup mechanisms with the upcoming import/export merge. However, he clarifies that silently breaking them is not ideal, as users may not notice that they are backing up a zero byte file.</summary>
