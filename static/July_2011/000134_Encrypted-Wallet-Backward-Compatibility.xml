    <summary>In an email exchange between Douglas Huff and Gavin Andresen on July 4, 2011, they discuss the potential for backup scripts to be broken in light of upcoming changes to import/export functions. Andresen suggests that backup scripts using the backupwallet RPC command will continue to work, but Huff goes further, stating that intentionally breaking unsafe or badly designed backup mechanisms is desirable given the planned merge with import/export. However, he notes that silently breaking them would not be ideal, as users may not immediately notice that their backups are now zero byte files.</summary>
