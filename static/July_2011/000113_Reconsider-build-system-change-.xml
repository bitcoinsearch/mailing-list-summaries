    <summary>The email thread discusses the possibility of using CMake instead of Autotools as the future build system for Bitcoin. Some advantages of CMake over Autotools include its ability to generate native build scripts for Make, XCode, and Visual Studio, clearer syntax, faster performance, and better support in tools like Qt Creator. However, one contributor notes that Autotools is more standard than CMake and doesn't require an additional installation. The discussion also mentions a CMake build system already integrated into rpcminer and the fact that CMake supports cross-compiling. Overall, there was no conscious decision made to switch from Autotools to CMake, and any potential change would depend on whoever writes the new build system.</summary>
