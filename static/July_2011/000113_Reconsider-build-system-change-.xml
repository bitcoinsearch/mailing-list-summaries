    <summary>The discussion on whether to merge autotools or cmake for bitcoin's future build system took place in 2011 via the Bitcoin-development mailing list. John Smith argued in favor of cmake, citing its ability to generate native build scripts for all platforms, clearer syntax, fast speed, and support from various open source applications such as Qt Creator. However, Matt pointed out that no conscious decision was made, and whoever writes the build system would be responsible for choosing between autotools and cmake. He also noted that autotools needs to be redone before it is merged. Furthermore, autotools is considered more standard than CMake, and does not require installation since it is a shell script. John Smith added that CMake supports cross-compiling and that there is already a CMake build system for bitcoin integrated into rpcminer. Overall, the discussion highlighted the pros and cons of both options but did not lead to a definitive decision.</summary>
