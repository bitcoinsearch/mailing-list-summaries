    <summary>Pull 349 implements an implementation of multiple signature escrowed transactions, which is a necessary addition to the client following the disappearance of clearcoin. The patch has been tested on a private network and appears to work well. However, it requires a new transaction type and more testing and discussion before it can be added to the client. Additionally, the patch exposes an issue with multisig validation due to redundancy in the script length coding opcodes, which means that it's possible to code a script multiple ways. One candidate fix for this issue is to exclude the length opcodes from the comparison, but this carries a risk of creating differences in how nodes validate transactions leading to lasting forks. Another potential solution would be to define that OP_PUSHDATA* cannot be used to push smaller lengths, which could be more efficiently encoded with direct length opcodes. Lastly, changing out the templating code to ensure that it codes the template the same way as the original was coded is another way of fixing this problem, but it seems tricky to implement and validate.</summary>
