    <summary>The conversation revolves around whether to use autotools or CMake as the build system for bitcoin. It is noted that an autotools patch was submitted, leading to discussion about merging autotools. However, it is mentioned that the autotools need to be redone before they can be merged with the project. The advantages of CMake over autotools are also discussed, including its support for cross-compiling and clearer syntax. Moreover, CMake is faster and more standard than autotools. Despite this, it is pointed out that CMake does not come standard on many distributions, while autotools is a shell script and therefore does not require installation. Pieter Wuille notes that he has no preference for either system but specifies certain criteria that any chosen system must meet.</summary>
