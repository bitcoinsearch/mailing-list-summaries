    <summary>The discussion on choosing a build system for future versions of bitcoin was brought up by John Smith who questioned why autotools was chosen over CMake, stating that CMake is more standard and has clearer syntax. Another user, Pieter Wuille, expressed that he had no preference for any particular build system and would be open to using a system that is easy to set up, allows for building on multiple platforms, supports cross-compilation, is easy to maintain, can be adapted to other GUIs, and can be tested to support all of the above. It was noted that autotools supports cross compiling, but it needs to be redone before it would be merged. While CMake is faster and has some advantages over autotools, it does not come standard on many distributions. A CMake build system for bitcoin is already available in rpcminer.</summary>
