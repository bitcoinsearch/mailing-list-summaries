    <summary>In a message posted on July 1, 2011, Pieter Wuille proposed a 0.3.24 release of Bitcoin to address issues with flood control limits and other improvements. The release would include features like dnsseed and UPnP enabled by default and a block send limit. Matt Corallo confirmed the need for this release and suggested including sipa's flood limit fix and the commit to fix the no-connections-up segfault. DNS seed is a program that allows nodes to discover each other without relying on IRC. Pieter Wuille had set up a DNSSeed with reliable hosting which dynamically fills its hostname with random nodes known to be up and accepting connections. He also suggested enabling UPnP by default as it could increase the percentage of nodes that accept incoming connections.</summary>
