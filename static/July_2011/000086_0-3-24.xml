    <summary>The Bitcoin community is discussing the need for a 0.3.24 release due to flood control limits becoming an issue again. The proposed release would include sipa's flood limit fix and dnsseed on by default, as well as UPnP enabled by default. Matt Corallo has set up a DNSSeed with reliable hosting that dynamically fills its hostname with random nodes known to be up and accepting connections. However, multiple people running such a seed would be ideal to prevent problems with occasional outages of DNS seeds. Since it is no longer a static list, enabling DNS seed by default is suggested. UPnP by default is also a good idea to increase the percentage of nodes that accept incoming connections. The release should also include a block send limit and a bugfix for the no-connections-up segfault.</summary>
