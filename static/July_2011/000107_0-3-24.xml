    <summary>In a discussion thread dated July 1, 2011, Matt Corallo shared his thoughts on the development of CWallet in version 0.3.24 of Bitcoin software. While some members of the team were in favor of cherry-picking, Corallo suggested that a broad-based test of CWallet would be beneficial for finding potential bugs before moving on to version 0.4. He also emphasized that this was only a minor update release, and that the team should focus on completing it quickly to avoid interruptions in the development of version 0.4. Corallo expressed relief that this release would be an -rc before full release, which alleviated some of his concerns. He further mentioned that he had already conducted a significant amount of semi-automated testing of cwallet+crypto, both encrypted and unencrypted, and did not want to repeat that testing solely for cwallet.</summary>
