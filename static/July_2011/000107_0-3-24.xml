    <summary>In a discussion between Matt Corallo, sipa, and gmaxwell on July 1st, 2011, they were debating whether to use cherry-pick or do a broad-based test of CWallet in version 0.3.24. While sipa and gmaxwell preferred cherry-picking, Matt suggested doing a test to find potential bugs before the release of crypto and version 0.4. However, he also noted that they shouldn't spend too much time on this minor update release and should focus on version 0.4 without interruption. The fact that it will be an -rc (release candidate) before the full release softens his concern. Matt had already done semi-automated testing of cwallet+crypto in both encrypted and non-encrypted states, which he didn't want to redo for cwallet alone.</summary>
