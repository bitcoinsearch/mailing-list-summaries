    <summary>In a discussion about the release of version 0.3.24 of CWallet, there were differing opinions on whether to use cherry-pick or conduct a broad-base test. However, it was agreed that testing should be done to identify potential bugs before the release of crypto and version 0.4. The release of an rc version before the full release helped to soften concerns. One member had already conducted a lot of semi-automated testing on cwallet+crypto and did not want to repeat the process for cwallet alone. It was also noted that this is only a minor update release and should not take up too much time.</summary>
