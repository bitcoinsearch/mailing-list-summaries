    <summary>In a Bitcoin-development mailing list, Luke-Jr shared his thoughts on different patches and updates for Bitcoin. He provided various links to different versions of Bitcoin and suggested which ones should be merged. Among the most notable features are HTTP/1.1 keep-alive support and coinbaser, which popens a given command and reads coinbase outputs from stdout. However, some features that Luke-Jr suggested, such as eligius_relay and eligius_sendfee, were rejected due to concerns about DDoS attacks. Additionally, he suggested cleaning up the codebase before adding more minority features. Lastly, he added a link to access all the available versions from git.</summary>
