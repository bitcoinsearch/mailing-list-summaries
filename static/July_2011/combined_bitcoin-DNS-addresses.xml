    <summary>In a series of email exchanges, the discussion revolves around the use of DNSSEC and HTTPS for resolving Bitcoin addresses. A user suggests using DNS to facilitate sending of coin, by publishing a TXT record in the DNS with their wallet address. However, another user counters this argument stating that despite DNSSec being out there, DNS is still insecure for transmitting something that will result in money transfer, and that it is not well-suited for this kind of thing. Instead, he suggests using URIs or an HTTPS server for better name-to-address mapping. The advantages of HTTPS over a DNSSEC-based solution are also highlighted. The discussion touches upon issues surrounding usability and user experience, and how remembering and communicating a Bitcoin address are current limiting factors in the acceptance and deployment of the software.</summary>
