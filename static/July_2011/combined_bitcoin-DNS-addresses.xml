    <summary>Rick Wesson joined a mailing list with the aim of producing a patch to support DNS lookups for sending Bitcoin. However, Matt thinks that using URIs is a simpler and more useful method than DNS. Matt argues that although DNSSec is available, DNS is still very insecure, making it unsuitable for transmitting something that results in money transfer. Matt suggests using an HTTPS server with addresses instead. Rick suggested that DNS mapping could make DNSSEC more popular, but Matt thinks that this would not happen because Bitcoin is still tiny. Matt argues that HTTPS has advantages over DNSSEC-based solutions without any significant drawbacks he can see. HTTPS makes giving different addresses to each client based on IP much easier. DNS resolution of Bitcoin addresses is bad because of potential MITM attacks. DNSSEC is not a security measure for mitigating DNS resolution of Bitcoin addresses because the application would require its own DNSSEC enabled stub resolver. HTTPS mapping offers some advantages such as ease of offering up different addresses to different people by IP address.</summary>
