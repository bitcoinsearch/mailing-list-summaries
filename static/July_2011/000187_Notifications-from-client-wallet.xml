    <summary>In a message to the Bitcoin development mailing list in 2011, John Smith suggested using boost::signal to add notifications to the client and wallet. This mechanism would allow for decoupled delivery of 'signals' from an object to multiple other objects without the emitting object having to care. Smith proposed specific notifications for the Wallet including balanceChanged, transactionAdded, transactionUpdated, transactionRemoved, addressAdded, addressUpdated, addressRemoved, notification, and askFee. For the Network client, he suggested numConnectionsChanged, numBlocksChanged, and notification. Pieter, another member of the mailing list, expressed approval of this idea and offered some additional suggestions for implementation.</summary>
