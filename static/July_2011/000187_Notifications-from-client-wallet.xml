    <summary>In an email exchange, John Smith proposes to add notifications to the client and wallet so that UIs no longer have to poll for changes. He suggests using the boost::signal mechanism, which allows decoupled delivery of 'signals' from an object, enabling multiple other objects to listen in on an event without the emitting object having to care. Specific notifications that would be useful are listed for the Wallet and Network client. For the Wallet, these include balanceChanged, transactionAdded, transactionUpdated, transactionRemoved, addressAdded, addressUpdated, addressRemoved, notification, and askFee. For the Network client, they include numConnectionsChanged, numBlocksChanged, and notification. Some further discussion takes place regarding certain notifications, such as GetTransactionState() and GetBroadcasts(), which could cause a transactionUpdated event.</summary>
