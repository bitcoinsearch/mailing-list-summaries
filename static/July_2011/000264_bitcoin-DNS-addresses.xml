    <summary>In an email thread from 2011, Rick Wesson asked if anyone had offered to write an easy button for resolving https addresses in Bitcoin. However, it was pointed out that the task had already been completed twice before. No further details or links were provided in the email. The message also contained a digital signature as an attachment.</summary>
