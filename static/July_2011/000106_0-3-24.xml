    <summary>The discussion on whether to release a cherry-picked version or the current upstream version of CWallet in 0.3.24 for Bitcoin is ongoing among developers, with some preferring a broad-based test while others suggest a cherry-pick release with a fix from pull #358. However, there are concerns that cherry-picking may result in zero testing and create a dead-end branch, while a broad-based test could help uncover potential bugs before the release of crypto and 0.4. Ultimately, it is up to the community and Holy Alpaca to make the decision.</summary>
