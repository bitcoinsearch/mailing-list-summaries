    <summary>In an email thread, Rick Wesson suggests that offering a bounty for finding the right technical lead would be more beneficial than offering a bounty for bugs. He believes that if the software works better with fewer bugs, then Bitcoin will become more valuable.

Despite this, Wesson agrees that Gavin should still be paid for his work.</summary>
