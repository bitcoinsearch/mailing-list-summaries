    <summary>In July 2011, Gavin Andresen discussed a new feature in version 0.4 of Bitcoin's software that allows for wallet encryption and the creation of an encrypted wallet file. To ensure the security of the encrypted wallet, the original wallet.dat file is truncated and its file permissions are set to 000. This prevents any old versions of Bitcoin or poorly designed wallet backup scripts from being able to read the unencrypted keying material. Gavin suggested that rewriting the old wallet file before replacing it with a placeholder could further increase security by reducing the chances of the unencrypted keying material being left on disk.</summary>
