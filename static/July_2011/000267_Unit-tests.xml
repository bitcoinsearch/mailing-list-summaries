    <summary>In an email thread dated July 31, 2011, John Smith pointed out that the unit test framework did not build by default. He provided a solution to fix it, suggesting two ways to resolve the issue. The first method was to add "#define BOOST_TEST_DYN_LINK" to the top of test_bitcoin.cpp for dynamic linking. The second option was to link boost_unit_test_framework statically. The latter required a switch to dynamic at the end to avoid an error resulting from static linking with libgcc. Matt referred to pull requests 363 and 442 related to this issue.</summary>
