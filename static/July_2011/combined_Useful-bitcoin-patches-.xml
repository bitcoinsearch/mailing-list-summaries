    <summary>The Bitcoin community is discussing several features that could be added to the network. Multithreading the RPC and adding Keep-Alive support are considered beneficial for everyone. However, Native Long Polling Support and Hub Mode are not favored by some developers due to their potential negative impact on the network. A fix from Luke Dash Jr. has been suggested and is stable according to gmaxwell. Additionally, there is a need for RPC Turbocharge and Resource Leak Fix. There are also other branches available for merging, including coinbaser, gitignore, minfee_modes, eligius_relay, eligius_sendfee, txinfo, and bitcoinuri. The hub mode feature is not recommended due to its potential to cause harm to the network and consume more resources. Instead, miners should manually addnode each other, and the addnode logic should reserve connection slots for such nodes. Lowering fees is not a solution to the problem of "throwing random crap in the chain," and a carefully thought-out and implemented solution needs to be found.</summary>
