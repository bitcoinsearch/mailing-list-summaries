    <summary>There have been discussions regarding several Bitcoin features on the development mailing list, including native long polling support, a fix from Luke Dash Jr., Hub Mode, RPC Turbocharge, and Resource Leak Fix. Christian Decker suggests that multithreading the RPC will speed up many services and there's no downside to it. However, he is against including long polling support because very few people will benefit from it and yet it is included for everyone. The Hub mode generates a ton of net usage on other listening nodes, which is not good. Jeff Garzik posted a link to a file with several useful features that big pools have been requesting, including HTTP/1.1 keep-alive support. Luke-Jr has created branches for each logical part, including hub_mode, threaded_rpc, rpc_keepalive, bugfix_CreateThread_leak, and getwork_dedupe. However, some of these features are seen as useless feature creep by others. The discussion also includes concerns about the connection logic for all nodes and how to solve the problem of people throwing random data in the chain without causing too many side effects.</summary>
