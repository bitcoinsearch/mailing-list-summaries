    <summary>The context is about implementing a source cleanup for Bitcoin. The idea is to have a central notification interface where wallet, net, and block store can communicate with. This will enable separation of pieces and large-scale rewrites of one part without touching other parts. A proposed mechanism for this is using boost::signal, which is a callback system that allows decoupled delivery of signals from an object. Wallet and net should use this interface to communicate with GUI/RPC. Specific notifications that would be useful include balanceChanged, transactionAdded/Updated/Removed, addressAdded/Updated/Removed, notification, and askFee for wallet, and numConnectionsChanged, numBlocksChanged, notification for the network client.</summary>
