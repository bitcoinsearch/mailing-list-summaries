    <summary>In a discussion thread, John Smith proposed to add notifications to the Bitcoin client and wallet using the boost::signal mechanism. The idea is to decouple UI and core communication, so UIs no longer have to poll for changes. Wallet will have various notification signals like balanceChanged, transactionAdded, transactionUpdated, transactionRemoved, addressAdded, addressUpdated, addressRemoved, and notification. Similarly, network client notification signals include numConnectionsChanged, numBlocksChanged, and notification. This should allow for very clean separation of pieces and large-scale rewrites of one or another part without touching anything but the parts that are being redone. Finally, this should also allow for cool programs to use Bitcoin as a library fairly efficiently.</summary>
