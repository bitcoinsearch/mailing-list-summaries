    <summary>The discussion is about UPnP and whether it should be turned on or off by default in the Bitcoin software. Some argue that it is bad for individuals as it increases bandwidth usage, while others believe it is good for the network. A poll shows that there is a 50/50 split between those who want it on and those who want it off. However, one person argues that this should not even be put to a vote and that turning it on is necessary for network stability over the next 90 days. The default only applies to pre-built binaries, so those running bitcoind can continue building without UPNP support. Additionally, it is noted that bitcoind is prebuilt in the daemon folder on the download archives, although it is unclear if this is true for OSX.</summary>
