    <summary>In a discussion thread on Bitcoin development, Luke-Jr expressed concern that some developers are forcing users to pay higher fees than necessary. Matt Corallo argued that the current temporary solution was created to prevent people from adding random transactions to the chain for no reason, and that an actual solution needs to be carefully thought out and implemented. Luke-Jr countered that users are already accepting lower fees and that developers should not get in the way of their transactions. The conversation ended with Luke-Jr urging Corallo to re-read his message and continue the discussion on-list.</summary>
