    <summary>In a discussion between Luke-Jr and Matt Corallo, Luke-Jr expresses concern that users may feel forced to pay more than they have to due to the way software developers are controlling user transactions. Matt Corallo argues that there needs to be a solution to the problem of random transactions being added to the blockchain without causing too many side effects, and simply lowering fees is not the answer. Luke-Jr reiterates that lower fees are already being accepted by users and that developers should not get in the way of users and pools willing to do business.</summary>
