    <summary>In this email exchange between Luke-Jr and Matt Corallo, they discuss the issue of controlling fees in Bitcoin transactions. Luke-Jr argues that developers should not get in the way of users who want to pay lower fees, while Corallo argues that a more comprehensive solution is needed to address the problem of spam transactions. Both parties agree that the current temporary solution is not ideal and needs to be replaced with a more carefully thought-out approach. The email ends with Luke-Jr being urged to reply on-list rather than off-list.</summary>
