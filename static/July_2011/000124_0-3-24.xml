    <summary>The Bitcoin 0.3.24 RC1 builds are available at http://dl.dropbox.com/u/29653426/Bitcoin%200.3.24%20RC1.tar.bz2 and have been gitian signed and email signed as always. However, there are a couple of things that need to be fixed up before release regarding build engineering. The first issue is related to Win98 and spinning up a VM to test any results, which can be found at http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=24841.0. Additionally, the build needs to be done on Ubuntu 8.04 instead of 10.04 so that other libcs can work and do thorough testing of that resulting binary on newer libcs specifically openSUSE 11.04, detailed at http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=21767.0. Matt apologizes for holding up the release due to this issue that remains unfixed after 0.3.21. On the other hand, Jeff Garzik has tagged v0.3.24rc1.</summary>
