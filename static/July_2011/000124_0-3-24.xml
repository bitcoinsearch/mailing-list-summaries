    <summary>The Bitcoin 0.3.24 RC1 builds are now available on Dropbox. The builds have been Gitian signed and email signed, as always. However, there are still some issues with build engineering that need to be fixed before the release. According to a forum post, a copy of Win98 needs to be found and spun up on a virtual machine to test any results from the Windows build. Additionally, developers are advised to build on Ubuntu 8.04 instead of 10.04 so that older libraries can work and to do thorough testing of the resulting binary on newer libraries, specifically openSUSE 11.04. Despite these setbacks, Jeff Garzik has tagged v0.3.24rc1, and Gavin Andresen believes they should move forward with Git tip and fixing bugs in current tip.</summary>
