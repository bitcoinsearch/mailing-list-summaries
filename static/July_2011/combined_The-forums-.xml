    <summary>The forums linked to bitcoin.org are causing frustration amongst users due to speculation, philosophical debates and repeated discussions. John Smith suggests replacing the link with a neutral forum that solely focuses on helping users, merchants and developers of Bitcoin. However, Matt states that there aren't enough people who could moderate such a forum. The discussion then turns to moving the official forum to a new URL due to the illegal content and bad reputation it is giving Bitcoin. Robert McKay suggests the development project should move to a new URL instead, but Matt believes that marking the forums as unofficial and not part of Bitcoin proper would be the best solution.</summary>
