    <summary>A member of the Bitcoin forum expressed annoyance at the forums and requested that they be removed from the official Bitcoin website and replaced with a more user-friendly forum. The member suggested that the new forum should only provide assistance to users, merchants, and developers and avoid discussions on speculation, politics, or philosophy. Another member suggested removing the forum's DNS entry to prevent any legal issues from arising due to illegal activity occurring on the forums. However, it was mentioned that the development project may need to move to a new URL if the forums continue to give Bitcoin a bad name. Overall, the suggestion was made that the forums should be marked as unofficial and not part of Bitcoin proper.</summary>
