    <summary>Members of the Bitcoin community have expressed their frustration with the current forums and are calling for a change. Some believe that the forums are giving Bitcoin a bad reputation due to the illegal activities and discussions taking place there. John Smith suggests replacing the link to the forums on bitcoin.org with a forum solely focused on helping users, merchants, and developers without any discussions about speculation or political futures. However, Matt explains that they do not have enough people with moding power to manage such a forum effectively. Robert McKay even suggests that the development project should move to a new URL, but this idea is not widely supported. The discussion ultimately revolves around the need for a more helpful and constructive forum experience for Bitcoin users.</summary>
