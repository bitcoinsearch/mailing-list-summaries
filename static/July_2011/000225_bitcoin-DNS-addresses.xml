    <summary>In an email conversation, Rick Wesson suggests that using email addresses instead of bitcoin addresses would be more convenient for humans to remember. He compares this to how IPv4 addresses are difficult to remember and suggests that DNSSEC would offer reasonable security for transactions. The discussion then turns to whether using DNS or HTTPS mapping would be better for name-to-address mapping. While DNS is frequently used as a proxy for identity, HTTPS mapping offers some advantages such as ease of offering up different addresses to different people based on their IP address. However, Rick still believes that Bitcoin being used in the DNS could make DNSSEC more popular. Matt points out that Bitcoin is still a small player and unlikely to have a significant impact on DNSSEC adoption.</summary>
