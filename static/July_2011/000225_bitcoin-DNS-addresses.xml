    <summary>In an email exchange, Rick Wesson suggests using DNS mapping to replace Bitcoin addresses with easily remembered email addresses. He compares this to the way IPv4 addresses are used as metaphors for domain names. While he acknowledges the security benefits of DNSSEC, he also recognizes that it is not widely used. The main benefit of DNS mapping, according to Wesson, is improved usability and user experience. However, in response, Matt argues that implementing a full recursive name server within Bitcoin for secure name-&gt;address mapping would be overkill. Instead, he suggests HTTPS mapping, which offers advantages such as ease of offering different IP addresses to different users. While DNS mapping could be used alongside HTTPS mapping, Matt sees no clear advantage for using DNS over HTTPS.</summary>
