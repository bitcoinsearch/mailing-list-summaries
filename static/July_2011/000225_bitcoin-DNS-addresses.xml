    <summary>In a conversation between Rick Wesson and Matt, the former proposes using email addresses as labels to remember Bitcoin addresses instead of relying on memory. He compares this approach to IPv4 addresses. Rick believes in the security offered by DNSSEC for transactions and suggests implementing a full recursive nameserver inside Bitcoin with hardcoded root trust anchors to make it secure. However, he acknowledges that HTTPS mapping offers some advantages over DNS. Rick's main point is about improving usability and user experience. He thinks that if Bitcoin were used in DNS, it could popularize DNSSEC. But when Matt questions the impact that Bitcoin, which is still a small player, would have on DNSSEC adoption, Rick concedes that it may not make much difference.</summary>
