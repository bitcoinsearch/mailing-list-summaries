    <summary>Pieter Wuille sent an email to a group discussing the standardization of version bytes used by Bitcoin for various applications. He clarifies that this is in reference to version bytes used in addresses and other base58-encoded data structures. Pieter proposes a convention be adopted before everyone creates their own. He provides a proposal with functions for non-alternate chains that are compatible with all currently-used version bytes. The proposal includes an enum dataclass_t with four classes: address, privkey, masterkey, and extended. Additionally, there is an EncodeVersionByte function that takes in the class, nVersion, and fTestNet parameters and returns an encoded version byte.</summary>
