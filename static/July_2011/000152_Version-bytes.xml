    <summary>Pieter Wuille sent an email on July 7th, 2011 to discuss standardizing the version bytes used by bitcoin in various applications. Specifically, he is referring to the version bytes used in addresses and other base58-encoded data structures. He proposes a convention to be adopted before everyone starts defining their own. Pieter then provides a proposal for the functions to be used for non-alternate chains. The proposal includes an enum called "dataclass_t" with four possible values: address, privkey, masterkey, and extended. Pieter's proposed function "EncodeVersionByte" takes in three parameters: "class," which is of type "dataclass_t," "nVersion," which is of type "int," and "fTestNet," which is of type "bool." The function returns a value based on the input parameters using bitwise operations.</summary>
