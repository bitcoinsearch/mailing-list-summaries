    <summary>In an email exchange, Michael Offel expressed his belief that every class should be able to stand on its own in order to be reused in other projects or situations and make it easier to catch and extend the class. However, the respondent points out that beliefs have no weight without actual coding and suggests that shared files are not a major issue for modern SCM. The respondent also highlights the critical importance of blockchain validation logic and the need for new, clean, secondary implementations and good automatic testing shims to find inconsistencies between implementations. The respondent supports the proposal to reimplement parts as libraries and switch to them after validating them, and encourages multiple people to work on such projects to learn from competition in designs/APIs/targets for comparative testing. The respondent concludes by suggesting that testing rigs are often an excellent area of work for people new to a project.</summary>
