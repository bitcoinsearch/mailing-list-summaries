    <summary>In a 2011 email thread, Gavin Andresen and Luke-Jr discussed the idea of creating a "bugfixes only branch" for Bitcoin's core software. The primary concern was to provide a stable base bitcoind for miners, banks, and webservices to apply their patches on top of. Currently, those who want to keep up with development are stuck forward porting against often disruptive changes as just about everyone running something of importance needs some patch or another. This creates a situation where people trail development on some of their systems by many months which is not healthy for the network.Gavin Andresen did not think that a bugfixes-only branch would help much as even bug fixes can disrupt local fixes, and testing and supervising upgrades usually takes more effort than forward porting. He proposed that more effort should be put into mainlining the changes people are carrying sooner and restructuring code to better accommodate patches which aren't suitable for the mainline. This will also encourage people to make the fixes they're running publicly available rather than keeping them private for competitive advantage.Luke-Jr agreed that bug fixes can introduce new bugs, so staying on top of bug fixes implies risking new bugs being introduced. However, he believed that most recently introduced bugs were the result of fixes, not features, given the fairly small number of new features added.</summary>
