    <summary>David Perry and other members of the Bitcoin community discussed the potential for abuse of the Bitcoin alert protocol. Perry suggested that it might be useful to review the system to ensure that only authorized individuals can send an authoritative-looking alert, in case Satoshi's key had been compromised. Gavin Andresen confirmed that he had received Satoshi's key when he left and argued against removing the alert system. The system requires alerts to be signed by a key that only Gavin and Satoshi have, making it virtually impossible to be used for DoS attacks or spam. While some members of the community expressed concerns about the potential for abuse, others acknowledged that the alert system is valuable in cases where there is an urgent problem that requires immediate action, such as the overflow bug. Since the alert system no longer carries the ability to put Bitcoin into RPC safe-mode, they are literally just a message and should not be removed.</summary>
