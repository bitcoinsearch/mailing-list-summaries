    <summary>In a discussion thread on the Bitcoin mailing list, David Perry raised concerns about the alert system and whether anyone besides Satoshi had the ability to send an alert. Gavin Andresen confirmed that Satoshi transferred the key to him when he "left", but there were suggestions to change the alert system to give current developers privileges so that they could ensure that if Satoshiâ€™s key was compromised, no authoritative-looking alert would come up from a malicious source. However, one member of the group questioned why make the key-holder send out two alerts for old clients and new clients and also doubted that Satoshi would let his key get compromised. In another message in the discussion thread, David Perry mentioned that there had been some discussion on the Bitcoin StackExchange site about the alert protocol and whether it carried the potential for abuse (spam/DoS) or was merely deprecated. As a result, Perry forked bitcoin/bitcoin, removed the snippet of code that made the questionable call, and submitted a pull request. Gavin Andresen thought the feature was still more useful than dangerous and argued against removing it. The alert system requires a signature verification when it receives an alert, and while it carries the risk of abuse in much software, it is valuable in financial software like Bitcoin. If there is an urgent problem like the overflow bug, alerts provide a way to notify people to upgrade immediately. Since alerts no longer carry the ability to put Bitcoin into RPC safe-mode, they are literally just a message. Therefore, there is no reason to remove them.</summary>
