    <summary>In a communication between Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn in 2011, Andresen stated that accepting the current transaction types did not prevent the addition of more "standard" transaction types in the future. He believed that two of three was a more useful example than (a or b) as it serves as the prototype for a normal escrow transaction and only results in three addresses and at most two signatures like the (A and B) or C case. Additionally, the functionality of (a or b) can be replicated in a hashish and inefficient way with two of three by simply using a public-known key as one of the roles. Hearn asked if dispute mediation (2-of-3) would not be supported, stating that he thought the plan was also to allow CHECKMULTISIG for smallish numbers of keys. Andresen supported the full RPN boolean validation despite its difficulty in achieving good testing confidence since omitting useful cases was easy.</summary>
