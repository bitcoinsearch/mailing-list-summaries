    <summary>In a discussion between Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn, they talked about the addition of new transaction types in Bitcoin. Gavin Andresen mentioned that accepting these new transaction types does not rule out the possibility of adding more standard transaction types in the future. He also pointed out that the two of three transaction type is far more useful than the (a or b) example as it can be used as a prototype for a normal escrow transaction. Mike Hearn asked if dispute mediation (2-of-3) would still be supported with the addition of the new transaction types, and whether CHECKMULTISIG would be allowed for small numbers of keys. Gavin Andresen emphasized the importance of not omitting useful cases and supported the full RPN boolean validation, despite it being harder to get good testing confidence. Overall, the discussion centered around the potential expansion of transaction types in Bitcoin and ensuring that all valuable use cases are considered.</summary>
