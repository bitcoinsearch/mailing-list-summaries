    <summary>Matt Corallo has announced that Wallet Encryption is in a pull-able state after a lot of discussion and some results. He has requested for final comments and ACKs on the same. The announcement was made via an email thread which included a link to the GitHub pull request where the code for wallet encryption had been rebased. Matt also humorously added that the code was ready for "wtf is this crap" messages. The email thread included additional attachments in the form of HTML and PGP signatures.</summary>
