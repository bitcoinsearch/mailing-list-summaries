    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a developer of Bitcoin, posted on the mailing list requesting for testers with either development environment for native windows and osx platforms. The consensus was to merge autotools and qtgui, but autotools was not tested enough on these platforms. Jaromil has his autotools branch rebased against git master, including Mark's NOSIGPIPE/NOSIGNAL patch. He requested people to test if it compiles and works on several systems such as Ubuntu, Fedora, mingw crosscompile, and osx. A link to the branch was provided in the post. Furthermore, John Smith also requested information about the current roadmap for including the autotools build system so that it will be possible to support multiple GUIs, specifically 0.4.0. Pieter favored merging autotools unless there are still known issues with it like mingw32 compatibility. If the Qt port is functionally complete and stable, Pieter would vote to have it merged under certain conditions, which include minimal/trivial changes to the 'core,' marked as 'experimental,' and not enabled by default.</summary>
