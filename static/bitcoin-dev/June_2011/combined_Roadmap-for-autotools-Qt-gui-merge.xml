    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a developer of Bitcoin, asked for volunteers to test the autotools branch that he and Jaromil have been working on. He mentioned that the consensus was to merge autotools and qtgui, but there were concerns that autotools had not been tested enough on native Windows and OSX platforms. In response, Jaromil has his autotools branch rebased against git master and included Mark's NOSIGPIPE/NOSIGNAL patch. Pieter requested people to test if this compilation works on several systems such as ubuntu, fedora(?), mingw crosscompile, osx, etc. John Smith, another developer of Bitcoin, requested to know the current roadmap for including the autotools build system so that it will be possible to support multiple GUIs in 0.4.0. Pieter stated that he is in favor of merging autotools now unless there are still known issues with it, such as mingw32 compatibility. If the Qt port is functionally complete and stable, Pieter would vote to have it merged as well under certain conditions. These conditions include minimal/trivial changes to the 'core' and being marked as 'experimental' and not enabled by default. The only disadvantage of another GUI is that the necessary cleanup of RPC/GUI code will now need to make changes in three places instead of two. However, more people are willing to work on Qt code than on wx code.</summary>
