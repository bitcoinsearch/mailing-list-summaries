    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a contributor to Bitcoin software, initiated a discussion regarding the merging of autotools and qtgui on June 19th, 2011. However, he noted that autotools was not adequately tested on native Windows and OSX platforms. Jaromil, another contributor, had his autotools branch rebased against git master, and included Mark's NOSIGPIPE/NOSIGNAL patch. He requested people to test if this compiles and works on several systems such as ubuntu, fedora, mingw cross-compile, osx, etc. On the other hand, John Smith informed the community that his Qt GUI is ready for merging and has been functional without any issues. Pieter Wuille suggested merging autotools now unless there are known issues such as mingw32 compatibility. If the Qt port is functionally complete and stable, he would vote to have it merged under certain conditions, including minimal changes to the 'core' and marking it as 'experimental.' The only disadvantage of adding another GUI is that the necessary cleanup of RPC/GUI code will require changes in three places instead of two.</summary>
