    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a developer of Bitcoin software, is looking for anyone who can test the compatibility of autotools on native Windows and OSX platforms. Jaromil has his autotools branch rebased against git master, and included Mark's NOSIGPIPE/NOSIGNAL patch. People are requested to test that it compiles and works on several systems such as ubuntu, fedora, mingw cross-compile, osx, etc. The autotools and qtgui have been proposed to be merged but there are concerns about the testing of autotools on Windows and OSX platforms. John Smith, another developer, states that his Qt GUI is ready for merging and all functionality works. Pieter Wuille suggests merging autotools now if there are no known issues such as mingw32 compatibility. He also proposed to merge the Qt port if it is functionally complete and stable, under certain conditions. The only disadvantage of another GUI is that the cleanup of RPC/GUI code will need changes in 3 places instead of 2, but there are much more people willing to work on Qt code than on wx code.</summary>
