    <summary>The context of the conversation is centered around merging autotools and qtgui, which would allow for support of multiple graphical user interfaces (GUIs). In a message dated June 17, 2011, John Smith expressed that his Qt GUI was ready for merging. Pieter Wuille responded, saying that he was in favor of merging autotools now unless there were still known issues with it, such as mingw32 compatibility. If the Qt port is functionally complete and stable, he would vote to have it merged as well. However, changes to the core must be minimal or trivial, and the new GUI must be marked as "experimental" and not enabled by default. In another message, dated June 19, 2011, Pieter Wuille wrote that the consensus seems to be to merge autotools and qtgui, but autotools is apparently not tested enough on native windows and osx platforms. He asked if anyone on the list had either development environment and willingness to test. Jaromil has his autotools branch rebased against git master, and included Mark's NOSIGPIPE/NOSIGNAL patch. People are asked to test if this compiles and works on several systems, including Ubuntu, Fedora, mingw crosscompile, and OSX. It was noted that for Pieter Wuille, it works on Ubuntu 10.10 amd64, including wx gui.</summary>
