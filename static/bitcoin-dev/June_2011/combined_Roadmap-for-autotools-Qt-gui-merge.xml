    <summary>In June 2011, a discussion took place on the Bitcoin development mailing list regarding the merging of autotools and qtgui. The consensus was to merge the two, but one developer noted that autotools had not been tested enough on native Windows and OS X platforms. Another developer, Jaromil, rebased his autotools branch against git master and included Mark's NOSIGPIPE/NOSIGNAL patch. He asked people to test whether it compiles and works on several systems, including Ubuntu, Fedora, Mingw cross-compile, and OS X. Meanwhile, another developer, John Smith, said that his Qt GUI was ready for merging, and asked about the current roadmap for including the autotools build system to support multiple GUIs. One developer, Pieter, was in favor of merging autotools now, while another noted that the changes to the core should be minimal/trivial and marked as 'experimental', and not enabled by default.</summary>
