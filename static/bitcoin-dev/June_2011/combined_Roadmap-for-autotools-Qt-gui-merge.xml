    <summary>In June 2011, Pieter Wuille posted on a mailing list regarding merging autotools and qtgui. However, the autotools branch had not been tested enough on native Windows and OSX platforms. Jaromil had his autotools branch rebased against git master, including Mark's NOSIGPIPE/NOSIGNAL patch, and requested people to test if it compiled and worked on several systems such as Ubuntu, Fedora, mingw cross-compile, OSX, etc. The link provided to test was https://github.com/jaromil/bitcoin/commits/autotools3. According to Pieter, he tested the system on Ubuntu 10.10 amd64, including wx GUI and found it working. On the same thread, John Smith enquired about the current roadmap for including the autotools build system so that it would be possible to support multiple GUIs in 0.4.0. Pieter replied that he was in favor of merging autotools unless there were any known issues with it, such as mingw32 compatibility. He also added that if the Qt port was functionally complete and stable, he would vote to have it merged as well under certain conditions. These conditions included the changes to the 'core' being minimal/trivial, marked as 'experimental,' and not enabled by default. Although the necessary cleanup of RPC/GUI code would now need changes in three places instead of two, there were more people willing to work on Qt code than on wx code, according to Pieter.</summary>
