    <summary>In a discussion among Bitcoin developers, Pieter Wuille suggested merging autotools and qtgui, but noted that autotools had not been sufficiently tested on Windows and OSX platforms. Jaromil's autotools branch was mentioned, which he had rebased against git master and included Mark's NOSIGPIPE/NOSIGNAL patch. People were asked to test it on several systems, including Ubuntu, Fedora, mingw crosscompile, and OSX. Pieter stated that it worked for him on Ubuntu 10.10 amd64, including wx gui. Another developer, John Smith, asked about the current roadmap for including the autotools build system, so that multiple GUIs could be supported, and mentioned that his Qt GUI was almost ready for merging. Pieter expressed support for merging autotools now, as long as the changes to the 'core' were minimal/trivial and marked as 'experimental', and not enabled by default. The only disadvantage of another GUI would be that cleanup of RPC/GUI code would need changes in three places instead of two, but more people were willing to work on Qt code than on wx code.</summary>
