    <summary>In the discussion of enhancing security measures within blockchain systems, a novel approach is suggested that revolves around making the public key identity verification an interactive process instead of relying solely on on-chain mechanisms. This method presents a significant advantage in terms of security management, specifically addressing issues like revoking access to leaked keys and implementing an expiration mechanism for keys. These measures are crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of blockchain systems, as they allow system administrators or users to dynamically manage access and prevent unauthorized use of compromised keys. 

By introducing interactivity into the pubkey identity check, it becomes possible to add layers of security protocols that can adapt to emerging threats or vulnerabilities. This flexibility is essential in the fast-evolving digital landscape, where new types of cyber threats emerge with increasing sophistication. The interactive approach could potentially pave the way for more secure blockchain applications, ensuring that only authorized users have access and that this access can be quickly revoked or timed out when necessary. 

The implementation of such a system would require careful consideration of user experience and system efficiency, balancing security needs with usability. However, the benefits in terms of enhanced security and control over key management could significantly outweigh these challenges, offering a robust solution to some of the persistent security concerns in blockchain technology.</summary>
