    <summary>One suggestion for addressing the issue at hand is to introduce a new opcode called OP_CSV_ALLINPUTS. This opcode would require that all inputs in a transaction have a matching nSequence, and it could be used in the HTLC preimage branch by including `1 OP_CSV_ALLINPUTS`. By doing so, unconfirmed outputs would be prevented from being used in the HTLC-preimage-spending transaction, effectively protecting it against the replacement cycling attack.Alternatively, instead of OP_CSV_ALLINPUTS, OP_CSV_OTHERINPUTS could be used. This opcode would allow the HTLC output itself to be spent immediately via the preimage branch, while still requiring that any additional inputs added for fees are confirmed.By implementing either of these solutions, the HTLC-preimage-spending transaction would be safeguarded against the replacement cycling attack. It is important to note that the specific choice between OP_CSV_ALLINPUTS and OP_CSV_OTHERINPUTS would depend on the desired functionality and requirements of the system.To explore this topic further and understand the implications and potential benefits of these opcodes, you can refer to the original email for more details.Please note that the farewell part of the email has been omitted from this summary.</summary>
