    <summary>In a recent email, the sender acknowledges that there was no previous context discussed. They apologize for any language errors as English is not their native language. The sender mentions a previous email from August 11, 2023, where they discussed conducting experiments pre-disclosure. They express their willingness to set up a "black box" Lightning infrastructure on mainnet and exercise vulnerabilities and mitigations. They suggest revisiting the disclosure date based on the learnings from these experiments.

However, the sender points out that the number of Lightning worldwide experts who have the necessary knowledge and understanding to participate in these experiments may be limited to those listed on the disclosure emails. Additionally, at the time of the email, there were other pending non-disclosed security issues, such as the "fake channel DoS vector" revealed on August 23, 2023. Due to these factors, the experiments were not conducted.

Overall, the email touches upon the intention to conduct pre-disclosure experiments to test vulnerabilities and mitigations in a "black box" Lightning infrastructure on mainnet. It also highlights the constraints of limited expertise and the presence of other pending security issues.</summary>
