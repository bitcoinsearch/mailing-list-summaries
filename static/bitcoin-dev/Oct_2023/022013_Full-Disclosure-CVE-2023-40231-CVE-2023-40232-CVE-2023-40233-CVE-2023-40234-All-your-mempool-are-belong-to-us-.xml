    <summary>The email begins with a clarification that there is no previous context related to the discussion. The sender apologizes for any language mistakes, as English is not their native language. The sender refers to a previous email from August 11th, 2023, where they discussed conducting experiments before disclosing vulnerabilities. They express their willingness to participate in setting up a "black box" Lightning infrastructure on the mainnet and exercising vulnerabilities and mitigations based on the learnings. However, the sender mentions that the number of Lightning worldwide experts who have the necessary knowledge and understanding to participate in the experiments is limited to those listed on the disclosure emails. Additionally, the sender explains that they did not conduct the experiments due to other pending non-disclosed security issues, such as the "fake channel DoS vector" revealed on August 23rd, 2023.</summary>
