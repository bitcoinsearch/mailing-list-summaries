    <summary>The email discusses the topic of storing ephemeral data, specifically focusing on HTLC (Hashed Time-Lock Contracts) transactions and commitment transactions in the context of lightning network. One key point mentioned is that since lightning network uses disclosed secrets to invalidate old state, it is not necessary to keep every signature from your counterparty indefinitely.In terms of storage requirements, the email mentions that for each channel, there would be a need for &gt; RBF (Replace-By-Fee) which has a minimum incremental relay fee of 1sat/vByte by default. It is also highlighted that combining multiple SIGHASH_SINGLE transactions together does not result in significant savings, as the savings are only around 18 bytes for nVersion, nLockTime, and the txin and txout size fields. The HTLC-timeout transaction is noted to be 166.5 vBytes, resulting in a savings of just 11%.The email acknowledges the possibility of needing to fee bump and add an additional input, which takes up space and may require a change output. In such cases, it suggests that using a pre-signed transaction may have been more efficient. Additionally, it is mentioned that the assumption of having lots of HTLCs in flight that need to be spent may not always be the case.The email concludes with a link to Peter Todd's website (https://petertodd.org) and his email address (peter@petertodd.org).</summary>
