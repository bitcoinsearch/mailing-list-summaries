    <summary>The email discusses the topic of storing ephemeral data, specifically related to HTLC (Hashed Time-Lock Contracts) transactions and possibly commitment transactions. The lightning network uses disclosed secrets to invalidate old states, which means that there is no need to keep every signature from the counterparty indefinitely. 

For each channel, considering the given numbers, it is mentioned that RBF (Replace-by-Fee) has a minimum incremental relay fee of 1sat/vByte by default. This implies that if you use SIGHASH_SINGLE, which requires one output per input, combining multiple SIGHASH_SINGLE transactions does not result in significant savings. The only savings would be the 18 bytes for nVersion, nLockTime, and the txin and txout size fields. On the other hand, the HTLC-timeout transaction is 166.5 vBytes, resulting in a savings of just 11%. 

However, it is acknowledged that if there is a need to fee bump and add an additional input, it takes up space and may require a change output. In such cases, using a pre-signed transaction would likely have been a better option. It is also mentioned that the assumption of having lots of HTLCs in flight that need to be spent is often not the case.
