    <summary>The email discusses the problem of failing to use RBF (Replace-By-Fee) in pre-signed transactions. The sender suggests that the correct approach is to pre-sign enough different transactions to cover all reasonable needs for bumping fees. They propose increasing the fee by 2x each time and pre-signing 10 different replacement transactions, which would cover a fee range of 1024x. It is mentioned that the multiplier can be increased towards the end of the range to further improve the approach.The sender emphasizes that increasing per-tx (temporary) storage and bandwidth costs by approximately 10x or even 100x is not a significant issue in the context of a highly scalable protocol like Lightning. They argue that there is no reason why the B-&gt;C transactions should be getting stuck and consider this as a major failing of the Lightning protocol that needs to be addressed. They suggest applying the fix to other aspects of the lightning protocol, such as channel opens.The email also includes a link to https://petertodd.org, which can provide more information on the topic. The email address 'peter'[:-1]@petertodd.org is mentioned as the sender's contact information.</summary>
