    <summary>The email discusses the idea of interleaving presigned transactions in order to reduce the risks of mempool split and prevent scenario where half of the nodes have a transaction to Alice and the other half have a transaction to Bob, both with the same fee. The author suggests that by interleaving the transactions fee-wise (e.g. 1.1 to Alice, 1.2 to Bob, etc.), any new transaction would evict all previous transactions in the chain. This approach aims to mitigate the possibility of replacement cycling attacks. Though the author is unsure about the specific use of this technique in such attacks, they believe it is safer to prevent the scenario altogether.</summary>
