    <summary>The email suggests a solution to prevent mempool split and reduce the risk of replacement cycling attacks. The proposal is to interleaved presigned transactions fee-wise, where transactions are allocated to different recipients in a sequential manner. For example, transaction 1.1 would be assigned to Alice, followed by transaction 1.2 to Bob, then transaction 1.3 to Alice again, and so on. Each new transaction in the chain would evict all previous transactions.The purpose of this approach is to avoid situations where multiple transactions with the same fee are sent to different recipients, resulting in a mempool split. In such cases, half of the nodes may have the transaction to Alice in their mempools, while the other half has the transaction to Bob. This scenario increases the risk of inconsistencies and potential vulnerabilities, such as replacement cycling attacks.Although the email does not delve into the specifics of replacement cycling attacks, the proposed solution aims to mitigate this risk by ensuring that transactions are allocated in a way that prevents such scenarios from occurring.By implementing the suggested approach of interleaving presigned transactions fee-wise, it is believed that the risks associated with mempool splits and replacement cycling attacks can be minimized. This strategy enhances the overall safety and reliability of the system.Best regards,Boris Nagaev</summary>
