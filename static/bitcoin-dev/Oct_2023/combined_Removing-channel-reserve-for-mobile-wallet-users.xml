    <summary>In this email, the sender (Ziggie) is responding to a previous message from Bastien. Ziggie expresses support for introducing a 0-channel reserve option into the protocol via an optional feature bit. They suggest that while it makes sense to have a reserve when running a routing node, it would be beneficial to have the option to open zero-reserve channels. Ziggie mentions that this request pops up occasionally in noderunner groups.

Ziggie also suggests that if the zero-reserve feature is implemented, it should be restricted via a channel interceptor to ensure that only channels with the zero-reserve feature bit are accepted. They mention that this approach is similar to how zero-conf channels are handled, but they note that the implementation details may vary.

Additionally, Ziggie mentions that it would be useful to include information on how to prove possible cheating attacks in the specification or blip. They ask if the issue of cheating attacks has already been reported.

Overall, Ziggie's email expresses support for the proposed 0-channel reserve option and suggests ways to address potential implementation concerns and provide more information in the spec/blip.</summary>
