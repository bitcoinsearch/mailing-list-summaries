    <summary>The email discusses a vulnerability in the Lightning Network that can be exploited by attackers. The vulnerability is primarily applicable to pre-anchor channels, but it can also be performed on anchor channels. In the case of anchor channels, the attack can be executed by either side of the closure.

The attack takes advantage of the fact that the HTLCs (Hashed Time-Locked Contracts) in anchor channels are only signed with SIGHASH_SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY, which allows for additional inputs to be added. This means that even the broadcaster can perform this attack. 

Addressing this issue solely on the lightning end is not the optimal approach. Instead, the fix should lie with Bitcoin Core or other parts of the mining stack. However, fixing this in the Bitcoin Core stack presents challenges, as it would require unbounded memory to keep enough history to address the issue. 

One possible solution mentioned in the email is the use of external software that monitors the mempool for transactions replaced out but which may re-enter later with other replacements. This software could optimize block template selection and inadvertently fix the vulnerability.

It is important to note that fixing this particular issue may not be feasible without addressing other channel usability issues and edge cases. Therefore, it is unlikely that the change will be reversed to solely fix this vulnerability.

Overall, the email highlights the need to address the vulnerability in the Lightning Network on a broader scale, involving Bitcoin Core or other parts of the mining stack.</summary>
