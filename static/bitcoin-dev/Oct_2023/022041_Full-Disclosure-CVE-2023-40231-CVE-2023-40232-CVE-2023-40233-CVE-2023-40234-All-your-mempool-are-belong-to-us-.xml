    <summary>The email discusses a vulnerability in the lightning network that allows for an attack on pre-anchor channels. However, with anchor channels, the attack can be performed by either side of the closure. This is because the HTLCs are now only signed with SIGHASH_SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY, allowing for more inputs to be added and the attack to be carried out even by the broadcaster. The email suggests that fixing this issue on the lightning end is not the right approach, as it is ultimately a problem with transaction broadcast ordering and miners not including the optimal set of transactions for fee revenue.The email proposes that the fix should lie with Bitcoin Core or other parts of the mining stack. However, fixing this in the Bitcoin Core stack would require unbounded memory, which is not feasible. Instead, the email suggests the possibility of using external software to monitor the mempool for transactions that were replaced out but could potentially re-enter the mempool later with other replacements. This software could optimize block template selection and inadvertently fix the vulnerability.Overall, the email highlights the complexity of addressing this vulnerability and suggests that a solution needs to be found at the core level of the Bitcoin network rather than the lightning network.</summary>
