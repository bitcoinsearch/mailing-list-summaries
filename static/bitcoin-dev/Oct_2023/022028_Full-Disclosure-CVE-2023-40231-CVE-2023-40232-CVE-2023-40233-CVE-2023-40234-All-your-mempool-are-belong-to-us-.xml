    <summary>The email discusses the concept of replacement cycles in the context of an attack on a defender's implementation. The attacker aims to reduce the cost of the attack by avoiding some replacement cycles. However, the defender has implemented a scorched-earth fee bumping policy to counter this strategy.

Under the scorched-earth policy, there are two possible outcomes: either the HTLC-timeout will confirm in the next block, or the attacker must pay more fees than the HTLC-timeout fees to replace it. As the deadline for CLTV delta approaches, the fees in the second case may reach 50%, 80%, or even 100% of the HTLC value. This policy aims to make the attack unprofitable for the attacker.

In practice, given that the HTLC values are significantly higher than the next-block fee cost, the attacker will likely need to perform multiple replacements as the deadline approaches. The linear scorched-earth policy described is just an illustration, and further adjustments should be made to the fee bumping curve across the full CLTV delta to ensure minimal fees are paid when not under attack.

As the deadline approaches, it is advisable to become very aggressive with fee bumping to increase the chances of transaction confirmation during high mempool congestion and to deter replacement-cycling attackers.

Please note that the farewell part of the email has been ignored as per the given rules.</summary>
