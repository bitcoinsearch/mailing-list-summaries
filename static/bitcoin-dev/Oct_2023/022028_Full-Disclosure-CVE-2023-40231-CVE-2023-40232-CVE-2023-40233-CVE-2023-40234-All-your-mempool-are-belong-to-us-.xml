    <summary>The email discusses the concept of reducing the cost of an attack by avoiding certain replacement cycles. The attacker can achieve this by implementing a scorched-earth fee bumping policy. However, there are two possible outcomes: either the HTLC-timeout will confirm in the next block, or the attacker will have to pay more fees than the HTLC-timeout fees to replace it. As the CLTV delta deadline approaches, the fees required for replacement may increase significantly, potentially reaching 50%, 80%, or even 100% of the HTLC value under the scorched earth policy. This means that even if the attacker only needs to perform one replacement cycle right before the deadline, the attack can still be rendered unprofitable. In reality, when dealing with HTLC values that are much higher than the next-block fee cost, multiple replacements may be necessary as the deadline approaches.It is important to note that the linear scorched earth policy mentioned in the email is just an illustration. Further adjustments should be made to the fee bumping curve across the entire CLTV delta to ensure minimal fees are paid when not under attack. However, as the deadline draws near, it becomes advantageous to adopt an aggressive approach to both confirm transactions during high mempool congestion and penalize replacement-cycling attackers.Overall, the email emphasizes the importance of considering fee bumping strategies and the potential impact on the profitability of attacks as the deadline for CLTV delta approaches.</summary>
