    <summary>The email discusses the concept of increasing the multiplier in the context of fee bumps. The sender clarifies that increasing the multiplier refers to starting with a smaller multiplier at the beginning of the range and ending with a bigger one. This approach is illustrated using fee increases pre-signed with specific multipliers such as 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.8, 2.6, 4.2, 7.4, etc.

By implementing this strategy, most of the range is utilized for smaller fee bumps as a percentage, while larger fee bumps are reserved for the end of the range, where the strategy changes to something more "scorched-earth."

The sender emphasizes that properly applying this idea to commitment transactions would involve removing HTLCs (Hash Time-Locked Contracts) from replacements when their value drops below the necessary fees required to mine those outputs.

Furthermore, it is mentioned that multiple variants of transactions can be signed simultaneously, deducting fees from different parties' outputs. For example, Alice can give Bob the ability to broadcast higher fee transactions, taking the fees from Bob's output(s), and vice versa. The sender acknowledges that they haven't considered how this would work with musig (MuSig), but state that it can certainly be achieved with OP_CheckMultisig.

The email concludes with a link to Peter Todd's website (https://petertodd.org) and the sender's contact information.</summary>
