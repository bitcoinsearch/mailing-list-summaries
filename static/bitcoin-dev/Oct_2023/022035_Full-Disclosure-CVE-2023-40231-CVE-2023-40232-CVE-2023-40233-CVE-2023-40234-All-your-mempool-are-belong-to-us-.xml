    <summary>The email discusses the concept of increasing the multiplier for fee bumps in transactions. The sender clarifies that increasing the multiplier refers to starting with a smaller multiplier at the beginning of the range and ending with a bigger one. They provide an example of fee increases pre-signed with multipliers such as 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.8, 2.6, 4.2, 7.4, etc. This approach allows for smaller percentage bumps at the beginning of the range and larger percentage bumps towards the end.The sender suggests that this strategy can be used to use most of the range for smaller bumps, with larger percentage bumps reserved for when the strategy changes to something more "scorched-earth". Additionally, they mention that applying this idea to commitment transactions would involve removing HTLCs (Hashed Time Lock Contracts) when their value drops below the necessary fees for mining those outputs.The sender also mentions the possibility of signing simultaneous variants of transactions where the fees are deducted from different parties' outputs. For example, Alice can give Bob the ability to broadcast higher fee transactions, deducting the fees from Bob's outputs, and vice versa. They acknowledge that they haven't fully thought through how this would work with musig, but it can be done with plain old OP_CheckMultisig.To further explore the topic, the sender includes a link to Peter Todd's website, https://petertodd.org, and provides an email address for Peter Todd: 'peter'[:-1]@petertodd.org.</summary>
