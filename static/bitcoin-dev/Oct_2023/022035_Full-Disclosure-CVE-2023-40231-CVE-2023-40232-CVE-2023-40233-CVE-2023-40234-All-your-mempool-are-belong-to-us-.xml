    <summary>The email discusses the concept of increasing the multiplier in the context of fee-bumping. This involves starting with a smaller multiplier at the beginning of the range and ending with a bigger one. The purpose of this approach is to use a higher percentage of the range for smaller fee increases, while reserving larger percentage increases for later stages where a more aggressive strategy is required.

The idea is to apply this concept to commitment transactions, which may involve removing HTLCs (Hash Time Locked Contracts) when their value drops below the fees needed to include them in mined outputs. This means that replacements of commitment transactions may have HTLCs removed if their value decreases below the necessary fee level.

The email also mentions the possibility of signing simultaneous variants of transactions that deduct fees from different parties' outputs. For example, Alice can give Bob the ability to broadcast higher fee transactions by taking the fees from Bob's output(s), and Bob can give Alice the same ability by taking the fees from Alice's output(s). This approach is feasible with OP_CheckMultisig, but its compatibility with musig (multi-signature) is not fully explored.

Overall, the email presents ideas and considerations related to increasing the multiplier and implementing it in fee-bumping strategies for commitment transactions. It also mentions the ability to sign simultaneous transaction variants that deduct fees from different party's outputs. Further exploration and analysis are needed to fully understand the implications and potential applications of these concepts.
