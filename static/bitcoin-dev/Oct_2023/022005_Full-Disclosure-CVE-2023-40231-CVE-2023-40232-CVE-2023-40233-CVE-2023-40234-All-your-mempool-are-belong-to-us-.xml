    <summary>In the email, the sender expresses gratitude for a detailed explanation on pinning attacks and raises a request for more information about an observed attack on the mainnet. They inquire about tools that can be used to monitor suspicious behavior and ask for specific details on how the attack was monitored on the chain.The sender also brings up the point that controlling two neighboring nodes is not necessary to target a victim. By cycling the attack on the tail side and delaying the confirmation of the htlc-timeout covenant, the peer at the front of the victim will force-close the channel and claim their timeout-path in the same way, canceling back the initial htlc amount to the attacker's initial node.Additionally, the sender suggests introducing a feebumping race between the victim and the attacker on the tail side of the attack to make it even more costly. They propose fee-bumping the htlc-output aggressively if the preimage is seen and can also be claimed via the htlc-timeout path. This would only be feasible with anchor channels where fees can be added to the htlc-covenant. The suggestion is to use fees up to 50% of the htlc value, making the attack more costly for the peer attempting to steal the htlc.Lastly, the sender recommends another mitigation for node runners, which is to restrict the amount and number of HTLCs for big channels to unknown peers. They emphasize that this restriction quickly leads to a loss for the attacker when the HTLCs they attempt to steal are small.Overall, the email discusses pinning attacks, requests more information about a specific attack, proposes monitoring tools, highlights the possibility of targeting a victim without controlling two neighboring nodes, suggests introducing a feebumping race to increase the cost of the attack, and recommends restricting the amount and number of HTLCs for big channels to unknown peers as a mitigation.</summary>
