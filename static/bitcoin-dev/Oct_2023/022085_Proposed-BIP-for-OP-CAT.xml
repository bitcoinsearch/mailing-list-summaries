    <summary>The email discusses the use of the opcode OP_SUCCESS126 and argues that there is no reason not to use it. The author acknowledges that in certain codebases, such as Core, there may be two constants for the opcode OP_CAT, which could lead to confusion. However, the author does not see this as a sufficient reason to avoid using OP_SUCCESS126.</summary>
