    <summary>The email discusses an alternate design proposal for adding an `nExpiryTime` field in taproot annex. This field indicates that a transaction must not exist in a block at or above the specified height. The suggestion is to categorize transactions in the mempool into buckets based on their `nExpiryTime`, and if a block is reached, all buckets with `nExpiryTime` less than that block height should be dropped.

Additionally, the proposal suggests adding an `OP_CHECKEXPIRYTIMEVERIFY` opcode, which behaves similarly to the `OP_EXPIRE` opcode proposed by Peter Todd. The opcode checks if the `nExpiryTime` field exists and has a value equal to or less than the top of the stack. The main difference between this proposal and Peter's is that this proposal suggests an explicit field for `nExpiryTime` in the taproot annex, while Peter's proposal proposes an implicit field in `CTransaction`.

The author emphasizes that the use of explicit fields is preferable, as it makes the design more clear and easier to implement by non-Bitcoin-core implementations. The hope is that this approach will improve the implementation of the design across different implementations.

Overall, the email presents an alternative design for incorporating an `nExpiryTime` field and suggests using explicit fields for better implementation clarity.</summary>
