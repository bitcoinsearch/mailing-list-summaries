    <summary>In this email, the sender discusses their involvement with the development of the lightning network and its implementations. They mention that they have halted their involvement effective immediately and have informed senior lightning developers about this decision. The sender also mentions closing an old issue related to this purpose on the bolt repository.

The sender expresses concern about a new class of replacement cycling attacks that puts the lightning network in a precarious position. They believe that a sustainable fix can only happen at the base-layer, such as adding a memory-intensive history of all-seen transactions or implementing a consensus upgrade. While deployed mitigations may be effective against simple attacks, the sender doubts their effectiveness against advanced attackers, as mentioned in a previous full disclosure mail.

The sender emphasizes the importance of transparency and community buy-in for changes that alter the processing requirements of full-nodes or the security architecture of the decentralized bitcoin ecosystem. They acknowledge the challenge of fully explaining the need for these changes while also providing practical and critical attack scenarios on a large BTC ecosystem.

The sender mentions that they will refrain from discussing these issues on public mailing lists until the week of October 30th. They state that enough material has already been published and that other experts are available to contribute to the discussion. Afterward, the sender plans to shift their focus back to bitcoin core.

Overall, the email highlights the sender's decision to step away from the lightning network development due to concerns about the vulnerability of the network to certain types of attacks. They stress the need for careful consideration and community involvement in addressing these issues and express their intention to return to focusing on bitcoin core in the future.</summary>
