    <summary>In the email, the sender mentions that they have written a reply regarding the economics of sequential malicious replacement of honest HTLC-timeout. They also mention that they have conducted a test on the core mempool, and it works as expected. The sender provides a link to the commit on GitHub for reference.The sender then discusses the responsible disclosure process, comparing it to how hardware issues affecting the operating system are handled in the Linux kernel. They provide a link to the documentation on the process for embargoed hardware issues.The sender states that they are halting their involvement with the development of the lightning network and its implementations. They mention informing some senior lightning developers about this decision. They also mention closing an old issue related to this decision on the bolt repository and provide a link to it.The sender expresses their concern about a new class of replacement cycling attacks that puts lightning in a perilous position. They suggest that a sustainable fix may be needed at the base-layer, such as adding a memory-intensive history of all-seen transactions or a consensus upgrade. They mention that deployed mitigations are effective against simple attacks but may not be enough to stop advanced attackers.The sender acknowledges that making such changes would require transparency and buy-in from the community. They mention the difficulty of fully explaining the need for these changes without revealing practical and critical attacks on the decentralized bitcoin ecosystem. They highlight the importance of getting these changes right the first time, as there may not be a second chance to fix them.The sender states that they will remain silent on these issues on public mailing lists until the week of October 30th. They believe that enough material has been published and that other experts are available. After that, they plan to focus more on bitcoin core.The email ends with a farewell message, which should be ignored as per the rules provided.</summary>
