    <summary>Jacob GÃ¶ker Swambo, a member of the Bitcoin community, has shared his PhD thesis titled "Evolving Bitcoin Custody." The thesis explores the design and analysis of Bitcoin custody systems in the face of technological advancements and evolving threats. The full thesis can be accessed on ArXiv at https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11911.In his research, Swambo focuses on deleted-key covenants within Bitcoin. He emphasizes the need for comprehensive specifications and thorough analysis when proposing covenant changes that require soft-forks. This approach ensures potential risks are identified and addressed, thus protecting users from undue harm.One significant challenge identified by Swambo relates to coin-control difficulties and their impact on user experience. To effectively tackle these challenges, he suggests the adoption of more granular covenants, such as the INSPECT_X implemented in the Liquid sidechain.Swambo also introduces the Ajolote custody system as a theoretical case study. While not intended for implementation, this system serves as a conceptual framework to facilitate discussions and developments in the field of custody systems. Although Ajolote may be overly complex for practical use, it offers valuable insights into the ongoing debate surrounding bitcoin covenants and vaults.Custody system designers may find the security analysis approach outlined in Swambo's thesis particularly useful. The methodology employed addresses the multifaceted challenges faced by custody systems and provides a structured framework for evaluation and enhancement. Swambo encourages designers to explore and potentially integrate this attack model and methodology into their own system's security analysis. He is open to discussions and collaborations in this domain.Overall, Swambo's thesis contributes to the understanding and development of Bitcoin custody systems. Feedback and questions regarding the thesis are welcome, as they will shape the future of custody systems and covenants.</summary>
