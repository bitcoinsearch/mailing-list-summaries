    <summary>In the email, the sender expresses gratitude to Antoine for providing a comprehensive write-up on an issue and for diligently reporting it to various implementations. The sender also acknowledges Antoine's efforts in collaborating with them to develop mitigation strategies and analyze attack scenarios.

The sender provides a clarification stating that all relevant mitigations for lnd (Lightning Network Daemon) were implemented in lnd v0.16.1-beta, which was released on April 24th, 2023. However, they mention that some performance regressions were introduced due to these mitigations, specifically related to mempool watching. 

To address this issue, the sender informs Antoine that in version 0.17.1 of lnd, they will start utilizing the new `gettxspendingprevout` RPC call with bitcoind. This update aims to further reduce the load and improve performance.

It is important to note that the farewell part of the email should be ignored as per the given instructions.</summary>
