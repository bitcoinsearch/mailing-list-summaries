    <summary>A new transaction-relay jamming attack affecting lightning channels was discovered in December 2022. This attack exposes lightning routing hops carrying HTLC traffic to loss of funds security risks. Mitigations for this attack have been designed, implemented, and deployed by major lightning implementations. The attack involves a malicious channel counterparty broadcasting an HTLC-preimage transaction with a higher fee than the honest HTLC-timeout of the victim lightning node, triggering a replacement. To mitigate this attack, several measures have been implemented and deployed by various lightning implementations, including aggressive rebroadcasting, local-mempool preimage monitoring, and a bump in the default CLTV delta. The email also mentions potential affected bitcoin applications such as on-chain DLCs, coinjoins, payjoins, wallets with time-sensitive paths, peerswap and submarine swaps, batch payouts, and transaction "accelerators". Additionally, the email discusses package malleability pinning attacks and the implications of the replacement cycling attack for package relay and the nversion=3 policy. The author shares a timeline of events leading up to the reporting of the attack and expresses concerns about the practicality of replacement cycling attacks for advanced attackers. They also raise the possibility of a more severe long-term package malleability critical security issue affecting lightning and other time-sensitive multi-party protocols. The author invites technical peers and the bitcoin community to further investigate these issues and provide dissenting opinions, emphasizing the importance of verifying information.</summary>
