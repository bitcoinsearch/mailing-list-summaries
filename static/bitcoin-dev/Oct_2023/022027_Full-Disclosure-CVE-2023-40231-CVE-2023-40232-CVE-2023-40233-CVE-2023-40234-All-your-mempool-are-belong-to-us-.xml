    <summary>The email discusses a paper on the topic of defensive fee-rebroadcasting, specifically in subsection 3.4. The paper can be found at this link: https://github.com/ariard/mempool-research/blob/2023-10-replacement-paper/replacement-cycling.pdf.The sender mentions that when there is a backlog in the mempool and the defensive fractional fee HTLC-timeout becomes stuck, it gives an advantage to the attacker. Additionally, the sender speculates that an attacker could replace-cycle multiple honest HTLC-timeouts with a single malicious HTLC-preimage, paying only the absolute fee while imposing the RBF penalty. Although the sender has not tested this specific behavior, they note that the "fees" math appears to be disadvantageous for defenders.Overall, the email raises concerns about the impact of certain behaviors in the context of defensive fee-rebroadcasting.</summary>
