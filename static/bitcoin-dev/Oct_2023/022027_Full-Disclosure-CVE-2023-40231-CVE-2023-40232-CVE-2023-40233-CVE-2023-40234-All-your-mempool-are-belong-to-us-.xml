    <summary>The email discusses a specific mitigation mentioned in an attached paper, which is focused on defensive fee-rebroadcasting. The sender points out that when there is a mempool backlog and the defensive fractional fee HTLC-timeout remains stuck, it gives an advantage to the attacker. Additionally, the sender suggests that an attacker can replace-cycle multiple honest HTLC-timeouts with a single malicious HTLC-preimage by paying the absolute fee but only incurring the RBF penalty. Although the sender did not test this specific behavior, they mention that the "fees" math doesn't seem advantageous for the defenders at first glance.</summary>
