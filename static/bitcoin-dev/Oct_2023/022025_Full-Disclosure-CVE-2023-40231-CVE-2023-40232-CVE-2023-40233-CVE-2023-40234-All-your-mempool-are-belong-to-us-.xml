    <summary>The email discusses a potential solution to a problem related to the mempool fees and HTLC value. The author mentions that while many nodes already have a similar mechanism in place, it is not sufficient as it requires the victim to spend more than the prevailing mempool fees and potentially burn a large percentage of their HTLC value. The author's comment suggests that the problem has not been fully resolved yet. The email is a response to another person named Matt Morehouse.</summary>
