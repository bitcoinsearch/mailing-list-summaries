    <summary>The email discusses the disclosure of a third mitigation technique in addition to mempool scanning and transaction re-signing/re-broadcasting. This third technique involves bumping CLTV delta, which is a basic line of defense against lightning attacks. Bumping CLTV delta allows node operators to intervene and re-broadcast time-sensitive transactions on other interfaces if their primary node is eclipsed. The effectiveness of the second mitigation technique, transaction re-signing, in imposing an economic cost on the attack is unclear. It is uncertain if the game theory behind this cost holds true.

The email suggests that the deployment of stratum v2 could make the attack more difficult. By increasing the number of miners with their own block templates, it increases the number of miners' mempools that the attacker has to continuously replace channels counterparties transactions in cycles. One possible mitigation to this attack is implementing a replacement buffer or history of transactions at the mempool level. However, it remains to be seen if this can be made robust enough. The author wonders if individuals like Tadge or Rusty, who have been involved in the early design of lightning, have additional ideas for mitigations.

Fees are noted as a challenging issue in the original paper, but no further information is provided about this topic in the email.</summary>
