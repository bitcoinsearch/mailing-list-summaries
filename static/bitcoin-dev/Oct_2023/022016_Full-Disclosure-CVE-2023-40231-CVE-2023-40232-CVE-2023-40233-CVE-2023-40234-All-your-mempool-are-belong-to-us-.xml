    <summary>The email discusses the disclosure mails that mentioned a third mitigation technique for lightning attacks, which is bumping CLTV delta. This technique allows node operators to intervene and re-broadcast their time-sensitive transactions on other interfaces if their primary interface is eclipsed. The second mitigation technique mentioned is transaction re-signing, which imposes an economic cost on the attack in terms of fees. However, it is unclear if this cost is effective in deterring the attack. The deployment of stratum v2 is suggested as a way to make the attack more difficult by increasing the number of miners and their mempools that the attacker needs to continuously replace channels counterparties transactions in cycles. It is proposed that a replacement buffer or history of transactions at the mempool level could be a potential mitigation for this attack, but its effectiveness is yet to be determined. The email also mentions that individuals involved in the early design of lightning, such as Tadge and Rusty, may have additional ideas for mitigations. The issue of fees is highlighted as a challenging aspect in the original paper.</summary>
