    <summary>The email discusses the issue of where certain wallet-related protocols should be stored and tracked. The sender mentions that these protocols, such as BIP69 (sorted keys), ypubs, and zpubs, are currently not considered BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) and suggests finding another specification repository for them. The SLIP repo is proposed as a possible solution, as it would prevent these protocols from being lost and allow for updates to be tracked. However, the sender expresses their dissatisfaction with this situation and states a preference for OpenTimestamps to be a BIP.

The sender also mentions that the Lightning Network (LN) is unique in that it has its own spec repo, which is actively maintained and used. They clarify that while BIPs technically require approval from Core maintainers to be merged, the approval process should be automatic and not based on the relevance or interest to Core developers.

The email concludes with the sender's contact information: Andrew Poelstra, Director of Research at Blockstream, with an email address and website provided. A quote unrelated to the email content is included at the end.</summary>
