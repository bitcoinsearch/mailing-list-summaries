    <summary>In an email from Peter Todd, he discusses the issue of Lightning and the increasing amount of data that needs to be stored for larger nodes. He mentions that while Lightning currently doesn't generate much data, when multiplied by 100 it becomes a significant amount. This leads to the need for people to store a substantial amount of data, which can become a bigger challenge compared to dealing with smaller amounts.

Peter also mentions the use of SIGHASH_SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY, which allows for combining multiple HTLC (Hashed Time-Lock Contract) claims into one transaction. He contrasts this with pre-signing, where individual transactions would have to be handled separately. The use of SIGHASH_SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY provides a more efficient way of handling multiple HTLC claims, reducing the number of individual transactions.

Overall, Peter raises concerns about the increasing amount of data in Lightning and the challenges it presents for storage and transaction handling. The use of SIGHASH_SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY is proposed as a solution to improve efficiency in handling multiple HTLC claims.</summary>
