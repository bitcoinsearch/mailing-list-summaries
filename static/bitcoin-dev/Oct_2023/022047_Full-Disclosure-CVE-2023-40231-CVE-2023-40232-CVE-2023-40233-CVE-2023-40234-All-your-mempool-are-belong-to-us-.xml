    <summary>In an email sent by Peter Todd to an unknown recipient, he discusses the issue of Lightning data and its potential impact on data storage for larger nodes. While acknowledging that Lightning data currently may not be significant, Todd emphasizes that when multiplied by 100, it can become a considerable amount of data. This could potentially lead to the need for storing a substantial amount of data, causing inconvenience for larger nodes.Todd then refers to the concept of SIGHASH_SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY. He explains that by utilizing this approach, multiple HTLC (Hashed Time-Locked Contract) claims can be combined into a single transaction. In contrast, pre-signing would require numerous individual transactions, resulting in a more cumbersome process.The email ends abruptly after Todd's mention of these points.</summary>
