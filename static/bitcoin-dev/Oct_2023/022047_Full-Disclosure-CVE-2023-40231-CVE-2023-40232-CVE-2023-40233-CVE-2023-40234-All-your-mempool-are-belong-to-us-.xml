    <summary>In an email sent by Peter Todd, he highlights the issue of storing a significant amount of data for larger nodes in the context of Lightning. He explains that while the current data size may not be significant, when multiplied by 100, it becomes a substantial amount of data. This poses challenges for storing and managing this data for larger nodes.

Peter suggests that using the SIGHASH_SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY feature would enable combining multiple HTLC (Hash Time Locked Contract) claims into a single transaction. This is in contrast to the alternative of pre-signing, which would result in a large number of individual transactions.

Overall, Peter's email emphasizes the increasing complexity and pain associated with managing a growing amount of data in Lightning, particularly for larger nodes. The use of the SIGHASH_SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY feature is proposed as a solution to address this challenge.</summary>
