    <summary>In an email sent by Peter Todd, he discusses the use of anchor outputs and their benefits. By removing the pre-set feerate, certain edge-cases and the fee-inflation attack can be addressed. The use of pre-signed transactions does not necessarily reintroduce these issues as long as the broadcaster has the ability to choose which transaction to broadcast, making it just another transaction for them.

However, Todd expresses doubt about the use of multiple pre-signed transactions. He mentions that this approach would result in more fee overhead and the inability to batch transactions, which can be inconvenient. Additionally, keeping track of numerous variants across different feerates could lead to overspending on fees.

Todd emphasizes that this issue is a policy bug that should be fixed at the policy/Bitcoin Core layer, rather than in the lightning world. He believes that miners may not be receiving optimal value in transaction fees due to this transaction pattern, and it needs to be addressed at a higher level.

This email provides insights into the challenges and considerations surrounding the use of anchor outputs and multiple pre-signed transactions. It highlights the need for policy adjustments and improvements within the Bitcoin Core layer to ensure efficient and cost-effective transaction processing.</summary>
