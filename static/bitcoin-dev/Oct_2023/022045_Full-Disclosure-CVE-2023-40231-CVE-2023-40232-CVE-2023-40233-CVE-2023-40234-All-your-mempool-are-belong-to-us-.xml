    <summary>In an email sent by Peter Todd, he discusses the use of anchor outputs in solving issues related to edge-cases and the fee-inflation attack. By removing the pre-set feerate, the problems can be avoided and the fee-inflation attack can be addressed. The use of pre-signed transactions does not reintroduce these issues as long as the broadcaster has the ability to choose which transaction to broadcast. However, Todd expresses skepticism towards the use of multiple pre-signed transactions due to the increased fee overhead and the difficulty of keeping track of various variants across different feerates. He believes that this is a policy bug that should be fixed at the policy/Bitcoin Core layer rather than in the lightning world. Todd emphasizes that miners may not be receiving the optimal value in transaction fees, and this issue needs to be resolved at the policy level.It is important to note that the tone of the email is critical and raises concerns about the potential overspending on fees and the resource-intensive nature of fixing this issue. Todd suggests that this problem should be addressed in the policy/Bitcoin Core layer rather than within the lightning network. The email provides insights into the challenges and considerations involved in optimizing transaction fees and highlights the need for a more efficient and effective solution at the policy level.</summary>
