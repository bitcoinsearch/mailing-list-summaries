    <summary>In an email from Peter Todd, he acknowledges a fair point about the minimal amount of work involved in a spammy chain. He also mentions that in cases where force-close is required, there tends to be a repeated failure in multiple HTLCs. However, he believes that this is not a significant change to the trust model of Lightning and that it's already possible for a peer willing to put in effort to steal money. This new method is just one more way for them to do so. There is no rush to fix this issue with Lightning; instead, it should be addressed at the ecosystem level. It is important to avoid a policy restriction that would negatively impact the L2 network and reduce miner payments, as this would be a policy bug.</summary>
