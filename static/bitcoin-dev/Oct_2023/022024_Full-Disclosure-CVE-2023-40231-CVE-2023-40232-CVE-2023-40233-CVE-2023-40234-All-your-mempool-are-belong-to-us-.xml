    <summary>In the email, the sender proposes a strategy to defend against an attacker who is attempting to replace a transaction in the Bitcoin network. The strategy involves an honest node aggressively fee-bumping and retransmitting the HTLC-timeout as the CLTV delta deadline approaches. The sender suggests that the honest node should start increasing the fee by 1/10th of the HTLC value for each non-confirmation within 10 blocks of the deadline.This approach, referred to as the "scorched earth" approach, may result in considerable fees for the honest node. However, it will cost the attacker even more, as each replacement transaction would need to burn at least as much as the HTLC-timeout fees. Additionally, the attacker would need to perform a replacement every time the honest node fee bumps.The sender believes that this fee-bumping policy will provide sufficient defense against the attacker, even if the attacker is replacement-cycling directly in miners' mempools and the victim has no visibility into the attack.The sender suggests considering this strategy as a means to protect against potential attacks on the Bitcoin network.</summary>
