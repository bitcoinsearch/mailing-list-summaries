    <summary>The email discusses a potential defense strategy against an attacker in the context of fee-bumping and retransmitting HTLC-timeout. The author suggests implementing an aggressive fee-bumping approach as the deadline for CLTV delta approaches, following the suggestion made by Ziggie. Specifically, the honest node would start increasing the fee by 1/10th of the HTLC value for each non-confirmation, within 10 blocks of the deadline.

This proposed "scorched earth" approach may result in significant fees for the honest node, but it would impose an even higher cost on the attacker. This is because each attacker replacement would need to burn at least as much as the HTLC-timeout fees, and the attacker would have to perform a replacement every time the honest node fee bumps. 

The author argues that this fee-bumping policy would provide sufficient defense, even if the attacker is engaging in replacement-cycling directly in miners' mempools and the victim has no visibility into the attack. By continuously increasing the fee, the honest node can effectively deter and counter the attacker's actions while minimizing the impact on the victim.

Overall, the email explores the idea of using an aggressive fee-bumping strategy to counter an attacker during the HTLC-timeout process, highlighting its potential benefits and effectiveness in defending against such attacks.</summary>
