    <title>Combined summary - Ordinals BIP PR</title>

    <summary>The email conversation revolves around the topic of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) and their role in the Bitcoin community. The sender expresses disagreement with the claim that BIPs are used for too many things, suggesting that SLIPs should be used for altcoin-related matters instead. They also propose merging BOLTs into BIPs but acknowledge that it would require effort and cooperation from the Lightning development community. 

There are several pull requests (PRs) that need to be triaged and merged, which are considered more important than the issue with Ordinals. The issue with Ordinals is that it is unclear if it qualifies as a BIP since it is seen as an attack on Bitcoin rather than an improvement. There is a debate on whether certain clauses in BIP 2 are relevant to this situation, and these issues need to be resolved before the PR can be merged. The sender has already given their opinion on the matter, emphasizing that ignoring the issues won't make them go away. 

Another participant in the email conversation suggests that most wallet-related protocols, such as BIP69, ypubs, and zpubs, might not qualify as BIPs. They propose using the SLIP repository as an alternative spec repository for these protocols. However, they express dissatisfaction with this situation and even humorously mention that they would prefer OpenTimestamps to be a BIP. They point out that the Lightning Network (LN) has its own spec repository due to its size, and although BIPs technically require approval from Core maintainers to be merged, this approval should be automatic according to BIP 2. 

A different participant raises questions about the evaluation process of BIPs, such as who is in charge and how to predict if a proposal will become a widespread standard. They also question the core mission of Bitcoin and how to measure if something aligns with that mission. They emphasize the need to define the entire Bitcoin community before evaluating proposals. 

Another participant expresses their opinion that BIPs should be limited to extremely widespread standards used by the entire Bitcoin community for the core mission of Bitcoin. They argue that many things have been assigned as BIPs unnecessarily and suggest that Lightning Network, although arguably deserving of BIPs, doesn't require approval from Core maintainers due to its separate BOLT process. 

Yet another participant criticizes a specific BIP and suggests that it brings no improvement and is actually a regression. They encourage the sender to retract the BIP or create an alternative proposal that wouldn't negatively affect the Bitcoin chain. 

One participant agrees with the sender and believes that evaluating BIPs based on implementation merits or network consequences sets a bad precedent. They argue that actual consensus goes beyond the BIPs repository and that interpreting BIP numbers as indicating endorsement by influential individuals can cause problems. 

In conclusion, the sender of the email expresses frustration over the Ordinals BIP PR being open for nine months without any response from the BIP editors. They seek clarification on whether the PR is in-scope for a BIP and what changes are needed for it to be accepted. They highlight that BIP acceptance does not guarantee inclusion in any implementation or consensus among the community.</summary>
