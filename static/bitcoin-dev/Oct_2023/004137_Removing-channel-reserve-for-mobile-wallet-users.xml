    <summary>In this email, Tony Giorgio raises some questions and concerns regarding the proposal made by Bastien. Tony acknowledges Bastien's acknowledgment (ACK) on a certain matter but questions the need for it, pointing out that wallets and LSPs (Lightning Service Providers) already have the option to provide the user experience (UX) being discussed. Tony seeks clarification on whether Bastien is proposing a network-wide switch away from reserves or if it only applies to mobile wallets and LSPs that choose to opt in.

Tony also brings up the topic of the dust reserve limit, seeking further information on how it will be affected. He mentions that, based on his understanding, all node implementations currently allow for the removal of the 1% reserve requirement but still maintain the dust reserve.

Overall, Tony's email raises important points and seeks clarification on various aspects of the proposal.</summary>
