    <summary>In a recent email, James raised a question regarding the use of the SHA256 hash in a snapshot file. He suggested that instead of hashing the snapshot file separately, why not use the hash of the file itself as the canonical hash? This approach, according to James, would eliminate any malleability issues. James pointed out that the function "gettxoutsetinfo" already requires walking through the entire UTXO set to calculate the hash. Therefore, it would be more efficient to have this function generate the actual contents of the dump file and calculate the hash of it. He argued that this implementation approach is straightforward and logical.To support his argument, James included a link to Peter Todd's website (https://petertodd.org). However, the content of the linked resource was not provided in the email.It is important to note that the farewell part of the email was disregarded for the purpose of this summary.</summary>
