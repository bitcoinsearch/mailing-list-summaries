    <summary>The email suggests applying the concept of presigned fee multiplier to HTLC (Hashed Time-Locked Contract) spends in order to prevent replacement cycling attacks. It proposes modifying HTLC scripts so that both parties involved can only spend the HTLC through presigned second-stage transactions, which are always signed with SIGHASH_ALL. By doing so, the attacker would be unable to add inputs to their presigned transaction, making a replacement cycling attack impossible. However, this approach would require more bookkeeping and result in less fee granularity when claiming HTLCs on the blockchain.</summary>
