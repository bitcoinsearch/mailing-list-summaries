    <summary>The email suggests applying the concept of a presigned fee multiplier to prevent replacement cycling attacks in HTLC spends. The proposed solution involves modifying HTLC scripts so that both parties can only spend the HTLC via presigned second-stage transactions, which are always signed with SIGHASH_ALL. By doing so, the attacker is prevented from adding inputs to their presigned transaction, thus making a replacement cycling attack impossible. However, implementing this solution would require more bookkeeping and result in less fee granularity when claiming HTLCs on chain.</summary>
