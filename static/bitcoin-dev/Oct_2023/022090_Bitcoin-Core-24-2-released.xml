    <summary>Bitcoin Core version v24.2 is now available for download. This release includes bug fixes, performance improvements, and updated translations. Users are encouraged to report any bugs using the issue tracker on GitHub.

To upgrade to the latest version, users should shut down their current version and then run the installer on Windows or copy over the appropriate files on macOS and Linux. Upgrading from older versions of Bitcoin Core may take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated, but it is generally supported.

Bitcoin Core is extensively tested and supported on Linux, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer. While it should also work on other Unix-like systems, it is not as frequently tested on them. Unsupported systems are not recommended for use with Bitcoin Core.

Some specific updates in this release include improvements in fee estimation to avoid serving stale fee estimates, a fix for invalid bech32 address handling in RPC and other APIs, and fixes related to the build system. The complete list of changes can be found in the release notes.

The release also credits several individuals who directly contributed to this release, including Abubakar Sadiq Ismail, Hennadii Stepanov, Marco Falke, Michael Ford, and Pieter Wuille.
