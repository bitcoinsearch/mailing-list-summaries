    <summary>Bitcoin Core v25.1 with Antoine Riard's full-rbf peering code is available on GitHub. This version includes some minor updates as well. The purpose of this version is to advertise a FULL_RBF service bit when mempoolfullrbf=1 is set and to connect to four additional FULL_RBF peers. These changes ensure that a core group of nodes are reliably propagating full-rbf replacements. It is not necessary for everyone to run this version, but it would be helpful if more people did. 

Running full-rbf has its advantages, which are discussed in a blog post by Peter Todd: "Why You Should Run mempoolfullrbf." Currently, at least 31% of hash power from at least 4 mining pools is dedicated to mining full-RBF.
