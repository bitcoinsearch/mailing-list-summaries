    <summary>Schnorr signatures, which are 64 bytes in size, have the advantage over other signature types such as RBF (Replace-By-Fee) and CPFP (Child Pays For Parent) when it comes to efficiency and transaction form determinism. In scenarios like lightning where transactions are derived deterministically, signing 100 extra transactions only requires an additional 6400 bytes. Even with a slow connection speed of 100KB/s, this can be transferred in just 64ms, with latency being the dominant factor.

RBF, by default, has a minimum incremental relay fee of 1sat/vByte. By utilizing the 100 pre-signed transaction variants to sign every possible minimum incremental relay, a range of 1sat/vByte to 100sat/vByte can be covered. This range is believed to be sufficient for mining any block in Bitcoin's entire modern history. On the other hand, CPFP requires two transactions and therefore involves extra bytes. Unless dealing with very large transactions in low-fee environments, there is no circumstance where CPFP outperforms RBF.
