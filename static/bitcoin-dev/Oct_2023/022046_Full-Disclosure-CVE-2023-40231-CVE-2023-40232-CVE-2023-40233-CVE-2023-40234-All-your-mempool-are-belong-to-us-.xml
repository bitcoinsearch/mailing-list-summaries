    <summary>Schnorr signatures, which are 64 bytes in size, can be advantageous in situations like lightning where the transaction form is deterministically derived. For example, signing 100 extra transactions would only require an additional 6400 bytes. Even with a slow connection speed of 100KB/s, transferring this amount of data would take just 64ms. It is important to note that latency will still dominate in such cases.Regarding Replace-By-Fee (RBF), it has a default minimum incremental relay fee of 1sat/vByte. By utilizing the 100 pre-signed transaction variants, one can cover a range of 1sat/vByte to 100sat/vByte by simply signing every possible minimum incremental relay. This range is believed to be sufficient for getting mined in any block throughout Bitcoin's modern history.On the other hand, Child-Pays-for-Parent (CPFP) requires two transactions, which means additional bytes. Unless dealing with very large transactions in low-fee environments, there is no circumstance where CPFP surpasses RBF.For more information on this topic, you can visit Peter Todd's website at https://petertodd.org or contact him at 'peter'[:-1]@petertodd.org.</summary>
