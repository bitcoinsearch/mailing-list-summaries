    <summary>Adding another editor may not solve the problem discussed in the thread. In a previous similar situation, Kalle was added as an editor instead of decentralizing the BIP process. The concern is that BIP editors can have personal opinions and biases that may affect the merging of PRs, rendering the repository useless for many developers. Some users argue that certain proposals, such as drivechain or BIP 47, are attacks on Bitcoin, while others find controversial the use of OP_RETURN in colored coins or the idea of increasing blocksize. However, these BIPs still exist in the same repository. 

There is a suggestion to remove terms like "philosophy" and "net improvement" from BIP 2, as they can be interpreted differently by different people. It is important to consider that some users want to use their money in alternative ways, similar to taproot assets and other standards aimed at achieving similar goals.
