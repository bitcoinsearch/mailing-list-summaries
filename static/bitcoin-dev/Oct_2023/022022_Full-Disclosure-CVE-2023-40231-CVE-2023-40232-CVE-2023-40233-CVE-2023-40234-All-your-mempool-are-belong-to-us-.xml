    <summary>In the email, Antoine is thanked for their work on an issue. The sender confirms that Eclair v0.9.0 includes the described mitigations. It is mentioned that Eclair has been monitoring the mempool for preimages since its early versions, relying on Bitcoin Core's ZMQ notifications for incoming transactions. This ensures that the HTLC success transaction can be seen, even if it is immediately replaced, as long as the ZMQ limits are not exceeded. However, it is agreed with Matt that more fundamental work needs to be done at the bitcoin layer to enhance the robustness of L2 protocols against this type of attacks. The email concludes with thanks from Bastien.</summary>
