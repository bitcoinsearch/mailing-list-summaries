    <summary>Antoine's work on the issue has been appreciated and it is confirmed that eclair v0.9.0 includes the mentioned mitigations. Eclair has been monitoring the mempool for preimages since its early versions, using Bitcoin Core's ZMQ notifications for incoming transactions. This ensures the visibility of the HTLC success transaction, even if it is quickly replaced, as long as the ZMQ limits are not exceeded. However, Matt suggests that further fundamental work should be carried out at the bitcoin layer to enhance the resilience of L2 protocols against such attacks. Thanks, Bastien.</summary>
