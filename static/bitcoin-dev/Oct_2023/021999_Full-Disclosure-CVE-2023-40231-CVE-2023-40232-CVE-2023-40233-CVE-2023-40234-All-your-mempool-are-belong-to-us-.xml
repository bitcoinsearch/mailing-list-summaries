    <summary>A new attack on lightning channels called a transaction-relay jamming attack has been discovered. This attack poses security risks as it exposes lightning routing hops to loss of funds. Major lightning implementations such as LDK, Eclair, LND, and Core-Lightning have designed and deployed mitigations to address this attack. The attack involves a replacement cycling attack where a malicious channel counterparty broadcasts its HTLC-preimage transaction with a higher fee and triggers a replacement. Various measures have been implemented to mitigate this attack, including aggressive rebroadcasting, local-mempool preimage monitoring, and bumping the default CLTV delta. These mitigations have been deployed by Eclair, Core-Lightning, LND, and LDK. It is important for developers, maintainers, and operators of bitcoin applications using timelocks or multi-party transactions to investigate how replacement cycling attacks might disrupt their transactions. There is also an open problem regarding package malleability pinning attacks, and further investigation is needed to address this issue. The full disclosure of the attack and assigned CVEs occurred on October 16, 2023. Mitigations have been implemented to address the replacement cycling attack affecting lightning channels, but further investigation is needed to ensure the security of other bitcoin applications.</summary>
