    <summary>In the email, the sender expresses their support for introducing the 0-channel reserve option into the protocol. They suggest adding it via a Blip and mention that it would be useful to have the option to open zero-reserve channels. They also propose restricting this feature through a channel interceptor. The sender suggests including information on how to prove possible cheating attacks in the spec/blip. They ask if the recipient has already reported the issue.</summary>
