    <summary>Ziggie has requested Bastien to open a pull request (PR) to the bLIP repository. It is unclear what the statement "it doesn't work currently without it" refers to. There is a question regarding whether this is an issue specific to the implementation. Bastien suggests that if the channel reserve is removed, then there would be no need to consider the dust limit.</summary>
