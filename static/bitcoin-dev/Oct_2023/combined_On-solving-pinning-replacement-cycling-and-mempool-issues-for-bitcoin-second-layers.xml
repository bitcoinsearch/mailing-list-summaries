    <summary>Gleb Naumenko and the sender of the email have expressed their intention to allocate their research time towards finding a sustainable fix for the lightning network. They aim to address various issues such as pinnings, replacement cycling attacks, mempool issues, and force-closure beyond available blockspace. Both individuals have previously studied these cross-layer issues together, gaining practical experience with bitcoin core and rust-lightning codebases [0] [1]. Additionally, they plan to involve Elichai Turkel in order to verify the mathematical aspects and risk models associated with the proposed fixes.

The main objective of implementing these sustainable fixes is to reduce the fee-bumping reserve value and the number of UTXOs that lightning users need to continuously lock in order to utilize the 24/7 payment system worldwide. To tackle security concerns within the Lightning Network ecosystem, the sender has reopened an issue on coordinated security issue handling [2].

While the sender will primarily focus on solving the aforementioned problems at the base-layer, they also express their intention to remain involved with younger LN developers for a few months. However, it should be noted that there is currently no well-defined solution design, code, conceptual draft, or paper available. The sender emphasizes the importance of carefully considering game theory and changes to nodes network processing resources, all while adhering to the existing open and responsible Bitcoin process.

The sender acknowledges that this undertaking will require a reasonable amount of time, similar to the package relay design discussions that began in 2018 and are now progressing to the implementation and review phase. They eagerly anticipate receiving feedback and thoughts from both the Bitcoin and Lightning development protocols community [3].

In summary, Gleb Naumenko and the sender plan to dedicate their research time towards finding sustainable fixes for the lightning network. They have identified multiple issues and aim to reduce fees while improving the overall user experience. They actively seek input and engagement from the Bitcoin and Lightning development community.
