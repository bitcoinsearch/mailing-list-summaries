    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Natanael brought up the issue of circumventing rules by colluding parties involved in signing transactions for funds held in a P2SH address. Even if the original intent was to hold the fund accountable through enforced script rules, collusion could break the purpose of the fund. The response from another member of the mailing list pointed out that graftroot would mean funds were paid to a public key and could be signed without constraint, rendering accountability non-existent regardless of graftroot. It's possible that Natanael's example was only meant to argue for the possibility of sending funds constrained by a script without a public key ever existing at all, which the responder agreed with but noted was not the topic at hand.</summary>
