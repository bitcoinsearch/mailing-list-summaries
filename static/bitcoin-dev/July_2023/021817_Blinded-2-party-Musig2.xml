    <summary>In a discussion thread, Tom Trevethan raised the question of whether proving knowledge of the r values (ephemeral keys) used in generating each R could prevent the Wagner attack. However, Jonas Nick responded that none of the attacks mentioned so far, including attacks on nonces and challenges, can be prevented by proving knowledge of the signing key (proof of possession, PoP). It is important to note that no further information or context is provided in the given excerpt. Therefore, it is not possible to generate a detailed summary beyond the information provided in the text.</summary>
