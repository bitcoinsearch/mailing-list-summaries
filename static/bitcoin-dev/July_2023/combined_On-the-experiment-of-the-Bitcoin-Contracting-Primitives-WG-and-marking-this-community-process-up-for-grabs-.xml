    <summary>Last year, a new community process was introduced to specify covenants in response to the failure of the CTV speedy trial activation and discussions about covenant proposals. The goals of this process were to establish a consistent framework for evaluating covenant proposals, explore common grounds between proposals, expand the consensus changes development process beyond Bitcoin Core, and maintain a high-quality technical archive.To address issues in consensus development changes, initiatives such as the bitcoin-inquisition fork and the archiving of all covenant proposals under the Optech umbrella were undertaken. Additionally, the Bitcoin Contracting Primitives Working Group was formed to document and archive various primitives and protocols related to advanced contracts. Monthly meetings were held with participants from different parts of the community, engaging in detailed discussions on topics like "merkelized all the things" and "payment pools for miners payoffs."While the initial experiment showed promise, the author of the post decided not to actively pursue the process further due to commitments in Lightning development. They emphasized the importance of ensuring the smooth operation and scalability of the Lightning Network, considering it more critical for Bitcoin's survival than extended covenant capabilities. However, they encouraged others working on covenant changes proposals to continue their efforts and highlighted the positive impact of soft forks like Taproot and Schnorr on self-custody solutions.Moving forward, the author plans to focus on research and development work on CoinPool, addressing issues such as interactivity and withdrawal compression. They also mentioned the possibility of submitting security reviews of consensus changes under pseudonyms. While acknowledging that they may have overpromised with the kickstart of the new process, the author recognized the value of the working group sessions and the technical interests expressed by participants.The author believes that Bitcoin has compelling technical proposals to advance the capabilities of Bitcoin Script today. However, they argue that what is lacking is a small group of technical historians and archivists to assess, collect, and preserve consensus changes proposals, as well as quality assurance developers to ensure thorough testing before deployment. They invited others to take on the maintenance and nurturing of the Bitcoin Contracting Primitives WG or collaborate with Optech on industry-wise workshops on covenants.In conclusion, the author acknowledged their personal bias towards Lightning development but expressed their belief in the potential of the community to drive forward technical advancements for Bitcoin. They encouraged individuals with proof-of-work and long-term commitment to reach out to continue the work on consensus changes and emphasized the need for rigorous testing and adherence to decentralization and FOSS neutrality standards.</summary>
