    <summary>In a recent update on the Bitcoin Contracting Primitives Working Group (WG), Antoine Riard announced that he will no longer actively pursue the maintenance of the group. The WG was established to evaluate covenant proposals and open up the consensus changes development process beyond Bitcoin Core. Riard acknowledged that his focus on Lightning Network (LN) development has limited his ability to dedicate time to the WG, but emphasized the importance of LN for Bitcoin's survival.While Riard believes that Bitcoin does not lack compelling technical proposals, he highlighted the need for technical historians and archivists to assess and preserve consensus change proposals. He also mentioned the importance of QA developers to ensure thorough testing before deployment. Riard plans to continue his work on CoinPool, focusing on interactivity issues and advanced Bitcoin contracts based on the taproot annex. He also expressed the possibility of submitting an in-depth security review of consensus changes under pseudonyms.Riard encouraged others interested in maintaining and nurturing the Bitcoin Contracting Primitives WG or collaborating with Optech to reach out. He provided links to past emails and GitHub pull requests related to Bitcoin development. He expressed his openness to opportunities to work full-time on consensus changes if operational ground, legal information, or financial resources are available.Keagan McClelland expressed his perspective that covenant schemes can contribute significantly to the maturity of the Lightning Network. He argued that covenants are necessary for Bitcoin's long-term survival and challenged the idea that they are a distraction from LN development.Overall, Riard's announcement provides an update on the progress of the community process to specify covenants and emphasizes the importance of the Lightning Network. He invites others to continue the work on covenants and offers support to those committed to long-term efforts in this area.In the context provided, the author shares their experiences and interactions with different organizations that have shown interest in supporting the development of softforks and covenants in the Bitcoin space. The author mentions engaging with R&amp;D non-profits, individual investors, and venture capital firms, all of whom are interested in providing resources to advance these consensus changes.According to the author, individuals with a proven track record and reliability are more likely to receive full-time opportunities to work on such consensus changes. This suggests that having a track record of successful contributions in the Bitcoin space can increase the chances of securing employment in this field.To further delve into the topic and stay updated on developments, the author invites readers to join the bitcoin-dev mailing list. More information about the mailing list can be found at the following link: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev.By actively engaging with various organizations and fostering collaborations, the author highlights the potential for advancements in softforks and covenants within the Bitcoin community.</summary>
