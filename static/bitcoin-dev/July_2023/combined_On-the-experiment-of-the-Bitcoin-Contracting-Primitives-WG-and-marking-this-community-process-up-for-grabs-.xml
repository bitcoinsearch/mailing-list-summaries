    <summary>In a recent email thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Antoine Riard provided an update on the progress of the Bitcoin Contracting Primitives Working Group (WG). The WG aimed to create a consistent framework for evaluating covenant proposals and expand the consensus changes development process beyond Bitcoin Core. They had monthly meetings with over 20 attendees and engaged in in-depth discussions on contracting primitives. However, Antoine announced that he would not actively pursue the WG further due to his focus on Lightning Network (LN) development. He emphasized the critical importance of LN's smooth functioning and scalability for Bitcoin's survival and expressed his commitment to dedicating his time and energy to LN projects. Antoine also mentioned the potential benefits of covenant primitives for LN's maturity and encouraged others to continue working on covenant changes proposals. Keagan McClelland responded to Antoine's post by sharing his perspective on the complexity of Lightning Network proposals and the potential simplification that covenant-based solutions, such as CheckTemplateVerify (CTV), could bring. He agreed with Antoine's point that a smooth functioning LN is crucial but also highlighted the value of advanced contracting capabilities that covenant schemes like CTV can offer. Keagan acknowledged the need for further evaluation and prioritization of covenant primitives but stressed their potential benefits for Lightning.Antoine's original post introduced the idea of a new community process to specify covenants and outlined the goals of the WG, including creating a technical archive of covenant proposals and opening up the consensus changes development process. He mentioned other complementary initiatives, such as the bitcoin-inquisition fork and the archiving of covenant proposals under the Optech umbrella. Antoine reflected on the progress of the WG, noting fruitful discussions but his inability to dedicate much time to it recently due to his focus on Lightning development. He expressed his intention to continue working on LN projects and pursuing his own research and development efforts. Antoine also emphasized the importance of maintaining a strong technical archive and thorough testing of consensus change proposals before deployment.In a separate message, Antoine Riard announced his resignation from Blockstream to focus on Taproot development. He expressed gratitude for the opportunity to contribute to the project and highlighted his work on Taproot. He mentioned that he would continue providing support for Taproot implementation and encouraged others to reach out for assistance. Riard also shared updates on his ongoing projects, mentioning the pending release of version 0.2 of the CoinPool whitepaper and recommending reading Foucault's essay "Le philosophe masque" for philosophical insights into his decision-making process.Regarding consensus changes, Riard stated his belief in collective product management rather than relying on a single individual or a small group of elite developers. He emphasized the importance of collaboration and suggested that even simple consensus changes require input from a diverse range of contributors. Riard concluded by mentioning the interest and offers he has received from various organizations and individuals to support his work on softforks and covenants in the Bitcoin space. He encouraged those with long-term plans and resources to reach out for potential collaborations. Overall, Riard's message reflects his commitment to continuing his work on Taproot and his belief in the power of collaboration and community involvement in consensus changes within the Bitcoin ecosystem.</summary>
