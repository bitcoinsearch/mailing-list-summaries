    <summary>Last year, a new community process was introduced to specify covenants in response to the failure of the CTV speedy trial activation and discussions about covenant proposals. The goals of this process were to evaluate covenant proposals, explore common grounds, open up consensus changes development, and maintain a technical archive. Initiatives like the bitcoin-inquisition fork and archiving covenant proposals under Optech were undertaken.The Bitcoin Contracting Primitives Working Group was established to document and archive advanced contract primitives and protocols. Monthly meetings were held with participants from various parts of the community, discussing topics like "merkelized all the things" and "payment pools for miners payoffs." However, the author of the post decided not to actively pursue the process further due to commitments in Lightning development.Although the author believes that ensuring the smooth operation and scalability of the Lightning Network is more critical for Bitcoin's survival, they encourage others to continue working on covenant proposals. They highlight the positive impact of soft forks like Taproot and Schnorr on self-custody solutions. Moving forward, the author plans to focus on CoinPool development, addressing interactivity issues and withdrawal compression.The author acknowledges the need for technical historians and archivists to assess and preserve consensus change proposals. They invite interested individuals to maintain and nurture the Bitcoin Contracting Primitives WG or collaborate with Optech on covenant workshops. The author emphasizes the importance of proof-of-work, long-term commitment, and available resources to drive these efforts forward and advance the capabilities of Bitcoin Script.</summary>
