    <summary>Some people do not consider Ordinals as spam, and blocking them could be seen as censorship. There are concerns that blocking Ordinals could lead to blocking regular transactions based on other criteria in the future. Even if developers create an official version with the option to block Ordinals, some people may choose not to follow it or even block Ordinals-filtering nodes. There are pages with images, files, and other data pushed on-chain before Ordinals. The whole whitepaper was uploaded on a multisig output. Altcoins use part of Bitcoin's UTXO set as their database. Solving the IBD problem and UTXO set growing problem is essential. If Ordinals are blocked specifically, people may interpret it as using the old way instead. To block all possible ways, new nodes without synchronizing non-consensus data would need to be created. Taproot can still be used to upload data by turning off the witness and becoming a pre-SegWit node. Blocking these methods would require more code to strip data correctly from legacy parts. Data will be pushed by mining pools without a soft fork. Adding settings won't help much as most people use the default configuration. A patch by Luke Dashjr does not address all cases, and spammers can easily bypass restrictions. Inscription should be addressed, as not taking action could encourage more spam attacks in the future. The proposal does not involve implementing a soft fork but adding a standardization option for the community to decide whether to activate it or not.</summary>
