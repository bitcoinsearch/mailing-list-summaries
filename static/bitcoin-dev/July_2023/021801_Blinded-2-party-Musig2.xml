    <summary>It seems that Jonas is expressing his concerns about a missing blinding step in the process. He suggests that if the server (referred to as party 1) receives a value c during the signature protocol, it could potentially scan the blockchain for signatures and compute corresponding hashes c' using the verification process. By comparing c with c', the server would be able to obtain the preimage for the received c, including the value m.To address this issue, there would need to be a method for blinding the value of c. This means that for every transaction, the server would compute c from the on-chain data and then match it to the corresponding m (transaction). By blinding the value of c, the server would not be able to determine the final value of (R,s1+s2) or m.It's important to note that the email thread mentioning these concerns is dated July 24, 2023, and it appears to be a discussion between Jonas and another individual named Party 1. The context also includes an HTML attachment that has been scrubbed, so its content is not available.This discussion highlights the potential vulnerability in the system and the need for a blinding step to ensure the security and privacy of the transaction data. It raises questions about how the server can verify the correctness of the received c without being able to obtain the underlying m value.</summary>
