    <summary>The issue at hand is the spam attack caused by inscriptions in the Bitcoin network. Unlike other methods of spamming, inscriptions have the ability to embed themselves in the witness and reduce fees. While the standardization rule limiting op_return to 80 bytes has prevented similar abuses, inscriptions remain a significant problem.Taking action against the use of inscriptions could prevent more serious issues, as it would be seen as a rejection of this kind of behavior. However, not taking action could be interpreted as tacit acceptance and may encourage further spam attacks in the future.It is important to note that the proposed solution does not involve implementing a soft fork. Instead, it suggests considering the addition of a standardization option. This would allow the community to decide whether to activate it or not.The lack of available options to reject inscriptions in the mempool of a node is due to the complexity of the problem they present. Blocking one type of inscription would simply lead to the creation of different ones. Additionally, inscriptions are now present even on chains without Taproot or Segwit, further complicating the issue.Inscriptions are primarily used to sell NFTs or Tokens, concepts that the Bitcoin community has consistently rejected. However, it is worth noting that the community has also rejected concepts like sidechains, yet they still exist in a more centralized form.Overall, addressing the spam attack caused by inscriptions requires careful consideration and a solution that takes into account the potential consequences and implications for the Bitcoin network.</summary>
