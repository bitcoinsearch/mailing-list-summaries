    <summary>The email discusses an interesting protocol idea that involves incorporating a two-factor authentication (2FA) process. The purpose of the blind-signing server in this protocol is solely to verify the 2FA. Unlike typical uses of blind signing where the number of signatures matters, this protocol focuses on authorizing individuals through the 2FA procedure rather than counting signatures. However, the email points out a potential vulnerability in the protocol regarding K values and possible attacks. The link to the gist containing more details about the protocol is provided: https://gist.github.com/moonsettler/05f5948291ba8dba63a3985b786233bb. The email was sent using Proton Mail secure email.</summary>
