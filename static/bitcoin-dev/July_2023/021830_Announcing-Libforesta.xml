    <summary>Davidson, an individual who has been developing a project called Floresta, is excited to share `libfloresta` with the Bitcoin devs mailing list. `libfloresta` is a derivative of the Floresta project, which is a Fully-Validating Bitcoin Full node powered by Utreexo. It includes an integrated watch-only wallet and Electrum Server. The aim of `libfloresta` is to provide a compact, simple, and ready-to-use full node for end users, particularly on low-power devices like single-board computers (SBC) and smartphones.To make `libfloresta` easily reusable in other applications, Davidson has decided to turn it into a series of libraries. The main logic is being written in Rust, and bindings will be generated to the original code, allowing it to run virtually anywhere through WebAssembly (WASM) compilation. While the project is still in its early stage, Davidson has been using it on signet without any issues. Mainnet support is almost ready, but there are some performance issues with bridge nodes that need to be resolved before setting them up as utreexo peers. The project can be found on Davidson's GitHub repository, and he has also written an initial blogpost explaining how to use it in Rust. He plans to write more as the project matures and gets running on other platforms. Feedback from the community is welcome.In terms of consensus, Davidson clarifies that `libfloresta` does not reimplement the Bitcoin Consensus machine from scratch. Instead, he is using `libbitcoinconsensus` and intends to use the full `libbitcoinkernel` in the future. Cross-testing against Bitcoin Core is being done to identify any inconsistencies and prevent potential splits caused by misimplementations.Davidson expresses his gratitude to Vinteum for their support in his work with utreexo and Floresta.Best regards,Davidson Souza.</summary>
