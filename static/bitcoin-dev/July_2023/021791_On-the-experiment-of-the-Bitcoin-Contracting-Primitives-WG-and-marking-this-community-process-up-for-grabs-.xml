    <summary>Antoine expresses agreement with Greg's development approach regarding starting small with consensus change primitives. Antoine mentions that taproot has demonstrated a good historical process and refers to the community-wide taproot review, which served as the basis for the Bitcoin Contracting Primitives WG. However, Antoine disagrees with the idea that BOLTs (Bitcoin Operational Lightning Tool Specifications) should have authority over the running code of implementations. He believes that each BOLT should be individually judged on its technical merits. Antoine also points out that there are areas of critical Lightning operations that are not documented by the BOLTs, such as fee-bumping and transaction broadcast reactions for on-chain DLCs.Antoine raises uncertainty about the technical fitness of Simplicity for small party channels. He recalls a presentation by Russell O'connor about Simplicity and questions how it would work in a chain of transactions, particularly in the context of off-chain states that advance independently from the on-chain state between multiple counterparties. Antoine suggests that a consensus should be reached regarding the model of logic used for analyzing such distributed systems, referencing Leslie Lamport's temporal logic.Furthermore, Antoine mentions that Xavier Leroy at the College de France is actively studying the theoretical foundations of the Coq prover. Antoine suggests that the insights gained from this research may be valuable for using formal verification in Bitcoin consensus changes development. Antoine also notes that it is unknown if all the works and lessons have been translated from French to English.Source: [0] - Community-wide taproot review: https://github.com/discreetlogcontracts/dlcspecs/blob/master/Non-Interactive-Protocol.md[1] - On-chain DLCs: https://github.com/discreetlogcontracts/dlcspecs/blob/master/Non-Interactive-Protocol.md[2] - Leslie Lamport's temporal logic: Not provided</summary>
