    <summary>The email discusses the use of blind signatures in bitcoin transactions and raises questions about their purpose and implementation in the statechain protocol. It mentions the need for verifying signatures and backup transactions, as well as concerns about forged signatures and potential attacks. The email also suggests the idea of enforcing sequential blind signing to prevent Wagner's attack. Additionally, it discusses the authentication mechanism and proposes using a second non-identifying key for server authentication. The email thread includes discussions about a proposed protocol for 2FA authentication and blind signing in Bitcoin transactions, along with potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the protocol. Various attacks, including nonce attacks and attacks on the challenge c, are mentioned, highlighting the need for additional security measures. Finally, the conversation explores the code snippet provided by moonsettler and addresses concerns raised by other participants.The email discusses the effectiveness of a proposed solution that addresses the issue of blinding without modifying the aggregated public key. It is suggested that the responsibility of verifying the well-formedness of the challenge lies with the recipient of a statecoin rather than the server. To verify each signature, the receiver must retrieve the number of co-signings performed by the server (referred to as K) and verify each of the K signatures and transactions received from the sender. The receiver also has the ability to verify the correctness of each R value. However, it is noted that the proposed solution does not solve the problem of client-controlled challenge e', which allows for signature forgery. This vulnerability is not unique to MuSig(2) but also applies to original blind Schnorr signatures. Two papers are mentioned that propose alternative approaches to blind Schnorr signatures. One paper proposes a variant of blind Schnorr signatures that is secure under concurrent signing, assuming the hardness of the "mROS" problem. Another potential approach involves using commitments and a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP), although a detailed specification and security proof are lacking.The email includes a modified protocol that addresses the issue of blinding. It outlines the steps for key generation, signing, and transfer in the context of statecoin transfers. The protocol involves generating nonces, computing aggregate public keys, verifying the address of the statecoin, and updating key shares on transfer.The term "posk" is mentioned, but its exact meaning and relevance to the attack are unclear. Further investigation is needed to understand its significance. It is suggested to explore various sources, gather more information, analyze any possible links, and consult experts or individuals knowledgeable in relevant fields to decipher the meaning behind "posk" and its implications within the context of the attack.In the given email, there are two main discussions taking place. The first discussion is about a concern regarding party 1 not learning the final value of (R, s1+s2) or m. It is suggested that a blinding step might be missing in the process. To address this concern, it is proposed that the server can scan the blockchain for signatures and compute corresponding hashes c' = H(R||X||m) using signature verification. By comparing c with c', the server can determine if they are equal. If they are indeed equal, it implies that the server has the preimage for the c received from the client, including m. This additional step would allow the server to obtain the necessary information without compromising the security of the system.The second discussion revolves around the effectiveness of a proposed scheme related to blind music. The sender expresses doubts about its success, stating that blind music is still an ongoing research problem. It is argued that there may be potential vulnerabilities in the proposed scheme. One possible attack involves a malicious client obtaining K R-values from the server and manipulating them. By adding another set of R-values to the obtained values, the client could potentially compromise the security of the MuSig1 protocol. This attack could be executed if the nonce commitment round is skipped or if the message is not determined before sending the nonce.Additionally, there is a question raised by ZmnSCPxj regarding the vulnerability of the scheme to a certain attack. The question is whether the scheme would be vulnerable to an attack where party 2 creates an 'R' that allows it to perform certain attacks. The concern is based on the fact that MuSig2 requires multiple 'R' points from signatories, whereas the scheme being discussed only has one 'R' per party.Overall, the email discusses concerns about party 1 not learning certain values, proposes a solution to address this concern, raises doubts about the effectiveness of a proposed scheme related to blind music, and questions the vulnerability of the scheme to a specific attack.</summary>
