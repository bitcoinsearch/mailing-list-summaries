    <summary>In a recent email exchange between Antoine Riard and Keagan McClelland, the topic of advanced contracting capabilities in the Lightning Network was discussed. Antoine supported the claim that such capabilities can improve the Lightning Network and referred to ideas published with Gleb in 2020 about payment pools and the limitations of 2-party payment channels. The discussion also touched upon the trade-offs of hashchain covenants like CTV in terms of off-chain constructions.Antoine mentioned that while he doesn't believe Bitcoin needs covenant schemes to survive in the long term, he does acknowledge that certain covenants, particularly those improving payment pools or channel factories and self-custody solutions, increase the odds of Bitcoin's survival in terms of onboarding, transactional scaling, and "non-first-party to self-sovereign custody" solutions. However, he noted that proving the formal necessity of covenants would require reducing Bitcoin to a workable game theory and defining the game based on practical assumptions.Regarding the potential benefit of a covenant primitive for the current state of the Lightning Network, Antoine stated that it's hard to evaluate due to ongoing changes in channel operations from taproot, schnorr, and package relay. However, he pointed out that "high-level" Lightning is more isolated from these changes and could potentially benefit from covenant primitives. He mentioned the limitations of signatures compared to CTV-like "hash-chain" in financial engineering expressivity over a wide outcome space.Keagan expressed agreement with the idea that a smooth functioning Lightning Network is of greater importance than advanced contracting capabilities but also acknowledged that certain complex aspects of current Lightning proposals could be addressed with covenant schemes like CTV. Keagan suspected that other covenant schemes may also have similar capabilities. He emphasized that covenants should not be seen as a distraction from Lightning development, as they can significantly contribute to LN's maturity and that Lightning would almost certainly benefit from having a covenant primitive.In another email thread, Antoine discussed the Bitcoin Contracting Primitives Working Group (WG) and its goals. The WG aimed to build a consistent framework to evaluate covenant proposals, find common grounds between proposals, open up consensus changes development beyond Bitcoin Core, and maintain a high-quality technical archive. Antoine mentioned other complementary initiatives, such as the bitcoin-inquisition fork by AJ and the archiving of all covenant proposals under the Optech umbrella by Dave Harding.Antoine provided an overview of the progress made in the Bitcoin Contracting Primitives WG, including monthly meetings, discussions on the repository and chat channel, and debates on topics like "merkelized all the things" and "payment pools for miners payoffs". However, due to time constraints and prioritizing Lightning robustness, Antoine hadn't been able to run online meetings since April but had fruitful technical discussions with others involved in the effort.Antoine concluded that, in terms of Bitcoin's technological momentum, he believes the smooth functioning of the Lightning Network with a large number of UTXO-sharing users is more critical for Bitcoin's survival than extended covenant capabilities for advanced contracts. He expressed his intention to dedicate his time and energy towards working on Lightning robustness and pursuing R&amp;D works on CoinPool, among other activities related to Lightning development. Antoine acknowledged that he may have overpromised with the kickstart of the process for specifying covenants but emphasized the value of the working group's sessions and technical interests collected. He stated that Bitcoin doesn't lack compelling technical proposals but could benefit from a small group of technical historians and archivists to assess, collect, and preserve consensus change proposals, as well as QA devs to ensure thorough testing before deployment. Antoine invited anyone interested in continuing the maintenance and nurturing of the Bitcoin Contracting Primitives WG or collaborating with other initiatives to reach out to him.Overall, the email exchange between Antoine and Keagan focused on the potential benefits of covenant schemes for the Lightning Network, the importance of a smooth functioning Lightning Network, and the progress and future of the Bitcoin Contracting Primitives WG.In a recent email thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, a user named Antoine Riard discussed various topics related to Bitcoin development. The email included several links to previous discussions and resources for further reading.One of the links pointed to a previous email from September 2022, where Riard mentioned a pending whitepaper version 0.2 of CoinPool. This version aimed to address some of the remaining "Big Problems" and was delayed due to operational issues caused by the conflict in Ukraine.Another link directed readers to a pull request on GitHub related to the BitcoinOps website. The pull request (PR) was numbered 806 and likely contained updates or changes to the website's content.Riard also referenced a previous email from February 2020, which discussed philosophical reasons for certain actions. He urged readers to read Michel Foucault's essay "Le philosophe masque" to gain insights into these reasons.Furthermore, Riard expressed agreement with Jeremy's thesis, which stated that</summary>
