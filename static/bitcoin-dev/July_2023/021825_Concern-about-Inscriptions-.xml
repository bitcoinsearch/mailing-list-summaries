    <summary>The introduction of rules of standardization in Bitcoin was aimed at addressing certain issues. Although these rules can be bypassed by miners, it is uncommon to see such instances. The reason behind this is that it is easier for defenders of Bitcoin to detect and establish these transactions as standardization rules rather than creating new types of spam transactions. While the default policy may have its weaknesses, it also has strengths. When a patch is integrated into Bitcoin Core and activated by default, its effectiveness increases as more nodes update. Using a pre-segwit node is not a solution as it cannot initiate new nodes, which poses a significant problem. Satoshi himself discussed spam in a forum post, the link to which is provided here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=195.msg1617msg1617.</summary>
