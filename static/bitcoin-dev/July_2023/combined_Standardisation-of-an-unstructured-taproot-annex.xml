    <summary>Transaction: In a bitcoin-dev thread on June 2, 2023, Joost Jager proposed making the taproot annex available in a non-structured form. This approach allows developers to immediately utilize the taproot annex without waiting for a structured format. The proposal suggests that any annex starting with '0' can be considered free-form, enabling easy integration of unstructured data. This approach may require fewer bytes compared to a TLV format, which would involve encoding length even for single fields. By adopting this non-structured approach, the taproot annex can be used right away, while still leaving open the possibility of transitioning to a more structured format in the future.The discussion also touched upon the potential utilization of the annex data with LN-Symmetry, dependent on a soft fork of SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT. Joost explained that the taproot annex could facilitate putting arbitrary data into a witness without committing to it beforehand. However, the efficiency gain from this method would only be around 0.4% for witness stuffing scenarios like ordinal inscriptions.Greg Sanders shared his draft for ln-symmetry and referenced the recent discussions surrounding the taproot annex. One concern raised was the lack of coverage of other inputs' annex fields by BIP341/342 signature hashes, which could lead to malicious parties creating maximum-sized transaction packages. Possible solutions were suggested, including limiting annex usage or requiring all inputs to commit to an annex to be relay-standard.Dave Harding inquired about the current features and benefits of using the annex. Joost emphasized the benefits of making the annex available in a non-structured form, while Greg expressed interest in using annex data with LN-Symmetry but noted that it would require a soft fork of SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT. The conversation highlighted the need to find effective solutions for annex malleability without limiting its utilization.The email exchange between David and Joost touched on the features and benefits of Bitcoin, specifically regarding annex data with LN-Symmetry and the required soft fork of SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT. The efficiency gain in the reveal transaction witness was mentioned, along with the elimination of the need for a commitment transaction. This allows for including data within a single transaction relying on its own transaction identifier (txid), which is made possible by the txid calculation not incorporating the annex. The emulation of covenants through presigned transactions involving an ephemeral signer was presented as a use case for this feature.Greg and Joost engaged in a discussion about annex malleability vector, focusing on the fact that BIP341/342 signature hashes do not cover other inputs' annex fields. Proposed solutions included restricting annex usage or imposing size limitations. However, it was pointed out that these measures might not align with economic incentives and could transfer responsibility to miners without ensuring alignment with broader network health. Permitting the utilization of the annex without restrictions, while informing developers about the risks involved, was suggested as a more prudent approach.Joost and Greg discussed the use of annex in LN-Symmetry, specifically regarding the publication of a missing control block piece for the new taproot output. The annex trick was mentioned as a means to achieve this while maintaining O(1) state and 0.5RTT channel updates. The conversation also explored alternative methods, such as replacing the annex with a dangling OP_RETURN. However, this approach has limitations in terms of which sighashes can be used due to disallowing SIGHASH_SINGLE when committing to multiple outputs. The issue of malleability vector was raised, where a counter-party could submit a transaction that bloats its weight without adding fees, leading to denial of entry into the mempool. The conversation highlighted the importance of bridging the gap between node anti-DoS measures and an entity's ability to pay miners more via feerate-ordered queue. It was acknowledged that Bitcoin might not be ideally suited for certain applications in its present state.The issue of annex malleability and its impact on time-locked vaults was raised by Joost Jager. He suggested backing up ephemeral signatures on the blockchain to ensure their opening, but noted that without an annex, there is a circular reference problem which makes this process less secure. Dave Harding proposed a scriptpath solution and another solution using a decentralized protocol that allows anyone who can prove ownership of a UTXO to store some data, without putting any on the chain.Overall, the email exchanges highlight the potential benefits and challenges associated with the adoption of a taproot annex design for unstructured data storage and utilization in various use cases. The discussions also address concerns regarding annex malleability, network health, and economic incentives.</summary>
