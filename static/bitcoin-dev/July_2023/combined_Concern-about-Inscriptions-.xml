    <summary>Dear users,I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you about a crucial update regarding the integrity of our network.As you may be aware, the mempool plays a significant role in the functioning of our system.

These inscriptions are not only unnecessary but also potentially harmful.Therefore, we kindly request all users to reject such inscriptions in order to protect the integrity of our network. To ensure the effectiveness of this measure, we would like to emphasize the importance of your attention to this matter.By actively identifying and rejecting inscriptions in the mempool, you will contribute to maintaining the reliability and smooth operation of our network.In order to assist you in this process, we have provided a set of user-friendly tools and resources. These tools will enable you to easily identify and reject any suspicious or unnecessary inscriptions in the mempool. We highly encourage you to familiarize yourself with these resources and make use of them to safeguard the integrity of our network.Your cooperation in this regard is greatly appreciated. Together, we can create a secure environment for all users and ensure the continued success of our network.
