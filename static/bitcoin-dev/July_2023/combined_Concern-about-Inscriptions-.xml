    <summary>Dear Bitcoin developers,I am writing to bring attention to a significant bug in recent versions of the software regarding the "inscriptions" developed by @rodarmor. These inscriptions have grown to a size of 11.8GB on the blockchain within a few months, causing issues with the UTXO set and resulting in a daily growth of approximately 25MB. While there may be ongoing discussions about the nature of these inscriptions, I personally consider them as spam due to their recurring nature and negative impact on the UTXO set and the blockchain.Bitcoin Core offers options to choose the mempool policy, such as datacarrier or permitbaremultisig, but currently, there are no available options specifically for rejecting inscriptions, except for a patch created by Luke Dashjr. Unfortunately, this patch is not practical for most users as it requires compiling Bitcoin Core. It would be beneficial to have options to reject inscriptions in the mempool to allow users to customize their approach and mitigate the negative impact of inscriptions on the network.In addition to the technical concerns, ethical questions also arise from this situation. Inscriptions are primarily used to sell NFTs or Tokens, concepts that have consistently been rejected by the Bitcoin community. Therefore, I kindly request you, as Bitcoin developers, to seriously consider implementing a feature that would enable users to reject inscriptions in the mempool. This measure would contribute to protecting the integrity of the network.Thank you for your attention to this matter.Sincerely,LéoRegarding the concern about why this problem has not been addressed more seriously, the status quo is often preserved when there are no good solutions available. In the case of a significant bug like this, if there is no clear solution, the default approach is to do nothing until a viable solution is found. The same principle applies to other potential issues, such as if ECDSA were to be broken; the initial response would be to maintain the status quo until a compatible solution is identified.The lack of available options to address inscriptions, except for Luke Dashjr's patch, stems from the fact that the real solution should address the underlying problem of the forever-growing initial blockchain download time and UTXO set. While there are changes being made to address these issues, such as "assume UTXO," the code is not yet complete.One reason why there are no options to reject inscriptions in the mempool is that it could lead to a never-ending chase. Blocking one type of inscription may simply result in the creation of different ones. Additionally, inscriptions can exist on chains without Taproot or Segwit, so attempting to block them could lead to the replacement of inscriptions with regular transactions, which would bring back more serious problems related to initial blockchain download time and UTXO size.As for the ethical concerns surrounding inscriptions, it is worth noting that the Bitcoin community has consistently rejected concepts like NFTs and Tokens. However, certain concepts, such as sidechains, have found a place in the ecosystem in a more centralized form. Inscriptions can be seen as a non-enforced soft-fork, where creators believe their rules are being followed but are not enforced by miners and nodes.In conclusion, while I understand the challenges involved in addressing the bug related to inscriptions, I urge you to seriously consider implementing a feature that allows users to reject inscriptions in the mempool. This action would help protect the integrity of the network and discourage further spam attacks of this nature.Thank you for your attention to this matter.Sincerely,Léo</summary>
