    <summary>Dear Bitcoin developers, I am writing to express my concern about a significant bug that seems to have been overlooked in recent versions of the software. This bug pertains to the "inscriptions" developed by @rodarmor, which have rapidly grown to a size of 11.8GB on the blockchain within a few months. This is causing issues with the UTXO set, resulting in a daily growth of approximately 25MB.While there may be ongoing discussions regarding the nature of these inscriptions, I personally view them as spam due to their recurring nature and their negative impact on the size of the UTXO set and the blockchain. I am curious why this problem has not been addressed more seriously.It should be noted that Bitcoin Core offers options to choose the mempool policy, such as datacarrier or permitbaremultisig. However, when it comes to inscriptions, there are currently no available options except for a patch created by Luke Dashjr. Unfortunately, this patch is impractical for most users as it requires compiling Bitcoin Core.Considering this, I believe it would be beneficial to have options to reject inscriptions in the mempool of a node. Such a feature would allow users to customize their approach in managing these cases and help mitigate the negative impact of inscriptions on the network.In addition to the technical concerns, I also find ethical questions arising from this situation. Inscriptions are primarily used to sell NFTs or Tokens, concepts that have consistently been rejected by the Bitcoin community.Therefore, I kindly request you, as Bitcoin developers, to seriously consider implementing a feature that would enable users to reject inscriptions in the mempool. This measure would contribute to protecting the integrity of the network.The problem of inscriptions in the Bitcoin network has not been addressed seriously because there are currently no viable options available. If the ECDSA algorithm were to be compromised, the default response would be to do nothing and wait for a backward-compatible solution. This could involve burning old coins or redistributing them, resulting in different factions within the network. Alternatively, leaving everything untouched could lead to a split in the network, with the strongest chain ultimately determining the course of action.When it comes to inscriptions, there are currently no alternatives except for a patch created by Luke Dashjr. However, this patch only addresses a specific issue related to the growing download time of the initial blockchain and the increasing size of the UTXO set. Other changes aimed at tackling these problems are still under development and incomplete.The absence of options to reject inscriptions in the mempool of a node is due to the fact that it would result in an endless chase. Blocking one type of inscription would simply lead to the creation of different ones. Moreover, inscriptions can exist even on chains without Taproot or Segwit. Attempting to eliminate them would only divert attention from more pressing underlying issues such as the time it takes to initialize the blockchain and the size of the UTXO set.It is worth noting that inscriptions are primarily used to sell NFTs or Tokens, concepts that the Bitcoin community has consistently rejected. However, certain concepts like sidechains, which were also initially rejected, have found a place in the network albeit in a more centralized form. Additionally, some ideas such as soft-forks cannot be stopped once implemented. In the case of inscriptions, creators have essentially introduced a non-enforced soft-fork, assuming their rules are being followed strictly. However, this is not the case as it is possible to create valid Bitcoin transactions that are considered invalid under the additional rules imposed by inscriptions.The issue at hand is the spam attack caused by inscriptions in the Bitcoin network. Unlike other methods of spamming, inscriptions have the ability to embed themselves in the witness and reduce fees. While the standardization rule limiting op_return to 80 bytes has prevented similar abuses, inscriptions remain a significant problem.Taking action against the use of inscriptions could prevent more serious issues, as it would be seen as a rejection of this kind of behavior. However, not taking action could be interpreted as tacit acceptance and may encourage further spam attacks in the future.It is important to note that the proposed solution does not involve implementing a soft fork. Instead, it suggests considering the addition of a standardization option. This would allow the community to decide whether to activate it or not.The lack of available options to reject inscriptions in the mempool of a node is due to the complexity of the problem they present. Blocking one type of inscription would simply lead to the creation of different ones. Additionally, inscriptions are now present even on chains without Taproot or Segwit, further complicating the issue.Inscriptions are primarily used to sell NFTs or Tokens, concepts that the Bitcoin community has consistently rejected. However, it is worth noting that the community has also rejected concepts like sidechains, yet they still exist in a more centralized form.Overall, addressing the spam</summary>
