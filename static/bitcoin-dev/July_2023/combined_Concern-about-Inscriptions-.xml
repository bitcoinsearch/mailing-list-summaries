    <summary>Dear Bitcoin developers,I am writing to address a pressing issue regarding the growth of inscriptions on the blockchain, particularly those developed by @rodarmor. These inscriptions have rapidly reached a size of 11.8GB within a short period, causing significant problems with the UTXO set and resulting in a daily growth of approximately 25MB. Despite ongoing discussions about the nature of these inscriptions, I personally consider them to be spam due to their recurring presence and negative impact on the network.I would like to understand why this problem has not been given more serious attention. While Bitcoin Core provides options to choose the mempool policy, such as datacarrier or permitbaremultisig, there are currently no available alternatives to handle inscriptions apart from a patch created by Luke Dashjr. Unfortunately, this patch is not practical for most users as it requires compiling Bitcoin Core.In light of this, I propose the implementation of a feature that allows users to reject inscriptions in the mempool of a node. This would provide users with the flexibility to manage these cases according to their preferences and help mitigate the adverse effects of inscriptions on the network.Beyond the technical concerns, ethical questions also arise. Inscriptions are predominantly used for selling NFTs or Tokens, concepts that have consistently faced rejection from the Bitcoin community. It is essential to protect the integrity of the network by addressing this issue and providing users with the means to reject inscriptions if they choose to do so.I sincerely urge you, as Bitcoin developers, to seriously consider the implementation of a feature that enables users to reject inscriptions in the mempool. This step would contribute to maintaining the network's integrity and addressing the challenges posed by inscriptions.Thank you for your attention to this matter.Sincerely,Léo</summary>
