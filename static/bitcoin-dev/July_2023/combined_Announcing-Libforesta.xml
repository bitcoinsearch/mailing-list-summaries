    <summary>Davidson Souza introduces a project called `libfloresta` to the Bitcoin devs mailing list. This project is a derivative of his previous project called `Floresta` and is a fully-validating Bitcoin full node with an integrated watch-only wallet and Electrum Server. The main objective of `libfloresta` is to create a compact, simple, and ready-to-use full node for low-power devices such as single-board computers (SBC) and smartphones, although it can be used in any environment. To achieve this, Davidson is writing the main logic of the project in Rust and generating bindings to the original code, which allows it to run virtually anywhere by compiling it to WebAssembly (WASM).Although the project is still in its early stages, Davidson has been using it on signet without any problems. Mainnet support is almost ready, but there are some performance issues with bridge nodes that need to be resolved before utreexo peers can be set up. Davidson provides a link to the project's GitHub repository where the code is available, as well as a blog post explaining how to use the project in Rust. He plans to write more blog posts as the project matures and is deployed on other platforms. Feedback on the project is welcomed.In terms of consensus, Davidson clarifies that `libfloresta` does not reimplement the Bitcoin Consensus machine from scratch. Instead, he is using `libbitcoinconsensus` and plans to utilize the full `libbitcoinkernel` in the future. This approach minimizes misimplementations that could lead to splits, although it does not guarantee consistency. Davidson also mentions that he is cross-testing against Bitcoin Core to identify any inconsistencies before they cause any trouble.Davidson concludes his message by expressing his gratitude to Vinteum for supporting his work with utreexo and Floresta.</summary>
