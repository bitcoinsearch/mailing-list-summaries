    <summary>Hello Bitcoin developers,I am writing to express my concern about a significant bug that seems to have been overlooked in recent versions of the software. The bug pertains to the "inscriptions" developed by @rodarmor, which have grown to a size of 11.8GB on the blockchain in just a few months. This rapid growth is causing issues with the UTXO set, which is expanding by approximately 25MB per day.While there may be ongoing discussions about the nature of these inscriptions, I find it difficult not to view them as spam. Their repetitive nature and their impact on the size of the UTXO set and the blockchain itself are concerning. I would appreciate a deeper understanding of why this problem has not been addressed more seriously.It is worth noting that Bitcoin Core offers options for choosing the mempool policy, such as datacarrier or permitbaremultisig. However, when it comes to inscriptions, there are no available options except for a patch created by Luke Dashjr. Unfortunately, this patch is not practical for most users as it requires compiling Bitcoin Core.I am curious as to why there are no options to reject inscriptions in the mempool of a node. Such a feature could empower users to customize their approach in managing these particular cases and help mitigate the negative impact of inscriptions on the network.In addition to the technical issues, this situation raises ethical questions. Inscriptions are predominantly used for selling NFTs or Tokens, concepts that the Bitcoin community has consistently rejected.Therefore, I kindly request that you, as Bitcoin developers, take this concern into consideration and seriously contemplate implementing a feature that would allow users to reject inscriptions in the mempool. Such a measure would contribute to safeguarding the integrity of the network.Thank you for your attention to this matter.LÃ©o.</summary>
