    <summary>Antoine Riard expresses his support for starting small and focusing on consensus change primitives in the development approach. He cites the success of taproot and the community-wide taproot review as examples of good historical processes. Antoine also discusses the authority of BOLTs and emphasizes the need to judge each BOLT individually based on its technical merits. He mentions some areas of Lightning Network operations that are not documented by the BOLTs, such as fee-bumping and transaction broadcast reactions.Antoine brings up the uncertainty surrounding the technical fitness of Simplicity for 2/small party channels and raises questions about its functionality in a chain of transactions and in the context of off-chain states. He suggests that a consensus needs to be reached on the model of logic followed for the analysis of such distributed systems and mentions Leslie Lamport's temporal logic as a potential framework. Additionally, Antoine mentions ongoing research on the theoretical foundations of the Coq prover by Xavier Leroy, which could be useful for formal verification in Bitcoin consensus changes development.In another email thread, Greg Sanders discusses the complexity of the Lightning Network (LN) and the limitations of covenants in resolving that complexity. He suggests that more than CTV is needed to simplify LN and mentions the existence of other BOLTs that need to be considered. Greg proposes a different approach, suggesting that one should imagine having Simplicity and see what can be built with it, then work backwards to see if it can be accomplished within the confines of Bitcoin script.Keagan McClelland responds to Antoine's earlier email, expressing agreement with the importance of a smooth functioning LN but also highlighting the potential benefits of covenant schemes in simplifying LN proposals. Keagan acknowledges that the prioritization of covenants and LN development is a complex issue but argues that covenants can significantly contribute to LN's maturity.Antoine Riard initiates a discussion about the process of specifying covenants for Bitcoin. He mentions the goals of building a consistent framework for evaluating covenant proposals, finding common grounds between proposals, opening up the consensus changes development process beyond Bitcoin Core, and maintaining a high-quality technical archive. Antoine refers to previous discussions on covenant proposals and their potential impact on self-custody solutions. He acknowledges that his focus has shifted towards Lightning Network development due to its critical importance for Bitcoin's survival.Antoine provides an update on the Bitcoin Contracting Primitives Working Group (WG), including the establishment of a Github repository to document various primitives and protocols related to covenants. He mentions monthly meetings and in-depth discussions on topics such as payment pools and vaults. However, he acknowledges that he has been less active in running online meetings since April due to his focus on Lightning Network development.Antoine concludes by stating that the smooth functioning of the Lightning Network with a large number of users is more critical for Bitcoin's survival than advanced covenant capabilities. He expresses his intention to allocate his time and energy towards Lightning Network robustness and R&amp;D works on CoinPool. Antoine also mentions the possibility of submitting security reviews of consensus changes under pseudonyms and recommends Greg Maxwell's joinpool for experimentation with payment pools.In a recent email on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Antoine Riard expressed his interest in collaborating with developers to ensure that any proposed consensus changes undergo thorough testing before deployment. He emphasized the importance of maintaining high standards of Bitcoin decentralization and FOSS neutrality. Antoine also mentioned the possibility of working on the Bitcoin Contracting Primitives WG or organizing industry-wide workshops on covenants, similar to what was done for Taproot in 2019. Antoine invited individuals who are willing to contribute to reach out, provided they have the necessary proof-of-work and resources to support their long-term involvement. He shared several links to previous discussions and documents related to these topics. Antoine acknowledged Jeremy Rubin's thesis that product management is not just one person's responsibility, particularly when it comes to consensus changes. He believes that the technical complexity of such changes requires collaboration among a group of elite developers. Furthermore, Antoine mentioned that he has received interest and commitments from R&amp;D non-profits, individual investors, and venture capital firms to support the advancement of softforks and covenants in the Bitcoin space. This indicates that there are opportunities for individuals with a reliable track record to work full-time on consensus changes.Overall, Antoine's email highlights his commitment to ensuring the thorough testing of proposed consensus changes, his willingness to collaborate with developers, and the potential opportunities available for individuals interested in contributing to the Bitcoin ecosystem.</summary>
