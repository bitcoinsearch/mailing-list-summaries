    <summary>In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Erik Aronesty suggested that any time a public key is transmitted, it should come with a "proof of secret key" (POSK). This would help prevent accidental vulnerabilities. The discussion can be found at this link: https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/be7a4760dd4596d06963d67baf140406.However, Andrew Poelstra, Director of Research at Blockstream, pointed out that POSKs are not a panacea. For example, in MuSig, using POSK to eliminate rogue key attacks instead of rerandomizing the keys could lead to issues. The last person to contribute a key could modify the final key by adding a Taproot commitment, which other participants wouldn't know about. This means they could still produce a POSK without affecting knowledge of the secret key.Furthermore, producing POSKs can be logistically difficult in many contexts. It requires an interactive challenge-response process, meaning that all participants need to be online and have secret key access during key setup. Additionally, if a protocol requires provably published POSKs, difficulties arise because embedding them on-chain doesn't make sense. POSKs are twice as big as the keys themselves and blockchain validators don't care about them. Therefore, an alternative publication medium needs to be established.Another challenge arises when supporting nested multisignatures. Jointly producing POSKs for nested multisignatures adds complexity to the protocol.Andrew Poelstra mentioned that the MuSig and MuSig2 papers address these concerns. The schemes developed for MuSig were designed to be provably secure in the plain public key model, making POSKs unnecessary and avoiding logistical hurdles.Overall, while the idea of including a proof of secret key with transmitted public keys may seem beneficial, there are practical challenges and potential vulnerabilities associated with implementing it.</summary>
