    <summary>In an email on 07/06/2023, a user named alicexbt expressed concerns about the acceptance of unconfirmed inputs in coinjoin transactions. They highlighted that allowing unconfirmed inputs could pose a safety risk as the sender of the unconfirmed transaction can replace it and potentially invalidate the coinjoin. The user also pointed out that coordinator B should not accept the unconfirmed UTXO from step 2 because it is unaware of that transaction and has zero fees, making it unlikely to be relayed.The user acknowledged that a similar attack could already be carried out by registering the same UTXO with multiple coordinators without the need for package relay. However, they recognized that package relay could still be beneficial for coinjoins. With package relay, any participant in the coinjoin can rebroadcast it with a further Child Pays for Parent (CPFP) if the coinjoin falls below the minimum relay fee. The user also mentioned upcoming proposals for Replace-By-Fee (RBF) in package transactions, which could allow other child transactions in the package to RBF the entire transaction, eliminating the need for all participants to re-sign the coinjoin for RBF.Overall, the user raised concerns about the acceptance of unconfirmed inputs in coinjoins and discussed the potential benefits of package relay and upcoming RBF proposals for enhancing the security and efficiency of coinjoin transactions.The user also addressed Bitcoin developers, alerting them to a potential vulnerability in coinjoin that could be exploited for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. This vulnerability is related to the use of the package relay feature, which introduces new P2P messages, transaction relay, and other functionalities comparable to a soft fork.To illustrate the vulnerability, the user described two coinjoin implementations, A and B. The attack starts by registering an input in implementation A. The attacker then double-spends the same input with zero fees to their own address. Next, the attacker registers the unconfirmed UTXO from step 2 in implementation B. Implementation B then relays a package containing a coinjoin transaction (child) that pays for the double-spent input (parent).The user highlighted that both users and implementation B have incentives to engage in this type of attack. They also mentioned an alternative approach where the attacker registers the same input in both implementations A and B. However, this approach presents tradeoffs as implementing RBF with multiple users is not straightforward and can be costly. Additionally, implementations with fewer participants in a round would have an advantage in this scenario.The user emphasized the importance of addressing this vulnerability promptly to ensure the security and integrity of coinjoin transactions. They urged Bitcoin developers to review the details provided in the package relay proposal and requested feedback on any overlooked aspects.The email was sent using Proton Mail secure email by /dev/fd0floppy disk guy.</summary>
