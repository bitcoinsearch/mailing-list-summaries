    <summary>In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, there has been a dispute regarding the research conducted by Daniel Lipshitz from GAP600. Lipshitz claims that GAP600 services multiple merchants, such as Coinpayments and Coinspaid, who accept unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions with the use of mitigation tools. However, Peter Todd challenges this claim and questions the validity of Lipshitz's findings.Todd clarifies that both Coinpayments and Coinspaid are payment processors and not individual merchants accepting unconfirmed payments. He couldn't find any evidence on their websites indicating acceptance of unconfirmed transactions. As for Changelly, Todd argues that their website clearly states an average transaction speed of 5-40 minutes, which does not qualify as an unconfirmed payment. Test transactions were also conducted, confirming that Changelly does not accept unconfirmed payments.Based on these findings, Todd challenges Lipshitz to provide concrete examples of actual merchants who rely on unconfirmed transactions. Todd also requests additional evidence, including emails and contacts from mining pools that have adopted full Replace-by-Fee (RBF), to support Lipshitz's claims.The proposal to add a "first seen safe" rule to mitigate the negative impact of full RBF on merchants and users who accept zero-confirmation transactions is discussed. Lipshitz expresses concerns about the potential negative impact of full RBF and highlights the usage of GAP600's service by various clients, including Coinpayments, Coinspaid, and Changelly.However, further investigation reveals that Coinpayments and Coinspaid are payment processors rather than merchants accepting unconfirmed payments. Their websites do not indicate acceptance of unconfirmed transactions. Additionally, Changelly's website explicitly states that they ensure swift transactions within 5-40 minutes, indicating that they do not accept unconfirmed payments.Based on these findings, it appears that there is no genuine example of an actual merchant accepting unconfirmed transactions and relying on the first-seen behavior. Todd suggests that the lack of impact on double spend rates for GAP600's transactions is because they do not have clients who rely on unconfirmed payments.The implementation of full RBF in Bitcoin transactions without a "first seen safe" rule could have negative consequences. GAP600 aims to prevent these consequences by requiring any replacement transactions to include the original outputs. However, Todd questions the validity of Lipshitz's claims and requests more evidence to support them.In conclusion, there is a dispute regarding the research conducted by Lipshitz from GAP600. Todd challenges the claims made by Lipshitz and questions the validity of his findings. The discussion also highlights the need for concrete examples and additional evidence to support the claims regarding merchants accepting unconfirmed transactions and the impact of full RBF.</summary>
