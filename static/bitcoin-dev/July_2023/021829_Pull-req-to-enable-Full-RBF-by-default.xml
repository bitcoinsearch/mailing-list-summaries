    <summary>The implementation of full Replace-by-Fee (RBF) in Bitcoin transactions has raised concerns about its impact on merchants and users who rely on zero-confirmation transactions (0-conf). To mitigate this negative effect, the suggestion is to introduce a "first seen safe" rule, which allows transactions to be replaced but requires the inclusion of the original outputs.GAP600, a service provider for BTC transactions, has observed a significant usage of their platform with approximately 350k unique transaction hashes per month over the past three months. Notable clients of GAP600 include Coinpayments, Coinspaid, and Changelly. During periods of high transaction volume, such as when the Mempool is full, the required fees for approval on the GAP600 platform have increased. Despite this, the current system can be easily maintained without any major issues.In support of their argument, GAP600 has previously provided statistics and received feedback from Coinspaid CEO, which can be found in the mailing list discussion here: [link to mailing list].Furthermore, GAP600 claims that they have not observed any impact on double spend rates for their transactions due to the full RBF implementation. This contradicts the widely reported figure of 40% adoption of RBF by miners. If such a high rate of adoption were accurate, an increase in double spends would be expected. However, GAP600 anticipates that once full RBF becomes the default setting, the adoption of their service may significantly change.It is important to note that GAP600 does not function as a payment processor but rather serves payment processors, merchants, and non-custodial liquidity providers that cater to non-custodial wallets. Accuracy in predicting double spends is crucial for GAP600, as they reimburse their clients in case of any errors.Overall, the implementation of a first seen safe rule and considering the specific use cases of services like GAP600 could help avoid the potential negative impact of full RBF on merchants and users who rely on 0-conf transactions.</summary>
