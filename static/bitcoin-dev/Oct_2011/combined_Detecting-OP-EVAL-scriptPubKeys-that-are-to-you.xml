    <summary>In this discussion, Michael Gr√∏nager argues that the script is part of the cryptographic key. He points out that it's impossible for clients to identify funds without knowing the information required and suggests using op_eval to gain its advantages. However, he opposes checkmultisig as a standard transaction type because he sees it as a bijection between hash160s and public keys, which could moot the flexibility of the script system. He also notes that some projects rely on the current mapping between pubkey and uint160 and warns against introducing overly complicated procedures that would create major problems for these projects. Gavin Andresen offers a solution by giving the hash to whoever is paying and storing the hash-script mapping, but Michael argues that it's already the case that one can generate private keys on behalf of others.</summary>
