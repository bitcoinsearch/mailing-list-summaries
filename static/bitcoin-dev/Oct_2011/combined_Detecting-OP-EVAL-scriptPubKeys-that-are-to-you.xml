    <summary>In a discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of op_eval as a standard transaction type, Michael Gr√∏nager argues that the current bitcoin address system allows for a one-to-one mapping between a public key and uint160. He believes adding scripts would break this logic and cause confusion. However, Gavin Andresen suggests using hashes to store the script and mapping them when receiving payments. Michael opposes checkmultisig as a standard transaction type due to a misunderstanding that there is a bijection between hash160s and public keys. Instead, he supports a multiparty signoff scheme for wallet security. He also warns that interpreting all non-standard transactions as broken could result in unexpected and insecure tools. Projects like blockexplorer and bitcoin-js use the same procedure to extract identifying information regardless of the address format. Ultimately, Michael opposes op_eval as a standard transaction type.</summary>
