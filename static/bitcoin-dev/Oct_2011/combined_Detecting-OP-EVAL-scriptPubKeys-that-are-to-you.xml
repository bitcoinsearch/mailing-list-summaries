    <summary>In an email exchange on October 25 and 26, 2011, Bitcoin developers discussed the possibility of a standard (multikey) payment that would hide the address or make it overly complicated to extract. Michael Gr√∏nager argued that it was already a clean setup where cryptographic keys could be mapped to assets and saw no functional difference between the current system and one with op_eval script. He questioned how else the advantages of op_eval could be gained without it. With respect to checkmultisig as a standard transaction type, he opposed it after the discussion because there is a misunderstanding that there is a bijection between hash160s and public keys, and one between ECC private keys and spendable transactions, which is not essential to Bitcoin. Gavin Andresen suggested giving the hash to whoever is paying and storing the hash-script mapping while using a deterministic wallet.</summary>
