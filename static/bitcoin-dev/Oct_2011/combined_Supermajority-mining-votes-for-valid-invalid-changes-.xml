    <summary>The distributed algorithm can be changed in a way that invalidates previously valid transactions without creating lasting chain splits. This has been proposed for the addition of the eval opcode by using one of the existing NOPs. However, if transactions are emitted that are invalid under the new scheme but valid under the old after the block height that the rule is coded to take effect and a super-majority of miners are not yet upgraded, the upgrade may cause a long reorganization and serious disruption.To avoid this, upgraded nodes must follow certain rules. They should never forward or mine a transaction that would be invalid under the new rule, apply old behavior before height X unconditionally (X set far enough in the future to get reasonable deployment by large miners), and begin applying the new rule only after the first point in the chain after X when none of the last Y blocks have contained an invalid transaction under the new rules.After the software has been released, members of the bitcoin community can intentionally transmit transactions that are invalid under the new rules. By setting Y high enough that all major miners have a chance to mine in the window, this becomes an effective vote for the change by miners with a stochastic super-majority threshold. Nodes can determine precisely at what block the election has completed because it is an objective fact of the chain.With this scheme, the new encoding will only become active when enough mining capacity supports it (or at least helpfully refuses to mine the whole class of transactions) so that a large reorganization will not happen due to incompatible blocks during deployment. The proposal can also be enhanced with conflicting block discouragement, but this scheme is considered sufficient without that.Another proposed safeguard requires 50% of the last Y blocks to contain a coinbase with an "I am upgraded" code before applying the new rule. Until the new rule is active, an "I am upgraded" code should be included in every block, which can be turned off after it is active. The active statement constitutes a proof, as it allows for knowing with specific confidence (based on the window size) how likely a fork of length X will be if a newly invalid transaction is announced at the time of activation.</summary>
