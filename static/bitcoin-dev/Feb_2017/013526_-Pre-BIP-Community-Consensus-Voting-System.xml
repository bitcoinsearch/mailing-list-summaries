    <summary>The author of the given context likes the idea of having some way for developers to show that they have genuinely considered a proposal before rejecting it. However, the author does not think that an on-chain system would make sense as it would make things complicated and add code and incentives. The author prefers to think of Bitcoin as a system of vetos rather than approvals as small technical changes do not need support outside the devs. Furthermore, the author believes that legitimate objections should not involve money or political power, and anyone with a valid objection should be able to raise it. The author agrees with the motivation behind having a system to figure out who has considered a proposal and what their opinions are. However, the author does not want any systemization around passing or failing a proposal and no barrier to entry for providing an opinion.</summary>
