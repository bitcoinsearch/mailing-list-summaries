    <summary>The author of the above context likes the idea of having a way for developers to show that they have considered an idea legitimately before rejecting it. However, they believe that an on-chain system would complicate things and add unnecessary code and incentives. The author prefers thinking of Bitcoin as a system of vetos rather than approvals since some changes are small and highly technical and don't require support outside of the devs. Additionally, the author believes that legitimate objections should not cost money or political power, and anyone with a legitimate objection should be able to raise one irrespective of their age or recognition. While the author agrees with the motivation, they'd like to see a system that doesn't have any standardization around passing or failing a proposal and has no barriers to entry for providing opinions.</summary>
