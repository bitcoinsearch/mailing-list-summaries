    <summary>The writer likes the idea of developers showing legitimate consideration for proposals, but does not believe an on-chain system is necessary. They prefer Bitcoin to be a system of vetos rather than approvals, with small technical changes requiring only developer support. The writer believes that it should not cost money or political power to raise an objection, and that everyone, regardless of age or recognition, should be able to provide their opinion. The writer agrees with the motivation behind the proposal tracking system, but wants it to be open without any systemization or barriers to entry for opinions.</summary>
