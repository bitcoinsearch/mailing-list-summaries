    <summary>A new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) called the Community Converged Voting System (CCVS) has been proposed to improve the decision-making process within the Bitcoin community. The CCVS aims to enable developers to gauge support for BIPs before implementing them and to measure consensus for potential alterations to the Bitcoin protocol. It intends to implement whichever BIP the community prefers and eliminate any attempt at manipulating results by voting repeatedly.Voting for the CCVS would last for a predetermined period, concluding when a specific block number is mined. Each competing BIP will be assigned a unique bitcoin address that will be added to each header. Those wanting to vote would cast their ballot by sending a small amount of 0.0001 btc to their preferred BIP's address. Mining Pools, companies using Bitcoin, and Core maintainers/contributors are allowed one confirmed vote each, which is worth 10,000x a regular vote.Confirmed votes would be added to a new section in each respective BIP as a public record. However, the issue of node voting has not yet been resolved. Although the CCVS has the potential to improve the decision-making process, it is desirable for any full node running an up-to-date blockchain to be able to vote with a multiplier, but it is outside the scope of this BIP.Some people have expressed concerns about the system, stating that any on-chain system complicates things and adds code, incentives, etc. They believe all that's needed is some sort of indication of consideration, support, or rejection. Others prefer to think of Bitcoin as a system of vetoes rather than a system of approvals, where changes will be small, highly technical, and have no visible impact to ordinary users, and don't really need support outside the developers.Furthermore, they argue that there should be no cost or political power involved in raising an objection, and that involving money is almost certainly going to shut down important valid opinions. They would like to see a system where it's easier to figure out who had considered a proposal and what their objections or praises were, without any systemization around what is required to pass or fail a proposal, and with no barrier to entry (such as voting or sending coins or having a recognized name like 'Bitfury') to provide an opinion.</summary>
