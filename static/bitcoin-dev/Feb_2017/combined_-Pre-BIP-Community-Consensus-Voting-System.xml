    <summary>The Community Consensus Voting System (CCVS) is a proposed solution to the lack of consensus measurement for potential changes to the Bitcoin protocol. It aims to allow the public, miners, companies using Bitcoin, and developers to vote for their preferred Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) in a way that's difficult to manipulate. Each competing BIP will be assigned a unique bitcoin address, which is added to each header. Voters would cast their ballot by sending a small amount of 0.0001 btc to their preferred BIP's address. The Confirmed Vote Multiplier is also introduced to give a larger voice to organizations and people who will have to implement whatever BIP the community prefers.However, the author of the given context believes that an on-chain system would make things complicated and add code and incentives. They prefer to think of Bitcoin as a system of vetoes rather than approvals as small technical changes do not need support outside the devs. The author argues that legitimate objections should not involve money or political power, and anyone with a valid objection should be able to raise it. They are concerned about maintaining an open and inclusive environment where all voices are heard and valued equally.The CCVS will allow developers to measure support for BIPs before implementing them and will provide a means of measuring consensus for potential changes to the Bitcoin protocol. However, the issue of node voting has not been resolved yet. Although it would be desirable for any full node running an up-to-date blockchain to be able to vote with a multiplier, it is outside the scope of this BIP. The author does not want any systemization around passing or failing a proposal and no barrier to entry for providing an opinion.In conclusion, while tracking opinions on proposals can be beneficial, the author argues that it should not come at the expense of openness and accessibility. The community should strive to create a culture of collaboration and respect, where everyone's voice is heard and valued equally. Allowing everyone to share their thoughts and ideas, regardless of their background or experience, can lead to greater innovation and creativity. By embracing diversity and inclusivity, the community can benefit from a wider range of perspectives and insights.</summary>
