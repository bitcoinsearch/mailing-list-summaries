    <summary>A new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) called the Community Convergent Voting System (CCVS) has been introduced to improve the implementation process of community-approved BIPs. The CCVS proposal aims to help developers measure support for BIPs before implementing them and provide a means of measuring consensus for potential changes to the Bitcoin protocol.The CCVS system would allow individuals and entities in the Bitcoin community to vote on proposed changes to the protocol, with confirmed votes being worth 10,000 times a regular vote, preventing anyone from skewing the results by voting repeatedly. Mining pools, companies that use Bitcoin, and Core maintainers and contributors are allowed one confirmed vote each. The voting period would run for a set time period, ending when a particular block number is mined. Confirmed votes would be added to a new section in each respective BIP as a public record. However, the issue of node voting has not been resolved yet. While it would be desirable for any full node running an up-to-date blockchain to be able to vote with a multiplier (e.g. 100x), this is outside the scope of this particular BIP.Despite the motivation behind the CCVS proposal, some developers have concerns about the system. They prefer to think of Bitcoin as a system of vetoes rather than approvals, where legitimate technical, social, or political objections hold more weight than mere support percentages. Furthermore, they argue that on-chain systems are unnecessary and can add complications and barriers to entry. It should not cost money or political power to raise an objection, and anyone should be able to do so without a recognized name or financial investment.</summary>
