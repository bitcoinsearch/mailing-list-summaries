    <summary>In an email conversation, a suggestion was made to split pull request 319 into two separate requests, one for adding the IsStandard change and another for adding the full escrow feature set. The reasoning behind this was that the IsStandard part is uncontroversial and can be implemented quickly with the hope of getting most mining power to upgrade, while the full escrow feature set would require more discussion and testing before being added to the client. Pull request 349 implements a multiple signature escrowed transaction which is something that the author believes should be added sooner rather than later, especially with clearcoin gone.The pull request has been tested on a private network and appears to work well but requires more testing and discussion before it can be added to the client. One challenge to its deployment is that because it requires a new transaction type, it won't be deployable until an updated IsStandard is widely used in the network. However, the patch exposes an issue with multisig validation where it's possible to code a script multiple ways due to redundancy in the script length coding opcodes. One candidate fix for this is excluding the length opcodes from the comparison, but this carries a risk of creating differences in how nodes validate transactions leading to lasting forks. Another way of fixing this would be to define that OP_PUSHDATA* cannot be used to push smaller lengths which could be more efficiently encoded with the direct length opcodes. Alternatively, changing how the templating code works to ensure it codes the template the same way the original was coded could potentially be beneficial if the same class of problem exists for things other than the length coding.</summary>
