    <summary>Gavin Andresen expressed his doubts regarding awarding bounties for fixing bugs, saying it would not encourage long-term contributors. He suggested branching for releases and focusing on bug-fix-only-releases to improve the software's reliability. Rick Wesson proposed offering a bounty on the technical lead rather than bugs, stating that quality software is essential for increasing bitcoin's value. Gavin Andresen was leading the effort but will work full-time on bitcoin pending his return from Australia. The boost testing framework is already implemented, although it lacks tests. Rick Wesson suggested using Google Test or another C++ framework to further test the software.</summary>
