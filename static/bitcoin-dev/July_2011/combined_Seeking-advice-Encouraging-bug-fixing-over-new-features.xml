    <summary>Gavin Andresen, a Bitcoin developer, expressed his doubts about the effectiveness of small bounties to motivate long-term contributors to fix bugs. He believed that this approach would only encourage hastily patched-together fixes rather than comprehensive solutions. However, other developers like Rick Wesson believed that bounties could be effective if applied correctly, such as by offering them to experienced technical leads instead of just bug-fixers. Additionally, there was a suggestion to put a bounty on improving the project's testing framework, which was identified as needing more work. Gavin also mentioned his support for branching for releases and confirmed that he had arranged to work full-time on Bitcoin development when he returned from vacation.</summary>
