    <summary>In a discussion on Bitcoin's development in 2011, Gavin Andresen questioned the idea of offering bitcoin bounties for bug fixes. While he believed it would motivate some people, he thought it wouldn't encourage long-term contributors. Instead, he supported the idea of branching for releases to work well for bug fixes and new features. He also mentioned arranging to get paid to work on Bitcoin full-time before leaving for Australia. Rick Wesson suggested putting a bounty on the test framework to put some loose change to work. Gavin Andresen responded that they already had the boost testing framework implemented but lacked many tests. Another suggestion was to put a salary bounty on the person leading the effort rather than on bugs. However, there were concerns about how much time Gavin had to spend on development over PR and other project-building efforts despite his leadership.</summary>
