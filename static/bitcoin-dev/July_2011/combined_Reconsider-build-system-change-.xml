    <summary>The discussion on choosing a new build system for Bitcoin is ongoing. While some argue that CMake would be a good choice due to its cross-platform support and clearer syntax, others suggest that Autotools are more standard. However, it should be noted that the Autotools patch needs to be redone before it can be merged. Additionally, CMake requires installation while Autotools does not. Cross-compiling is supported by CMake, which generates native build scripts for Make, XCode, and Visual Studio. Meanwhile, Autotools only supports Make. Pieter Wuille doesn't have a preference for a particular build system as long as it meets certain criteria such as easy setup, cross-compilation to Windows, support for OSX, and ease of maintenance.</summary>
