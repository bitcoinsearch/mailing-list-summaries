    <summary>There were discussions in 2011 on the Bitcoin-development mailing list regarding whether to use Autotools or CMake as a build system for future versions of bitcoin. As per the conversation, it seems like no conscious decision was taken and someone submitted an Autotools patch, which sparked conversations about merging Autotools. However, the Autotools stuff needed revamping before it could be merged into the project. It was pointed out that Autotools is more standard than CMake, and since it's a shell script, there's no need to install CMake, which doesn't come standard on almost any distros. Another email from Pieter Wuille said that he had no preference for any particular project build system, and he'd have no problem with choosing a system that meets certain criteria. These included being easy enough to set up, allowing building of the bitcoin codebase on several Linux distros, supporting cross-compilation to Windows, supporting OSX, and being easy to maintain. He also mentioned that the chosen system should not be too hard to adapt other GUIs to use it (bitcoin-qt, maybe others as well, i hear about a cocoabitcoin?).</summary>
