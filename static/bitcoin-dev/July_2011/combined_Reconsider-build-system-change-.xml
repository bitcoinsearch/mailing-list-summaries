    <summary>In a mailing list discussion in 2011, there was a debate about whether to use autotools or CMake as the build system for bitcoin. Matt stated that no one made a conscious decision and that whoever writes the build system would have to redo the autotools stuff before merging it with the codebase. However, he also mentioned that autotools are more standard than CMake and since it's a shell script, it doesn't require installation like CMake which doesn't come standard on almost any distros. John Smith argued that CMake generates native build scripts for Make (all platforms), XCode, Visual Studio while Autoconf only does Make. Moreover, CMake has a clearer syntax and is very fast. It is also supported natively in Qt Creator in the QT SDK and used by many other KDE/QT as well as other open-source applications. On the other hand, Pieter Wuille had no preference for any particular project build system and suggested that the chosen system should be easy to set up, allow building of the bitcoin codebase on several Linux distros, support cross-compilation to Windows, support OSX, be easy to maintain, and not too hard to adapt other GUIs to use it.</summary>
