    <summary>The discussion about which build system to use for the bitcoin codebase has been ongoing since 2011. While someone submitted an autotools patch, it was noted that the autotools system needs to be redone before it can be merged. CMake was suggested as an alternative option due to its support for native build scripts for multiple platforms, clearer syntax, speed, and integration with various open source applications. However, it was also noted that CMake is not included in standard repositories and therefore requires installation. Additionally, CMake's cross-compiling capabilities were highlighted. Pieter Wuille expressed that he did not have a preference for any particular build system, but listed several requirements that the chosen system would need to meet. These include being easy to set up, supporting multiple Linux distros, cross-compiling to Windows, supporting OSX, being easy to maintain, and being adaptable for other GUIs.</summary>
