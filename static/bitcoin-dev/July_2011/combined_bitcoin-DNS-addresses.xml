    <summary>The discussion between Rick Wesson and Matt was regarding the use of DNS or HTTPS for resolution of Bitcoin addresses. DNS resolution of Bitcoin addresses is considered unsafe due to potential MITM attacks, and DNSSEC is not a security measure that could mitigate the issue. On the other hand, HTTPS offers some advantages such as ease of offering up different IPs to different people by IP address.Furthermore, HTTPS has already been coded and implemented, while DNSSEC implementation requires a recursive nameserver inside Bitcoin with root trust anchors hardcoded in. While DNS is frequently leveraged as a proxy for identity, HTTPS mapping offers clear advantages over DNS, and there are no clear advantages for using DNS over HTTPS.The thread began with a query about whether anyone had written an easy button for bitcoind. It was pointed out that the same attack can apply to HTTPS with a self-signed cert where it is the A record that is replaced by the attacker. Windows has supported DNSSEC since 2008 as have most of the Unix variants, Mac OSX since 10.3, and Android also seems to include DNSSEC capable resolvers.The conversation then moved on to discussing the usability issues surrounding Bitcoin addresses. There was a proposal to produce a patch to sendtoaddress in rpc.cpp to support DNS lookups so that one could publish a TXT record in the DNS with their wallet address to facilitate sending of coin. However, using URIs was deemed much simpler and more useful in terms of being able to give different addresses and/or values per user.It was also noted that despite DNSSec being "out there," DNS is still very insecure to transmit something that will result in money transfer. If users want nice name to address mapping, a simple HTTPS server with addresses and client support works much better in the end. The discussion was mainly about usability and user experience. Though Bitcoin might make DNSSEC more popular, it is still insignificant compared to DNS's popularity.</summary>
