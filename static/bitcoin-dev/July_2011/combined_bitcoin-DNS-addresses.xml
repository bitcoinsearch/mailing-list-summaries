    <summary>The discussion revolves around the security of DNS-based resolving for Bitcoin addresses, with a focus on the potential for MITM attacks through DNS resolution. It is argued that DNSSEC is not sufficient in providing security measures, as the application would require its own dnssec enabled stub resolver.HTTPS is proposed as a better option for resolution because it allows for giving different addresses to each client based on IP, making it easier to offer up different addresses to different people. Though HTTPS' advantages may be small in this context, there are no apparent benefits to using DNS over HTTPS.It is mentioned that DNS mapping does not prevent or deny anyone from leveraging HTTP(S) for similar mapping. The point is made that while DNS has done a decent job in name-to-thing mapping, it may not be the best option for usability and user experience.Rick Wesson, a member of the list, asked if anyone has written the https-address-resolver-easy-button for bitcoind. The reply was that it has already been written twice. However, some users expressed security concerns when using DNSSEC for Bitcoin address communication.One user suggested that using HTTPS is a better option due to its several advantages over DNSSEC-based solutions. Another user suggested that if Rick wants name-to-address mapping, a simple HTTPS server with addresses and client support works much better in the end.Finally, it is expressed that Bitcoin is still tiny, and it is doubtful that it will make a difference to DNSSEC adoption.</summary>
