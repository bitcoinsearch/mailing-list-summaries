    <summary>A forum post by John Smith proposes to add notifications to the Bitcoin client and wallet, aiming to decouple user interface and core communication. He suggests using the boost::signal mechanism, which allows decoupled delivery of signals from an object, and multiple other objects to listen in on an event without the emitting object having to care. Smith then provides a list of specific notifications that would be useful for both the wallet and network client. For the wallet, these include balance changed, transaction added, transaction updated, address added/updated/removed, notification, and ask fee. Meanwhile, for the network client, these include num connections changed, num blocks changed, and notification. The idea is to enable clean separation of pieces and large-scale rewrites without touching anything but the parts being redone.</summary>
