    <summary>The proposal is to add notifications to the client and wallet in order to decouple UI and core communication and eliminate the need for UIs to poll for changes. The boost::signal mechanism is proposed for this purpose, which allows decoupled delivery of signals from an object and multiple other objects can listen in on an event. Specific notifications that would be useful include balanceChanged (int64), transactionAdded/Updated/Removed (int256) and addressAdded/Updated/Removed (int160). The notification function can also notify users of any warning/error occurred in network processing. A new connections/connections broken signal as well as a new blocks changed signal are proposed for the Network client. The implementation of these signals requires a central notification interface that wallet(s)/net/block store/etc all communicate with, and then an interface that GUI/RPC/etc use to communicate with wallet/net.</summary>
