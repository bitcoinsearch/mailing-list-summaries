    <summary>The email thread discusses the proposal to add notifications to the client and wallet to decouple UI and core communication so that UIs no longer need to poll for changes. The proposed solution is to use the boost::signal mechanism, which allows decoupled delivery of 'signals' from an object. Multiple other objects can listen in on an event without the emitting object having to care. Specific notifications that would be useful for Wallet include balanceChanged, transactionAdded, transactionUpdated, transactionRemoved, addressAdded, addressUpdated, addressRemoved, notification, and askFee. For Network client, numConnectionsChanged, numBlocksChanged, notification are the useful notifications. The proposed system provides a very clean separation of pieces and large-scale rewrites of one or another part without touching anything but the parts that are being redone.</summary>
