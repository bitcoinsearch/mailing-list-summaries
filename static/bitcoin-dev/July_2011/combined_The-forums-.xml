    <summary>The idea of removing the link to the forums from bitcoin.org and replacing it with a more helpful forum is suggested by John Smith. He proposes a forum that only focuses on helping users, developers, and merchants of Bitcoin without any irrelevant discussions or speculation. Robert McKay suggests moving the development project to a new URL instead of removing the forums. However, Matt points out that the forums are giving Bitcoin a bad name due to the illegal activities discussed there. He recommends marking the forums as unofficial and dissociating them from Bitcoin entirely to avoid legal risks. Nonetheless, the primary challenge in modding such a forum is the inadequate number of moderators with sufficient knowledge and experience in the subject matter.</summary>
