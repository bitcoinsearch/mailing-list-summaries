    <summary>A suggestion was made by John Smith to remove the forums link from Bitcoin.org and replace it with a forum that only helps users, merchants, and developers of Bitcoin. He suggested not having any discussions on economics, politics, or philosophical debates. The official Bitcoin forum should be a neutral place for people to adopt the technology. Smith's opinion was supported by Matt who believes that the forums are giving Bitcoin a bad name due to the illegal activities and creating potential legal risks in the future. Robert McKay suggested that the development project should move to a new URL. However, Matt stated that people do not dislike the forums but they are just unofficial and not part of Bitcoin proper, which is best for now.</summary>
