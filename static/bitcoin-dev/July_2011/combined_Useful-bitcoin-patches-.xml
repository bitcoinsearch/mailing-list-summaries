    <summary>A discussion was held among Bitcoin developers regarding potential new features that could be added to the system. Some of these features included long polling support, RPC turbocharge, hub mode, resource leak fixes, and more. Christian Decker suggested multithreading the RPC and adding Keep-Alive to speed up services, but he did not agree with long polling support as it would only benefit pool providers and generate unnecessary net usage on other listening nodes.Jeff Garzik pointed out that HTTP/1.1 keep-alive support was necessary and included in the patch. Luke-Jr made proper git branches for each logical part in the patch. However, some of the proposed features like hub mode and signal_blk_notify were deemed problematic as they provide little advantage or are targeted at a minority. The getwork_dedupe branch was considered a valid candidate for merging. Coinbaser, minfee_modes, eligius_relay, and eligius_sendfee were also discussed but ultimately not considered appropriate for adding to the codebase.The purpose of fees in Bitcoin is to prevent DDoS attacks and unnecessary resource usage, rather than supporting miners. Some developers considered the addition of txinfo and bitcoinuri features to be useless feature creep, while others found them beneficial. Multithreading the RPC and Keep-Alive were seen as beneficial for speeding up services, but testing needs to be done to ensure no race conditions occur. Hub mode was not advised due to the possibility of consuming more resources than intended.In terms of miner communication, it was suggested that miners should manually addnode each other instead of relying on the addnode function. There is room for improvement in connection and forwarding logic, but changes need proper testing and validation before implementation. Lowering fees can cause issues, and a carefully thought-out solution is needed to prevent spamming the blockchain with random transactions. Finally, developers should not interfere between the user and pool willing to do business.</summary>
