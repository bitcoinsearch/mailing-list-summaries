    <summary>Bitcoin developers are currently discussing various patches and features to add to the cryptocurrency. Some of the proposed changes include multithreading the RPC, Keep-Alive, and a resource leak fix. Additionally, the team is considering patches to ignore common misc files and allow for more fee control while preventing users from sending transactions that lock their coins in limbo.Luke Dash Jr's branch for getwork_dedupe has been tested and proven stable, so it is being considered for merging. However, some other proposed features, such as Hub Mode and long polling support, are not seen as necessary by the community and could potentially be harmful to the network. The development team is focused on cleaning up the codebase and making it more efficient before adding more features.Some other proposed features, such as allowing for different fees for relay, send, or accept-in-block, are being considered but need to be generalized to allow for more customization. Christian Decker suggests that multithreading the RPC and using Keep-Alive would be beneficial to everyone, but it needs aggressive testing to ensure it doesn't expose race conditions elsewhere in the code. He also recommends optimizing the connection logic for all nodes by default, which is opposed by Matt Corallo.Luke-Jr argues that they are already accepting lower fees, but developers are writing their software to get in the way between users and pools willing to do business. Fees are used to prevent stupid users from DDoSing and wasting everyone else's resources for no reason. The 'hub mode' proposed by Luke-Jr is not supported as it will add a built-in DDOS mode flag to Bitcoin that makes nodes connect to many neighbors, consuming more network resources than it adds. Instead, miners should manually addnode each other, and addnode logic should be fixed to reserve connection slots for addnoded nodes and tries to keep connecting to them. He adds entries to getinfo for transactions accepted for relaying, transactions accepted for the current block-in-progress, and current block-in-progress size, but these numbers have no real uses making them just useless feature creep. URI support would be nice. All of these features are available from git://gitorious.org/~Luke-Jr/bitcoin/luke-jr-bitcoin.git.</summary>
