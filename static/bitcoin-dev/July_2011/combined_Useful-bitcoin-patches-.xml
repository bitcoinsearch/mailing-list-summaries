    <summary>Bitcoin developers are currently discussing various features and fixes to be included in the upcoming 0.4 version of Bitcoin. Some of the proposed features include multithreading the RPC, adding HTTP/1.1 keep-alive support, and signal_blk_notify. However, some developers believe that it is more important to prioritize cleaning up the codebase before adding more features. They also suggest not including long polling support and hub mode as they seem to benefit only a small number of people.On the other hand, Luke Dash Jr's branch for getwork_dedupe seems stable and should be merged, while his coinbaser and eligius_relay branches may not be necessary. The Bitcoin-development mailing list discusses several topics related to improving the Bitcoin network. The multithreading of the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is considered beneficial for speeding up services, and there is no downside to it. However, the multithreaded RPC patches have only been run by miners, who have a different RPC profile than other users.Hub mode, which optimizes connection logic for nodes, is not a good idea as it can lead to aggressive connections, increasing the consumption of resources. Addnode logic should be fixed so that it reserves connection slots for addnoded nodes and tries to keep connecting to them. The connection and forwarding logic can be improved in the long term, but there is no good way to test and validate changes. The fees charged are to prevent DDoS attacks and stop users from wasting resources. URI support would be a useful feature, but there are doubts about the necessity of txinfo. The email chain ends with a discussion about fees: people want to pay lower fees, yet some developers are getting in their way.</summary>
