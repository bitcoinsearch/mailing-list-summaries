    <summary>Bitcoin developers are currently discussing various features that have been proposed to be added to the cryptocurrency's codebase. One of the proposed features is native long polling support, which some believe would only be useful once Bitcoin is cleaned up. Another feature proposed by Luke Dash Jr. is a fix that is said to be stable and would be good to merge. However, hub mode is not seen as desirable by some as it generates a lot of net usage on other listening nodes and has the potential to harm the network. Instead, some suggest opening up ports. The RPC turbocharge and resource leak fix are considered necessary additions, as multithreading the RPC will speed up quite a few services. HTTP/1.1 keep-alive support is something that big pools have been asking for.In contrast, some additional proposed features like coinbaser, gitignore, minfee_modes, eligius_relay, and eligius_sendfee are not seen as necessary or beneficial to most users. Bitcoin developers plan to pull some of these features soon but may wait until the codebase is cleaned up and more efficient before adding minority features.The fees in Bitcoin are not meant to support miners but rather to prevent users from DDoSing the network and wasting resources. Some features like txinfo and bitcoinuri may be useless feature creep. The multithreaded RPC and Keep-Alive may speed up services but need testing to avoid exposing race conditions.Luke-Jr argues that developers should not get in the way of users who want to pay lower fees instead of increasing them to prevent spam on the network. Meanwhile, the Hub mode is not beneficial to miners, and they should manually addnode each other if concerned with fast block propagation. Longer-term improvements to connection and forwarding logic are possible but difficult to test.</summary>
