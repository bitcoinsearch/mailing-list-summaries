    <summary>There have been several discussions among Bitcoin developers about different features that could be added to the system. One proposed feature is native long polling support, which would be useful for pool providers but not necessarily beneficial for everyone. Some developers are also in favor of multithreading the RPC and adding keep-alive support, while others are against this due to potential race conditions and the need for aggressive testing. Another proposed feature is hub mode, which some believe is good but others argue would generate a lot of network usage on other listening nodes and potentially harm the network. In terms of bug fixes, there is a resource leak fix and a fix from Luke Dash Jr. that has been running stably and may be good to merge. There are also several branches from Luke-Jr's repository that some consider valid candidates for merging, such as gitignore, minfee_modes, and bitcoinuri. However, some features, like coinbaser and eligius_relay, are seen as providing little benefit to the majority of users and could lead to issues like DDoS attacks. Developers are discussing how to best solve these problems without causing too many side effects.</summary>
