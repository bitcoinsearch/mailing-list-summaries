    <summary>Bitcoin has backward-compatibility issues with Wallet encryption. In version 0.3.23, Bitcoin dies after writing one unencrypted private key to the otherwise encrypted wallet, while in version 0.3.22 and prior versions, it opens but displays transactions that show only confirmation count, date, no description and a debit/credit of 0.00. When any action is performed which attempts to read keypool, the reservekeyfromkeypool() : unknown key in key pool error occurs.Suggestions were made to work around this issue, including renaming wallet.dat for encrypted wallets or doing nothing and letting old clients become obsolete. However, it was suggested that Bitcoin should not continue on as if nothing had happened when faced with unknown keys and that an agreement should be made on either Github pull request #378 or #381. The goal is to get 0.3.24 out and rolling for as much lead time on 0.4 as possible before resolving network issues. It was also suggested that wallet.dat contains nFileVersion and adding a nMinVersion that specifies "you must be at least THIS version to read this file" seems like a good idea.The Bitcoin development team discusses intentional breaking of unsafe backup mechanisms when importing and exporting. The team suggests creating an encrypted wallet and truncating the existing one in order to prevent older versions of Bitcoin or any dumb wallet backup scripts from reading it. Renaming the wallet file is considered, but not preferred.The team suggests adding a nMinVersion to future-proof the wallet file and a data structure in wallet settings that should cause all versions to crash on load instead of making a new wallet or opening in some bizarre half-state. They discuss the need for final ACKs on newenc, except for the invalid mlock calculations.</summary>
