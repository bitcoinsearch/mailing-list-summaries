    <summary>In 2011, Bitcoin developers were discussing ways to improve the security of wallet.dat files. One proposed solution was to create an encrypted wallet_e.dat file and truncate wallet.dat, setting its file-permissions to 000. However, concerns were raised about breaking backup mechanisms and the possibility of attackers packing the keypool with known keypairs.Developers suggested adding a nMinVersion to the wallet.dat file, specifying that it can only be read by Bitcoin versions equal to or greater than a certain number. Another developer found a data structure in wallet settings that could cause all versions of Bitcoin since its inception to crash on load, preventing any half-states or new wallets being created.The discussions focused on improving wallet.dat security without inconveniencing users or causing unforeseen issues with backups or older versions of Bitcoin.Prior to these discussions, there were backward-compatibility issues with Wallet encryption in the Bitcoin 0.3.23 version and prior versions. In version 0.3.23, Bitcoin stops working after writing one unencrypted private key to the encrypted wallet. In version 0.3.22, Bitcoin opens but shows a total balance of what is held only in unencrypted keys, and each transaction shows only confirmation count, date, no description, and a debit/credit of 0.00.Suggestions for solving this issue included renaming wallet.dat for encrypted wallets or doing nothing and letting old clients get mad. Matt Corallo suggested agreeing on either https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/378 or https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/381, with preference for 378. He wanted to get 0.3.24 out the door ASAP. Gavin Andresen proposed creating a wallet_e.dat (encrypted wallet) in 0.4 and later for wallet encryption and truncating wallet.dat and setting its file-permissions to 000. Douglas Huff suggested going further and said that backup scripts using the backupwallet RPC command will just work.</summary>
