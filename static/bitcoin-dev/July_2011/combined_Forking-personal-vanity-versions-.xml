    <summary>A user named Alan Grimes sent an email to a forum on July 28th, 2011 at 2:43 PM. In the email, Alan responded to those who believe there are too many vanity versions of Bitcoin by saying "nuff said." Another forum member criticized Alan's email, stating that it adds no value to the discussion and should be kept to himself. Specifically, the critic claimed that the email did not ask a question or make a statement, and was not useful. The critic also asked if there was a "vanity version" of Bitcoin that removes the use of libdb or requires users to not have its development headers installed on their system.</summary>
