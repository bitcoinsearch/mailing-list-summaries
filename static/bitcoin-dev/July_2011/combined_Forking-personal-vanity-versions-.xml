    <summary>Alan Grimes sent an email to Bitcoin users in 2011, stating that those who think there are too many vanity versions of Bitcoin should keep their thoughts to themselves. However, another user criticized Grimes for the lack of substance in his email, calling it useless and not conducive to productive conversation. The user also questioned whether there was a vanity version that removed the use of libdb or required the user to not have its development headers installed on their system.</summary>
