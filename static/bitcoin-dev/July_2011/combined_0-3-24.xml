    <summary>Bitcoin developers are considering an emergency release, 0.3.24, to address the recent flood control limit issue. The release would include sipa's flood limit fix, UPnP enabled by default, dnsseed default enabled, block send limit, and no-connect segfault bug fix. The flood control limits have become a problem again, causing slow bringups, network partitioning issues, and frequent flood disconnects. Syncing a local node is faster with the increased nLimit in sipa's code.The addition of UPnP could increase the percentage of nodes that accept incoming connections, which is currently around 4000 stable listening nodes. Linear extrapolation from the two-day lfnet growth shows that running out of sockets could happen in a little over a month. Therefore, enabling UPnP by default would be a good idea according to Matt Corallo and Jeff Garzik, although it should be clearly explained in the release notes. Gavin Andresen suggested enabling UPnP on Windows/Mac but remaining off-by-default on Linux.A DNSSeed has been set up, which dynamically fills its hostname with random nodes known to be up and accepting connections, and it is time to enable dnsseed by default. There is a need for more DNS seed roots, but there's no reason not to turn it on now.Matt Corallo suggested updating the checkpoint in 0.3.24 as difficulty has increased almost 17x since the highest one currently in there. He also shared the builds of 0.3.24 RC1, which are available at http://dl.dropbox.com/u/29653426/Bitcoin%200.3.24%20RC1.tar.bz2. Jeff Garzik agreed and tagged v0.3.24rc1 for release. Meanwhile, Gavin Andresen suggested adding another block-chain checkpoint. There was also a discussion about cherry-picked releases, and Matt recommended doing a broad-base test of CWallet in 0.3.24 to find potential bugs before crypto and 0.4. Bitcoind is prebuilt in the daemon folder on download archives, although it is unclear whether this applies to OSX.</summary>
