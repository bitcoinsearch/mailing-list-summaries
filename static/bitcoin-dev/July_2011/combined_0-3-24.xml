    <summary>Bitcoin developers have decided to release version 0.3.24 due to flood control limits becoming an issue again. The release will include sipa's flood limit fix, dnsseed on by default, and possibly UPnP enabled by default as well. DNS seeds help with connecting to other nodes in the network but there is currently a shortage of them. Turning on UPnP by default could increase the percentage of nodes that accept incoming connections as well as other P2P applications. However, some developers have concerns about the security implications of using UPnP. One developer suggested that it is necessary to ensure network stability over the next 90 days. The default will only apply to pre-built binaries, which bitcoind isn't one of, so for people running bitcoind this default doesn't matter at all.Matt Corallo suggested updating the checkpoint in 0.3.24 and building on Ubuntu 8.04 instead of 10.04 to fix up issues before release. A rather large number of parties could mine nice forks at 1/16th the current difficulty for nodes that they've sibyled. Matt Corallo did not want to spend too much time on this as it is just a minor update release.Gavin Andresen agreed with this and suggested enabling UPnP by default on bitcoin and disabled by default on bitcoind, while adding another blockchain checkpoint. Jeff Garzik supported cherry-picking and releasing either 0.3.23 with select fixes or current upstream with pull #358. There was a discussion about whether UPnP should be enabled or disabled by default on Linux. A poll was conducted to decide whether UPnP should be enabled or not by default in the GUI, but forum polls are not considered as the right tool to make decisions about Bitcoin. Although UPnP is bad for an individual, it is good for the network. However, users who don't like it can still disable listening, which is healthier for the network than leaving listening on but not actually working.It is suggested that preferred forwarding from/to to nodes that we've connected to vs connected to us, potentially improved relay rules should be given preference to reduce the effectiveness of some DOS attacks. A DNSSeed was set up with reliable hosting which dynamically fills its hostname with random nodes known to be up and accepting connections. Also, the fix to the no-connections-up segfault should be included.</summary>
