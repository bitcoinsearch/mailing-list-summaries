    <summary>Namecoin is a peer-to-peer generic name/value datastore system. It is not limited to .bit usage and can be used to map names to other things like public bitcoin addresses, URLs, etc in a fully decentralized way. The advantages of Namecoin cannot be fully utilized when using other systems like DNS and HTTP(S) as the first entry point. However, constructing a zero-trust or nearly zero trust namecoin resolver without having a copy of the complete namecoin block chain is challenging. The bitcoin lite node mechanism will not work as a peer could return stale records or no-result and there would be no evidence of their deception.Interaction is necessary for generating a temporary address to preserve anonymity through the use of deterministic wallets. The wallet-hosting entity has a private key x, with public key X. The address-generating entity knows X and generates a fresh private key y for each transaction. For each transaction, it calculates Z=y*X and asks the client to pay to hash160(Z). A bunch of y's can be sent to the wallet hosting service, which can reconstruct z=y*x for each. Alternatively, the y's can be generated according to a predefined scheme instead.</summary>
