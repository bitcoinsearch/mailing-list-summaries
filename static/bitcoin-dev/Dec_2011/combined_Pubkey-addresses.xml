    <summary>A proposal has been made to save space in Bitcoin transactions by using the full public key instead of just the address. Currently, a send-to-address puts the address in the output script while redeeming requires the full pubkey and signature to be placed in the input script. This requires more space than a send-to-pubkey where the output contains the pubkey and the input the signature. Possible improvements include compressed public keys, compact signatures, and pubkey recovery. Gregory Maxwell has made a table comparing several proposed options. If pruning is not considered, everything is better than send-to-pubkeys-hash as we have now. The downsides to op-eval2+recovery were the lack of software, but we're in an equal boat with this. Under no circumstances should the use of firstbits ever be supported.</summary>
