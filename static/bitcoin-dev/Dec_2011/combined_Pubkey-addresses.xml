    <summary>The proposal is to save space by replacing the address in the output script with the full public key plus the signature in the input script, instead of just using a hash of the public key. There are several possible improvements including compressed public keys, compact signatures, and pubkey recovery that could be proposed. Gregory Maxwell compared these options and suggested that everything is better than the current send-to-pubkeys-hash if pruning is not considered. Luke-Jr proposed that full public key addresses be required to be "compact" (length 33) and use version 21, but it would introduce yet another address type that services will have to cope with. Jorge Tim√≥n asked why QR codes are not used instead of addresses, but Matt explained that the use of firstbits should never be supported as it doesn't scale well and provides incentives for people to spam the chain to get a firstbits address.</summary>
