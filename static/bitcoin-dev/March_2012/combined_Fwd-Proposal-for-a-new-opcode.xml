    <summary>On March 2, 2012, Watson Ladd proposed a new opcode that enables scripts to be given proof that the receiver can carry out or has carried out a previous transaction. This proposal was made for anonymous transactions and Ladd is currently working on a paper discussing the use of this opcode for anonymous transactions. An alternative protocol was suggested by another person where N parties wish to purchase equal amounts of Bitcoin without the exchange being able to link their future transactions. They each put the relevant amount of gold or any other commodity up at the exchange. The exchange provides the exchanges public key, and the user provides a public key for signing. Externally, the N participants agree on a collection of non-cooperating mixers. Each participant generates a new bitcoin address, and encrypts it with the public keys of the exchange and all the mixers using an appropriate communicative homomorphic scheme. In this protocol, users validate that their address is in the set and sign the entire set. Once all involved users have signed, the exchange pays them. This requires no changes to the Bitcoin system and could be trivially implemented by anyone interested. It provides anonymity which is strong so long as any one of the mixers is uncompromised. It has very low overhead. It is not directly resistant to disruption, but if participation in an identified round requires a key provided by the exchange, abusive users can be detected and excluded.Another person asked Watson Ladd to explain how his proposal enables anonymous transactions. They understood what the opcode does directly- it just validates an opaque signature. However, they didn't understand how it enables anonymous transactions. They also wanted him to spell out why it is not, from the perspective of the blockchain, isomorphic to a hash locked transaction.</summary>
