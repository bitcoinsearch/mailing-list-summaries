    <summary>In a conversation between Amir Taaki and Gavin Andresen, the former asked how it is possible to have a 70-byte long address without P2SH. Gavin clarified that P2SH prevents long addresses by encoding hashes instead of the entire script specification, which would make the address much longer. Long addresses could be used for personal choices such as requesting people to pay to a two-factor protected account or a multiparty trust. However, using P2S (pay-to-script), where an address encodes a full script specification, would result in even longer addresses, potentially becoming unworkable. Moreover, P2S has several issues, such as being vulnerable to invisible substitution, requiring the sender to bear the fees related to enlarged transactions, creating another input vector for non-trivial data, and leaving complicated release rules in transaction outputs. On the other hand, multisig outputs are not getting packed up in addresses, making them preferable for negotiated escrow arrangements. However, P2SH is still better because reasonable anti-spam behavior by network participants may make it difficult to create large output scripts, and P2SH allows uncoupling and uniform feature sets across bitcoin services.</summary>
