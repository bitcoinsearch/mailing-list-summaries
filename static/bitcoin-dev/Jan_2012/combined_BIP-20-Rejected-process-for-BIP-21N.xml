    <summary>During a discussion about URI schemes, various suggestions were made to change "req:something" to one of the unreserved characters that do not have to be URL encoded. Options included req_something (underscore), req-something (hyphen), req~something (tilde), and req.something (period). Gary Rowe preferred Option B, the hyphen, while Andreas Schildbach questioned whether the colon sign was allowed in URL parameter names and proposed an unrestricted char instead, maybe '_'. Matt Corallo changed mustimplement out for req (required) and explicitly stated that numbers should not contain commas and should use period to separate whole numbers and fractional decimal fractions (to avoid any localization concerns). Amir Taaki raised concerns about BIP 20 being incompatible with every standard on the web, suggesting that BIP 21 be rejected and a new standard submitted. In response to these concerns, Corallo stated that the send private key is contentious and not in the original spec, so it has been removed. The possibility of implementing the expiretime field is too large as some clients already have an old implementation and could ignore the feature. Regarding the description of the "message" parameter in BIP21, Gary Rowe found it to be a bit misleading and suggested calling it "description." Corallo agreed and changed the description to be more descriptive but preferred to make as minor of changes as possible to the BIP even if it is officially only a Draft.The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 21 has been updated. The method for forward compatibility in BIP 21 has been changed, and new variables will be added either as-is or with a mustimplement prefix instead of a version number. If a client does not recognize the variable after mustimplement, it should consider the URI invalid and notify the user or drop it silently. The list of changes from Bitcoin-Qt implementation to this BIP needs to be minimal at this stage. It is recommended that additional variables prefixed with mustimplement should not be used in a mission-critical way until a grace period of six months from the finalization of this BIP has passed, to allow client developers to release new versions, and users of old clients to upgrade. There have been suggestions to use satoshis instead of decimal bitcoin to avoid issues with handling decimal numbers across all implementations. However, using decimal numbers allows them to treat the values as strings and avoid arithmetic that will confuse them. In conclusion, it is important to make minimal changes to the BIP even if it is officially only a Draft. Additionally, adding fields that restrict the validity of a URI for new clients but are acceptable by old clients could create some problems. It is recommended that additional variables prefixed with mustimplement should not be used in a mission-critical way until a grace period of six months from the finalization of this BIP has passed.</summary>
