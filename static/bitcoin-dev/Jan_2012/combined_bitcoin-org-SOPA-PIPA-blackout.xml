    <summary>The controversial Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and Protect IP Act (PIPA) bills, aimed at curbing online piracy and copyright infringement, have raised concerns about internet freedom and domain name system filtering. In addition to these concerns, SOPA contains new requirements for payment networks that may adversely affect Bitcoin services businesses and limit their ability to do business in the US and other countries where similar legislation is adopted. The Bitcoin system itself could be considered a "payment network" by the definition under the act, theoretically allowing the Attorney General's office to order miners and mining pools located in the US to not process transactions containing the addresses of targeted infringing sites. While some may view this as someone else's problem, the value of a network or economy comes from the number of potential connections it can make. Anything that risks imposing new barriers is a threat to everyone. Internet censorship is therefore a threat to Bitcoin, and users should stand up for their rights to prevent the adoption of such legislation. While informative popups may help raise awareness, many higher traffic sites are already displaying them.</summary>
