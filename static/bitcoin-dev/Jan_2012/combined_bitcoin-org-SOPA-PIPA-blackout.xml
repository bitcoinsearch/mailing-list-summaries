    <summary>The discussion is centered around whether SOPA or PIPA, policies concerning internet censorship and domain name system filtering, affect Bitcoin. While some argue that the noisy country in North America with this policy does not directly impact Bitcoin, others believe that the new requirements for payment networks contained in SOPA could harm Bitcoin services businesses and limit their ability to do business in the US and other places where similar legislation is adopted. The term "payment network provider" is defined in the act as an entity that provides services, infrastructure, and software to facilitate a payment transaction. Payment network providers must take measures to prevent payment transactions involving customers located within the United States or subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and the payment account through which the foreign infringing site would complete such payment transactions. The author suggests that the Bitcoin system itself could be considered a "payment network" under the act's definition, and the AG's office could order miners and mining pools located in the US to not process transactions containing well-known addresses of targeted infringing sites, without due process. The author believes that anything risking imposing new barriers is a threat to Bitcoin and argues that we live in one world, where the value of a network comes from the number of potential connections it can make. Therefore, any risks to Bitcoin's ecosystem must be taken seriously. Despite some people arguing that SOPA/PIPA awareness will be covered by others, the author believes that Internet censorship is a threat to Bitcoin, and if we do not stand up for our rights now, we deserve anything that is coming. Even though few people care if they can load a particular URL, the author believes that informative popups might still make sense. An example of such a popup can be seen on Wikipedia's blackout design.</summary>
