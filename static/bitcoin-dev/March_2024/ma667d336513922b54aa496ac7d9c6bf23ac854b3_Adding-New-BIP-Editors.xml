    <summary>In a recent correspondence, suggestions were made regarding the appointment of new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) editors and the organizational structure surrounding the administration of BIPs. It was proposed that the effective date for appointing new BIP editors be postponed until May 1st or later. This delay aims to prevent any overlap with the CoreDev event happening in April, ensuring transparency and avoiding rushed decisions similar to the "Hong-Kong Agreement." The suggestion highlights the importance of separating the administrative rights into two distinct roles: editors responsible for merging proposals and individuals with "product-management" style privileges tasked with sorting pull requests and issues.

The communication also emphasizes the necessity of allowing the broader community to assess the technical relevance of proposals, including the option to mark them as "rejected" if deemed necessary. A list of recommended candidates for the new BIP editor positions includes Kanzure, Ruben, Roasbeef, Murch, and Jon Atack. These individuals were chosen based on their responsiveness, knowledge of the Bitcoin stack, experience with inter-compatibility clients, contributions to Bitcoin StackOverflow, and familiarity with the Bitcoin core codebase. For the role of decentralized project manager (PM), Seccour was suggested, albeit without specific remarks on the technical qualifications of Greg Tonoski.

Moreover, it was mentioned that having BIP editors based outside the United States could enhance timezone coverage and improve the overall responsiveness of the BIP process. This approach aims to foster a more globally inclusive and efficient management of Bitcoin's development processes.</summary>
