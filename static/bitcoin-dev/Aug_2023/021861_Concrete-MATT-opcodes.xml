    <summary>The email explains the reason for referring to the proposal as "complete" and mentions that the opcode is now functionally complete. The previous attempt lacked specification for output amount introspection. The semantics are informally defined in a previous email and implemented in the code [1]. The code is considered stable and ready for experimentation. The sender plans to use their own and others' experiments to write a more informed BIP proposal in the coming months. OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY is now a single opcode, but a separate branch [2] will be maintained that includes both OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY and OP_CAT for the full generality of the MATT proposal. The email is signed off by Salvatore and includes a link to the GitHub repository [3].</summary>
