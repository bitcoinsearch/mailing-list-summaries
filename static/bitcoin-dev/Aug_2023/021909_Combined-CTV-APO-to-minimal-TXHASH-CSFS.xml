    <summary>In a recent email, the sender provides a quick update to their proposal. They mention that James O'Beirne has informed them that CTV (CheckTemplateVerify) is actually 2 bytes less expensive than they initially thought when used alone. It was previously believed that script success required exactly OP_TRUE on the stack, but now it is clarified that a CastToBool()=true value is also sufficient.As a result of this new information, the sender states that their proposal is now 2 weight units (equivalent to 0.5vBytes) larger than CTV when both are used in Tapscript.The sender does not provide any additional details or context in this email.</summary>
