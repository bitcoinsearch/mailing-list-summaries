    <summary>Daniel Lipshitz responded to a criticism of his company, GAP600, regarding its dishonesty and lack of commercial experience. He claimed that he had provided clear access to corroborate the statistics of a major client in December. However, the critic argued that claims of "trxs activity" are meaningless without demonstrating that a single client relies on unconfirmed transaction acceptance.Lipshitz further suggested a method to validate the adoption of full RBF (Replace-By-Fee) and criticized the lack of testing by GAP600 itself. The critic pointed out that their OpenTimestamps calendars have been creating full-RBF double spends multiple times a day since last year, providing ample test data. The critic also mentioned successful full-RBF replacements mined by various pools.In response, Lipshitz clarified that their research is based on monitoring main net transactions and network activity, but they do not engage in specific hashing pool assessments or research. He explained that it is not feasible or acceptable to ask clients to reveal their names and applications due to fierce competition. He also mentioned that Coinpaid's information can validate a significant amount of their traffic.The critic questioned the validity of using blockchain data to prove reliance on unconfirmed transactions, citing Craig Wright's fraudulent claims. They emphasized the importance of providing names of actual merchants using the service for verification purposes. Lipshitz offered to connect with Max at Coinpaid and share an email from Max confirming the information.Regarding Changelly, Lipshitz stated that it is likely they have not implemented GAP600 across all their offerings, as a large portion of their business focuses on servicing partners. The critic mentioned reaching out to Changelly for confirmation and information on their use of GAP600 but had not received a reply yet.Overall, the discussion revolves around the credibility and validation of GAP600's services, particularly regarding the adoption of full RBF and reliance on unconfirmed transactions.</summary>
