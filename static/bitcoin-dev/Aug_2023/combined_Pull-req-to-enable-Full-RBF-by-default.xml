    <summary>Daniel Lipshitz, representing GAP600, conducted research on the impact of full Replace-by-Fee (RBF) on merchants and users who accept zero-confirmation (0-conf) transactions. However, his research has been criticized for being incomplete and leading to an incorrect conclusion. Peter Todd disputes Lipshitz's claim that GAP600 services multiple merchants, such as Coinpayments, Coinspaid, and Changelly, who accept unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions with the use of mitigation tools.Todd clarifies that Coinpayments and Coinspaid are payment processors, not individual merchants accepting unconfirmed payments. He couldn't find any evidence on their websites indicating acceptance of unconfirmed transactions. As for Changelly, Todd argues that their website clearly states an average transaction speed of 5-40 minutes, which does not qualify as an unconfirmed payment. Test transactions also confirm that Changelly does not accept unconfirmed payments. Based on these discrepancies, Todd challenges Lipshitz to provide a genuine example of an actual merchant who accepts unconfirmed transactions and relies on first-seen behavior.In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a proposal was made to add a "first seen safe" rule to mitigate the negative impact of full RBF on merchants and users who accept 0-conf transactions. The idea is that a transaction can be replaced but must include the original outputs.GAP600, represented by Lipshitz, expressed concerns about the potential negative impact of full RBF on merchants and users who rely on 0-conf transactions while using mitigation tools like GAP600. They have observed strong usage of their service for Bitcoin, with approximately 350k unique transaction hashes requested per month over the past three months. However, the lack of impact on double spend rates for GAP600's transactions suggests that they don't actually have clients who rely on unconfirmed payments.To support their claims, GAP600 provided statistics and direct feedback from the CEO of Coinspaid. They argue that the stated figure of 40% adoption of full RBF by miners is questionable. GAP600 expects their service adoption to be greatly influenced once the default setting for RBF is changed. They aim to minimize errors and reimburse clients for any incorrect predictions of double spends.The author of the context has submitted a pull request to Bitcoin Core to enable full RBF by default. Currently, around 40% of the total Bitcoin hash power is mining full RBF replacements across 8 different pools. Some block explorers and nodes have enabled full RBF. However, only a minority of nodes relay full RBF replacements, which poses a barrier to taking advantage of them in multi-party transactions.During previous discussions on full RBF, the only opposition came from Bitrefill, who claimed to have an actual use for unconfirmed transactions. However, the author found no evidence that Bitrefill still accepts unconfirmed transactions as payment. On-chain wallets have been moving towards removing the ability to set non-BIP125-RBF transactions. Enabling full RBF by default in Bitcoin Core's GitHub master is proposed, followed by deprecating and eventually removing all BIP125 code and associated complexity in future releases.The references provided in the context offer further information on block explorers enabling full RBF, nodes running full RBF, multi-party transactions with full RBF, opposition to full RBF from Bitrefill, removal of non-BIP125-RBF transactions in on-chain wallets, and the value of enabling full RBF by default.</summary>
