    <summary>After conducting thorough research, it has been found that both Coinpayments and Coinspaid are merchant processors. However, there is no evidence or example of any actual merchants using their platform to accept unconfirmed payments. The websites of these processors also do not provide any documentation indicating the acceptance of unconfirmed transactions.On the other hand, Changelly, a popular exchange platform, claims on its website that they ensure swift transaction speeds with an average time of 5-40 minutes. This clearly indicates that they do not consider 5 minutes as an unconfirmed payment. To verify this claim, test transactions were conducted with BIP125 disabled and a sufficient fee, which confirmed that Changelly does not accept unconfirmed payments. Their exchange flow explicitly states that once Bitcoin is confirmed in the blockchain, the exchange process will begin.In light of the above findings, it becomes apparent that there is a lack of genuine examples of actual merchants who accept unconfirmed transactions as payment and rely on the first-seen behavior. This suggests that there may be no clients who depend on unconfirmed payments.For further information or to provide an example of an actual merchant accepting unconfirmed transactions, you can contact Peter Todd at peter@petertodd.org.</summary>
