    <summary>In a discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Brandon Black expressed agreement with the idea that non-expiring addresses pose a significant risk to Bitcoin users. Peter Todd proposed a solution to this problem by suggesting the addition of a 3-byte field to silent payments addresses. This field would encode the expiration date in terms of days after a certain epoch. Todd argued that even 2 bytes could be sufficient, as it would allow for an expiration period of 180 years.However, Black offered an alternative suggestion. Instead of a fixed width for the expiration field, he proposed a custom compact encoding system. This system would use the position of the first 0-bit to indicate the number of extension bytes and the encoded granularity. He provided a table outlining the number of bytes, prefix, usable bits, granularity, and maximum expiration for different levels of granularity.Black explained that while year or week expiration would typically be sufficiently granular, longer addresses could be used for more rare occasions requiring additional granularity. He also emphasized the importance of ensuring that the address format would degrade cleanly over time, even if it remained in use for hundreds of years.Responding to Black's suggestion, Todd pointed out two issues with it. Firstly, he argued that having the granularity of the limit depend on when the limit is applied would create a user experience nightmare. It would be simpler to choose a useful granularity and include enough bytes of integer to work well into the future. Secondly, Todd highlighted that Black's proposal would result in a protocol that degrades over time, as newly created addresses would have higher granularity. This would not accommodate the creation of addresses with specific expiration periods in the future.The discussion concluded with Todd's signature and a note that a non-text attachment had been scrubbed.
