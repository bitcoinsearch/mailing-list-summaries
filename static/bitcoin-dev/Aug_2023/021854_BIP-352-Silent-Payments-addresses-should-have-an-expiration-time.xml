    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin development mailing list, Peter Todd expressed concerns about the proposed expiration encoding for addresses. He argued that having the granularity of the limit depend on when it is applied would be a user experience nightmare. Instead, he suggested picking a useful granularity and including enough bytes of integer to work well into the future. For example, he pointed out that 24 bits or 3 bytes could represent up to 45,000 years if encoded as days.However, Brandon clarified that Peter may have misunderstood his proposal. The granularity actually depends on the encoding, not when it is applied. He explained that the bits used to encode the expiration determine both the byte-length and the granularity. For instance, if the highest bit in the expiration is a '0', then it is 1-byte long and represents a number of years. If the second highest bit is '0', then it is 2-bytes long and represents a number of weeks.Brandon also responded to another concern raised by Peter. He acknowledged that his suggestion does degrade over time since users would need to start using more bytes to encode their expirations after a certain period. For example, if the system is still in use 128 years from now, users would have to use at least 2 bytes instead of 1, even if they only need year granularity. Similarly, after 315 years, they would have to use at least 3 bytes instead of 2, even if they only need week granularity. However, Brandon argued that it is preferable to enable users to encode their expirations in 1 or 2 bytes today and allow for degradation in the future, rather than requiring 3 bytes from the start.Overall, the discussion highlighted the importance of selecting an appropriate encoding scheme for expiration dates in Bitcoin addresses to ensure usability and accommodate future needs.</summary>
