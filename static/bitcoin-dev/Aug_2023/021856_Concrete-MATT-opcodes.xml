    <title>Concrete MATT opcodes</title>

    <summary>Salvatore Ingala has put together a proposal for the core opcodes of MATT. The changes in this proposal aim to make the opcode functionally complete, and the implementation has been revised and improved. However, there is some confusion regarding the location of the proposal. The link provided, merkle.fun, directs to a "work in progress" comment that mentions OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY. This raises questions about whether this comment is the complete proposal being referred to. Additionally, the mention of "core opcodes" in Salvatore's message suggests that there may be more than one opcode involved. Dave, the recipient of the message, expresses his uncertainty about the completeness of the proposal and suggests that he was expecting a draft BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal).</summary>
