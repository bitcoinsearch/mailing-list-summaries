    <summary>Davidson Souza, the developer of Floresta, a Utreexo powered Bitcoin full node, has announced the release of `libfloresta` to the Bitcoin developers mailing list. Floresta is designed to be a compact, simple, and fully-validating Bitcoin full node with an integrated watch-only wallet and Electrum Server. The main focus of the project is on low-power devices such as single-board computers (SBCs) and smartphones, although it can be used in any environment. To achieve this, Davidson is writing the main logic of Floresta in Rust and generating bindings to the original code, allowing it to run virtually anywhere, including compiling to WebAssembly (WASM). While the project is still in its early stages, it has been successfully used on signet with no issues. Mainnet support is nearly ready, but there are some performance issues with bridge nodes that need to be resolved.The project is available on Davidson's GitHub repository, where he has also written a blog post explaining how to use it in Rust. He plans to write more documentation as the project matures and is deployed on other platforms. Davidson welcomes any feedback from the community.In terms of consensus, Floresta does not reimplement the Bitcoin Consensus machine from scratch. Instead, it utilizes `libbitcoinconsensus` and plans to incorporate the full `libbitcoinkernel` in the future. This approach minimizes the risk of misimplementations leading to splits. Davidson is also conducting cross-tests against Bitcoin Core to identify any inconsistencies before they become problematic.Davidson extends his gratitude to Vinteum for their support in his work with Utreexo and Floresta.Overall, Floresta aims to provide a lightweight and user-friendly solution for running a Bitcoin full node, particularly on low-power devices. With its integration of Utreexo and focus on compatibility with existing Bitcoin infrastructure, Floresta offers an alternative implementation that can be used alongside Bitcoin Core.</summary>
