    <summary>The email discusses a proposed policy change regarding the use of OP_RETURN to embed data on the blockchain. It seeks clarification on whether using OP_RETURN or segwit/taproot witness space would result in fewer bytes on the blockchain, specifically for small inscriptions. The writer also asks about tools available for full node operators to prune OP_RETURN outputs and mentions PR 2791 by Pieter Wuille, which implements pruning of provably-unspendable outputs. The email further inquires about the default setting and enabling/disabling options for unspendable output pruning and the potential impact of pruning on aiding new nodes during initial block download (IBD). The individual seeks clarification on the policy change's impact on full node operators, the prunability of OP_RETURN outputs, and the consequences of pruning on assisting new nodes during IBD.Sjors Provoost suggested sending an email to notify the intention of merging a pull-request that aims to remove the restrictions on OP_Return outputs. The rationale is to potentially eliminate transaction pinning vectors, although the author does not consider this concern significant. The email serves as a notice of intent, mentioning that some miners are already mining non-bitcoin-core-standard transactions, implying the existence of pinning vectors due to their hash power. References to further information on transaction pinning are provided, including links to the Bitcoin Operations Guide's article and Peter Todd's website.</summary>
