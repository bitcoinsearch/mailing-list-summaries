    <summary>In response to Peter Todd's accusation of dishonesty, Daniel Lipshitz defends himself by stating that the assumptions made about how he should run GAP600 are baseless and lack commercial experience, leading to false conclusions. He asserts that in December, he provided clear access to corroborate with clients, supported by easily verifiable transaction activity from a major client. According to Lipshitz, this evidence is sufficient to validate their statistics.To further validate real RBF (Replace-by-Fee) adoption, Lipshitz offers a clear option on GitHub that could provide an assessment of adoption. He challenges Todd to provide documents or public emails from hashing pools confirming their adoption of Full RBF, as he has been unable to do so.Lipshitz mentions that GAP600 services payment processors and some merchants directly, citing Coinspaid as an example. He claims to have provided an email from Max, the CEO of Coinspaid, confirming their use of 0-conf (zero-confirmation transactions) and offering cluster addresses to validate their deposit flows. Lipshitz suggests contacting Coinspaid directly for confirmation and reiterates that this is enough of a sample to validate their statistics.Regarding Changelly, Lipshitz states that they have offered to confirm GAP600 as a service provider via email. He requests the transaction hash that Todd tested, so he can check if it was queried to their system and provide information on why it wasn't approved. Lipshitz also asks for more details on how Todd integrated with Changelly, which he can investigate with them if it is not integrated with GAP600.Todd questions Lipshitz's claims by asking for concrete examples of merchants using Coinspaid and Coinpayments that rely on unconfirmed transactions. He believes that without these examples, it is difficult to believe Lipshitz's assertions.In response to Todd's request for information about Changelly's reliance on unconfirmed transactions, Lipshitz suggests providing specific details about the service so that test transactions can be conducted. Lipshitz expresses concerns about sharing specific transaction hashes due to potential retaliation against the account owners.Lipshitz argues that as the architect of a major change to the status of 0-conf transactions, Todd should welcome the opportunity to speak to businesses and users who will be impacted by full RBF becoming dominant. However, Todd questions the lack of concrete examples of businesses that will be affected by this change.Todd asks if Lipshitz can provide emails and contacts of people at mining pools who can confirm their adoption of FULL RBF. Lipshitz refuses, citing instances of harassment experienced by mining pools and their employees over the full RBF issue. He also questions why Lipshitz does not already have this data if they offer an unconfirmed transaction guarantee service with real customers.In conclusion, Daniel Lipshitz defends himself against accusations of dishonesty, provides evidence to support GAP600's statistics, challenges Todd to provide proof of Full RBF adoption by hashing pools, and requests more information from Todd regarding his claims. Todd questions the validity of Lipshitz's assertions and requests concrete examples.</summary>
