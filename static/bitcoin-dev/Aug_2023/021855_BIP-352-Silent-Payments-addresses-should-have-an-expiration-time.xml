    <summary>In response to Peter Todd's proposal regarding the addition of expiration dates to Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 352, Josie highlights that this issue is not specific to BIP352 but rather a more general problem in Bitcoin. Josie suggests that if expiration dates are desired, they should be proposed as their own BIP and be a standard that can work for various address formats. This would allow for easy implementation of expiration dates in silent payments as a new address version.However, Josie expresses skepticism about the effectiveness of expiration dates in solving the problems described by Peter. She presents several scenarios where expiration dates may cause issues, such as compromised wallets, lost keys, inheritance, inability to update addresses, and privacy concerns. Additionally, Josie argues that expiration dates weaken the value proposition of silent payments.Josie proposes an alternative solution of allowing users to revoke their silent payment addresses, suggesting that building a wallet protocol on top of silent payments would be a better approach. She also points out that expiration dates as proposed could compromise privacy and safety, as well as being difficult to enforce.In summary, Josie concludes that expiration dates are a separate problem beyond the scope of BIP352. While they could potentially be added in a future silent payments version, she remains unconvinced that expiration dates for static payment codes are a good idea considering the potential drawbacks and challenges involved.</summary>
