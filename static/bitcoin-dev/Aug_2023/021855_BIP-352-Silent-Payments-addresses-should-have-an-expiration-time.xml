    <summary>Hi Peter,Thank you for the feedback! I agree that the issue you raised is not specific to BIP352, but rather a more general problem in Bitcoin. If we do want to implement expiration dates, it would be better to propose and discuss them as their own BIP. This way, the expiration standard can work for various address formats, including xpubs, static payment codes, and future formats.If we were to adopt expiration dates, it would be easy to integrate them into silent payments by introducing a new silent payments address version. However, I have some reservations about expiration dates in general. I believe they weaken the value of silent payments without actually solving the problems you described.Let's consider some scenarios to illustrate my concerns. Firstly, if Bob's wallet is compromised with a one-year expiry, the attacker could potentially update the expiration date and continue receiving funds as Bob for the next year. Similarly, if Bob loses his keys with a one-year expiry but finds them three years later, the expiration would cause him to miss out on two years' worth of potential payments.Furthermore, if Bob dies with a one-year expiry and his heir inherits his backups several years later, the expiration date would prevent the heir from receiving payments for those years. Additionally, if Bob is unable to update his address for several years but still has access to his keys/backups, the expiration date would result in missed payments.Even if Bob regularly updates his address with a new expiry, some senders may not be able to find the updated address, leading to missed payments. Moreover, by updating his address, Bob risks compromising his safety by leaking metadata about himself.It is possible to argue that these issues can be mitigated by setting a very long expiry. However, this defeats the purpose of using expiration dates to solve the problems you mentioned. Instead, I believe a better approach would be to develop a wallet protocol on top of silent payments that allows Bob to revoke his address.Additionally, the proposed expiration dates compromise the privacy of silent payments. Observers can deduce that transactions mined at a certain block height or later were not made to any silent payment address with an expiry before that block. This undermines the privacy benefits of silent payments.Furthermore, there are concerns about the regular updating of expiration dates, both in terms of privacy and safety. Lastly, your proposed solution is not enforceable, as any wallet can simply ignore the extra bytes and send funds to the address, xpub, or static payment code anyway.In summary, expiration dates are beyond the scope of BIP352's objectives. However, if we develop a more general solution, it could be considered for future versions of silent payments. Nevertheless, I remain unconvinced that expiration dates for static payment codes are advisable due to the aforementioned reasons.Cheers,JosieSent with Proton Mail secure email.</summary>
