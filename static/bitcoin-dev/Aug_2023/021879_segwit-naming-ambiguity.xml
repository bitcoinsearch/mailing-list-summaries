    <summary>The email discusses the topic of "is_segwit" matching all segwit versions. It mentions that segwit v0 outputs are referred to as "p2wsh" or "p2wpkh". However, there is no specific term that encompasses "p2wsh or p2wpkh but not p2tr". The current term being used is "segwit_v0", which is considered a bit long. Andrew Poelstra, Director of Research at Blockstream, provides this information. Contact details for Andrew Poelstra are included in the email signature.</summary>
