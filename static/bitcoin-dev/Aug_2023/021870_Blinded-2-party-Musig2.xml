    <summary>Blind signatures are used for bitcoin transactions. These are timelocked 'backup txs' in case the server disappears. It is a 2-of-2 MuSig where two keys are required to generate the full signature, but the server does not learn of the full key, message (tx), or final signature. The server is trusted to report the total number of partial signatures it has generated for a specific key. To ensure no malicious valid signatures exist, all generated signatures for a specific key must be verified and the total number must match the server's reported count. In the statechain protocol, the receiver of a coin must confirm the validity of all previous backup txs and ensure the total number matches the server's reported signature count.</summary>
