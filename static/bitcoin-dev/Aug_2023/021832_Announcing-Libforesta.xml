    <summary>Based on the provided context, it seems that there are some interpretations or questions being raised regarding the nature and functionality of the utreexo bridge peers in relation to Bitcoin nodes. It is suggested that the utreexo bridge peers are the only actual Bitcoin nodes, implying that other solutions, such as libfloresta, cannot be used solely as nodes. This means that libfloresta lacks the ability to mine or perform regular transactions. Furthermore, there appears to be confusion surrounding the purpose of targeting web browsers for this particular project. The exact reasoning behind this choice is unclear and requires further clarification.</summary>
