    <summary>In response to a research report that reached an incorrect conclusion, it should be noted that Coinspaid, a payment processor servicing multiple merchants, is actively involved in the cryptocurrency space. This was confirmed by Max, the CEO of Coinspaid, in an email from December 2022. The email provided information about Coinspaid's use of 0-conf and included cluster addresses to validate their deposit flows. For further confirmation, one can contact support at coinspaid.com and request to speak with Max or someone from the team who can verify Coinspaid's clientship with GAP600.To corroborate this information, Changelly also offered to confirm GAP600 as a service provider via email. To proceed with this verification, it would be helpful to provide the transaction hash that was tested, so that GAP600 can check if it was queried in their system and provide information on why it wasn't approved. Additionally, if more details are provided regarding the integration with Changelly, GAP600 can investigate if there are any gaps in the integration between the two platforms.As the architect of a major change to the status of 0-conf transactions, it would be beneficial to engage with businesses and users whose activities will be impacted by full RBF becoming dominant. Therefore, the request is made for the correspondent to share emails and contacts of people at mining pools who can confirm the adoption of FULL RBF.For further clarification or to arrange a call, Daniel Lipshitz, representative from GAP600, can be contacted at the following: - GAP600 website: www.gap600.com- Phone: +44 113 4900 117- Skype: daniellipshitz123- Twitter: @daniellipshitz</summary>
