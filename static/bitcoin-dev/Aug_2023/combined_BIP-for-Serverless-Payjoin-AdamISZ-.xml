    <summary>The email discusses a protocol that is being standardized and raises concerns about the use of base64 encoding for the psk in the URI. The sender suggests using base64url instead, which is more suitable for this purpose. The email also acknowledges flaws in the protocol and document identified by the recipient and expresses gratitude for the feedback. It mentions a potential security vulnerability related to output substitution and proposes a solution using an ephemeral secret session key. The sender considers the trade-offs between using a symmetric key and Diffie-Hellman (DH) and suggests mitigating the described attack by sharing a public key of a per-request keypair. The email acknowledges the concern of relays having metadata that could be used for timing attacks but proposes a random delay based on a Poisson distribution as a mitigation measure. It mentions research indicating the prevalence of transactions conforming to payjoins and suggests considering the requirement of Tor or Oblivious HTTP for added security. The need for padding and determining the buffer size are also mentioned. The sender expresses appreciation for the feedback received.</summary>
