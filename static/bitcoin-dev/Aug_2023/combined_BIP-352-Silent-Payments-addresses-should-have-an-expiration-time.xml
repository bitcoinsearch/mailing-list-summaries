    <summary>The discussion that took place on 4th, 2023 at 7:39 PM, initiated by Peter Todd via bitcoin-dev, revolves around the potential risks posed by non-expiring addresses to Bitcoin users. Todd suggests a solution to this problem by proposing the addition of a 3-byte field to silent payment addresses, which would encode an expiration date. He argues that even 2 bytes would be sufficient to cover an expiration period of 180 years. Brandon Black agrees with the need for expiration dates but proposes an alternative custom compact encoding system. This system would indicate the number of extension bytes and the granularity of the expiration date. However, Todd expresses concerns about the proposal's dependency on when the limit is applied and its degradation over time. The discussion concludes with Todd's signature and a mention of a scrubbed attachment. The full conversation can be accessed through the provided URL.In response to Todd's proposal, Samson Mow questions the 180-year limit and suggests considering a longer timeframe. Todd counters by stating that 180 years is already a considerable amount of time and provides perspective by comparing it to the lifespan of practical electric motors and light bulbs. He emphasizes that 3 bytes would allow for an expiration span of 45,934 years. This exchange highlights differing perspectives on time and underscores the importance of considering various factors when planning for the future.Overall, the central focus of the conversation is the necessity of expiration dates in silent payment addresses to prevent funds from being permanently lost. Todd proposes specific solutions, but concerns are raised regarding implementation and the potential degradation of the protocol over time. The discussion underscores the significance of addressing this issue while acknowledging the complexity involved.The problem at hand is that wallets can be compromised or lost, resulting in addresses generated from those wallets becoming toxic data. Consequently, funds sent to those addresses can be lost forever. While all Bitcoin addresses face this issue, existing Bitcoin addresses are not intended to be reused. However, silent payment addresses are designed for multiple reuses without compromising privacy. Therefore, it is crucial for silent payment addresses to eventually expire within a reasonable timeframe.The proposed solution to this problem is simple: the addition of a 3-byte field to silent payment addresses that encodes the expiration date in terms of days after a specific epoch. The suggested duration is 2^24 days, equivalent to 45,000 years. However, even 2 bytes (equivalent to 2^16 days or 180 years) should suffice, considering the longevity of Bitcoin itself.To ensure usability, wallets should set a default expiration date for newly created addresses, such as 1 year. If someone attempts to make a payment to an expired address, the transaction should fail with a simple message stating "address expired." This approach mirrors how Lightning invoices expire for user experience purposes, despite not technically requiring expiration.Implementing these changes would help prevent fund losses and enhance the overall functionality of silent payment addresses.</summary>
