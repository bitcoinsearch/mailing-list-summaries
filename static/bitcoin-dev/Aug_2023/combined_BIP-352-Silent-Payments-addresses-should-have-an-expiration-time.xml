    <summary>The proposal discusses the importance of adding expiration dates to Silent Payment addresses in order to prevent potential loss of funds and maintain the integrity of the Bitcoin system. While existing Bitcoin addresses are not meant to be reused, Silent Payment addresses allow users to safely pay to a single address multiple times. However, without expiration dates, these addresses can become toxic if wallets are compromised or lost.The suggested solution is to include a 3-byte field in Silent Payment addresses, encoding the expiration date in terms of days after a certain epoch. With 2^24 days, which is equivalent to 45,000 years, there is more than enough time before expiration. Alternatively, 2 bytes could be used, allowing for an expiration period of 180 years.To ensure usability, wallets should set a default expiration period, such as 1 year, for newly created addresses. If an attempt is made to pay an expired address, the transaction should fail with a message stating "address expired". This concept can also be applied to Lightning invoices, where expiration is necessary for user experience reasons.However, there are concerns regarding the enforceability and privacy implications of expiration dates. It is argued that expiration dates should be proposed and discussed as their own Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) to ensure a standard that can work for various address formats. Additionally, there may be safety concerns with regularly updating expiration dates and the potential leakage of metadata.In summary, the inclusion of expiration dates in Silent Payment addresses is seen as crucial to address the risk of lost funds. By implementing a simple expiration mechanism, wallets can provide a safer and more reliable experience for users. However, further discussion and exploration of the topic is needed to address concerns and ensure a comprehensive solution.</summary>
