    <summary>This email contains various discussions related to programming and Bitcoin development. One topic addressed is the potential banning of "arbitrary data" in programming and its consequences. The author argues that if arbitrary data is banned, actors will simply encode their data within sets of public keys to bypass the restriction. Public key data is indistinguishable from random data, making it difficult to determine whether a given public key is actually encoding data or serving its intended purpose. The author suggests that unless the blockchain is padded with proof of knowledge of secret keys, it will be challenging to distinguish between legitimate public keys and those used for encoding data.The email also draws parallels to how certain governments attempt to censor internet protocols, and users respond by tunneling their protocol through something that appears innocent, such as HTTPS. Similarly, the author posits that if efforts are made to ban arbitrary data, users will adapt by tunneling their data over innocent-looking public key data instead. The author mentions Counterparty, a programming platform that has previously encoded their data within public key data, highlighting that this concern is not hypothetical but has already been implemented in practice.Another discussion in the email revolves around Bitcoin script exploits and the vulnerabilities they pose to the system. The sender suggests that the loose flexibility of the Bitcoin system in processing predicates is the root cause of these vulnerabilities. They propose two strategies called Ordisrespector and Ordislow to address aggression via the insertion of arbitrary data into the witness structure. Ordisrespector allows a regular Bitcoin node operator to opt-in or not to a self-defense mechanism by signaling dissatisfaction with the current affairs of aggression through the insertion of arbitrary data into the witness structure. Transactions with inserted arbitrary data are not included in the mempool and are not relayed. Ordislow, on the other hand, increases the coercion cost of mining entities relative to the cooperation cost by not propagating a found block unless a configurable or maximum delay has elapsed and the block contains at least one transaction with inserted arbitrary data in the witness structure. These strategies aim to minimize exploits while maintaining the current status quo.The email also touches on the topic of block sizes in Bitcoin and the misconception that storage is the main issue. The author clarifies that storage is not the primary concern and provides a link to a helpful talk for gaining more insight. They explain that even in a worst-case scenario, where the maximum block size is 4MB and the block time is 10 minutes, the growth would amount to 210.24GB per year. Considering the current cost of hardware, a 5TB hard drive can be obtained for less than $150, providing storage that would last 21 years before running out of space. Furthermore, efforts are being made to optimize the amount of data that needs to be stored by individual nodes, such as the implementation of Floresta, which utilizes utreexo to enable nodes to operate without maintaining the full UTXO set. These optimization efforts, along with decreasing hardware costs, ensure that storage remains sufficient for practical usage.</summary>
