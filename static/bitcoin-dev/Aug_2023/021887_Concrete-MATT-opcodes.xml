    <summary>Antoine expresses concerns about the potential risks of cross-input inspection in off-chain contracts, particularly regarding miners bribing contracts to censor time-sensitive lightning channel transactions. He suggests that implementing smart bitcoin contracting primitives could mitigate these risks. Antoine also highlights the common risk faced by second-layer vaults, lightning channels, and payment pools. He proposes the introduction of a matrix or set of "tags" to encode subset of introspected inputs/outputs, enabling more advanced bitcoin contracts. Additionally, Antoine mentions the need for malleability in the payment pool and raises questions about the efficiency of witness space consumed. He emphasizes the necessity of ANYPREVOUT and more malleability for amount transfer validation. Antoine acknowledges the DoS risk for full-nodes participating in transaction-relay and suggests implementing policy rules to limit CPU usage.</summary>
