    <summary>Secret key schemes, such as ECDSA, can be inefficient in terms of data usage and may be more costly for users compared to allowing arbitrary data. In the case of ECDSA, re-using k values can allow for data encoding in both k and the entire secret key. This can also be done by brute-forcing a k value to encode data in a signature, as seen in compromised hardware key exfiltration attacks. Additionally, one can attempt to brute-force keys in order to encode data in the public key. However, limiting the storage of arbitrary data in a system that relies on secret keys being arbitrary data is challenging and expensive.</summary>
