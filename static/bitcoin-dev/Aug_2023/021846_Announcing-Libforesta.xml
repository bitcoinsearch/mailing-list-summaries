    <summary>This implementation of Utreexo is indeed able to start other nodes, regardless of whether they are using the reference implementation or Floresta. It offers the flexibility to interact seamlessly with different node implementations.Switching from Bitcoin Core to Floresta does not require creating a new Initial Database (IDB). The transition can be made smoothly without the need for any additional data migration or reprocessing.Additionally, Floresta ensures backward compatibility with Bitcoin Core's RPC commands. This means that existing RPC commands used in Bitcoin Core can still be utilized in Floresta, allowing for a seamless transition between the two implementations without any disruption in functionality.Overall, this implementation of Utreexo provides a convenient and compatible solution for interacting with different node implementations and transitioning between Bitcoin Core and Floresta without any complications.</summary>
