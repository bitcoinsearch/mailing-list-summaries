    <summary>Davidson Souza has shared his project, called Floresta, with the Bitcoin developers mailing list. Floresta is a derivate of a project he has been developing for a few months and is an Utreexo powered, Fully-Validating Bitcoin Full node with an integrated watch-only wallet and Electrum Server. The main goal of Floresta is to be a compact, simple, and ready-to-use full node for end users, especially on low-power devices like SBCs and smartphones. Davidson is writing the main logic in Rust and generating bindings to the original code, allowing it to run virtually anywhere. The project is still in an early stage but has been used on signet without any problems, and mainnet support is almost ready. However, there are some performance issues with bridge nodes that need to be solved before utreexo peers can be set up.The project is available on Davidson's GitHub repository, and he has also written an initial blog post explaining how to use it (in Rust). He plans to write more as the project matures and gets running on other platforms, and welcomes any feedback. Davidson emphasizes that Floresta does not reimplement the Bitcoin Consensus machine from scratch but instead uses `libbitcoinconsenus` and plans to use the full `libbitcoinkernel` in the future. This approach minimizes misimplementations leading to splits. He is also cross-testing against Bitcoin Core to identify any inconsistencies before they cause trouble.Davidson expresses his gratitude to Vinteum for their support in his work with utreexo and Floresta.</summary>
