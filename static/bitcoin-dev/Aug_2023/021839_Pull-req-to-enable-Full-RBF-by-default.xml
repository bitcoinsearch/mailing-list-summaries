    <summary>Our research is primarily focused on monitoring main net transactions and network activity, which also applies to our risk engine. We do not conduct specific assessments or research on hashing pools. As for client confidentiality, it is challenging and inappropriate to ask our clients to disclose their names and applications due to intense competition in the industry.To validate our traffic, Coinpaid provides information that includes root addresses. By utilizing tools like Chainalysis or similar service providers, these addresses can be confirmed to be associated with Coinspaid. This verification process offers a significant amount of credibility to our data.If necessary, it is highly likely that Max from Coinpaid can be contacted based on the information provided. Max can confirm the utilization of GAP600 with Coinspaid. In fact, an email from Max in December 2022 was previously shared on this list, further confirming the validity of this information.It's important to note that Changelly may not have fully implemented our service across all its offerings. Since a substantial portion of their business revolves around serving partners, it is possible that our service has not been universally adopted by them.For further inquiries, you can reach out to Daniel Lipshitz at GAP600 through the following contact details: - Website: www.gap600.com- Phone: +44 113 4900 117- Skype: daniellipshitz123- Twitter: @daniellipshitz</summary>
