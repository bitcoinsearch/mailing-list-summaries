    <summary>In an email exchange, Daniel Lipshitz challenges the thoroughness of the recipient's research and claims that the conclusion reached is incorrect. He mentions that Coinspaid, a well-known payment processor, services multiple merchants and processes a significant amount of BTC. As evidence, he provides an email from Max, the CEO of Coinspaid, confirming their use of 0-conf and providing cluster addresses to validate their deposit flows. Lipshitz suggests contacting Coinspaid directly for further confirmation and offers to connect the recipient with Max or someone from the team. Lipshitz believes that this information alone is enough to validate their statistics.The recipient requests concrete examples of merchants using Coinspaid and Coinpayments that rely on unconfirmed transactions. They express skepticism, stating that without actual examples, it is difficult to believe Lipshitz's claims. In response, Lipshitz mentions speaking to Changelly, who has offered to confirm GAP600 as a service provider via email. They also request the transaction hash tested by the recipient to investigate why it was not approved. The recipient asks for more information about Changelly's reliance on unconfirmed transactions and the characteristics that meet GAP600's risk criteria. They suggest that if Lipshitz provides this information, they and others on the mailing list can perform test transactions to verify its effectiveness. However, the recipient refuses to provide specific transaction hashes, fearing potential repercussions for the account owners used for testing.Lipshitz asserts that as the architect of a major change to the status of 0-conf transactions, the recipient should welcome the opportunity to speak to businesses and users who will be affected by the dominance of full RBF (Replace-By-Fee). The recipient questions the lack of concrete examples of businesses that will be impacted and dismisses payment processors as irrelevant.The recipient then asks Lipshitz if they can provide emails and contacts of people at mining pools who have adopted FULL RBF. However, the recipient declines, stating that multiple mining pools have complained about harassment related to full RBF and they do not want to expose them to further harassment. They also question why Lipshitz does not already have this data if they offer an unconfirmed transaction guarantee service with real customers benefiting from it.Overall, the email exchange revolves around Lipshitz defending the use of unconfirmed transactions by Coinspaid and challenging the recipient's skepticism. The recipient seeks concrete examples and further information to verify Lipshitz's claims. Both parties express concerns about privacy and potential harassment related to their involvement in this discussion.</summary>
