    <title>Pull-req to remove the arbitrary limits on OP_Return outputs</title>

    <summary>The first question addresses the impact of a proposed policy change on full node operators regarding the use of OP_RETURN to embed data on the blockchain. The query seeks clarification on whether using OP_RETURN or segwit/taproot witness space would result in fewer bytes on the blockchain, particularly in the case of small inscriptions. Confirmation and specific details about the range of inscription sizes that would receive a discount are requested.
The second question relates to the prunability of OP_RETURN outputs. The writer wonders if there are any tools available for full node operators to prune this data from their nodes. Mention is made of PR #2791 by Pieter Wuille, which implements pruning of provably-unspendable outputs, including OP_RETURN outputs. The subsequent questions inquire about the default setting and enabling or disabling options for unspendable output pruning. Additionally, the potential impact of pruning OP_RETURN outputs on aiding a new node in initial block download (IBD) and whether the answer would differ in the case of pruning Taproot witness space (i.e., "envelopes" or "inscriptions") are posed.
Overall, the individual seeks clarification on the policy change's impact on full node operators, the prunability of OP_RETURN outputs, and the potential consequences of pruning on assisting new nodes during IBD.</summary>
