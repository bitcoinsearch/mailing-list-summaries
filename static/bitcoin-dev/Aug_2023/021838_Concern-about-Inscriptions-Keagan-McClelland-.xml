    <summary>The proposal regarding the price space in the UTXO set is a matter of concern. This proposal has the potential to restrict users from effectively managing their UTXOs, which could result in various issues such as doxing and privacy concerns. It is important to note that there are certain costs associated with having a large number of UTXOs, particularly in terms of fees when spending low-valued UTXOs. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider the implications and possible consequences of implementing this proposal. Given the sensitive nature of this topic, it is advisable to exercise caution and prioritize user privacy and security.</summary>
