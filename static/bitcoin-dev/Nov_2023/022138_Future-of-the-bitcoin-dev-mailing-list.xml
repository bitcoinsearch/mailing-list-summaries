    <summary>Dan proposes Nostr as a potential alternative to the traditional mailing list system for the development team, highlighting several advantages that could benefit the team. Nostr addresses issues such as mail server blocking, as it is not applicable in the Nostr ecosystem. It presents an opportunity to significantly reduce hosting costs since these can be outsourced to third parties unless the team opts to host a relay themselves. The archiving and web portal access are also simplified because any Nostr archive inherently authenticates itself.

To maintain high-quality communications, the team could leverage optional features like proof-of-work and web of trust-based blocklists, or even consider the "moderated communities" proposal for tighter control. These measures would allow users to filter content according to their preferences, enabling controversial discussions to persist without imposing on everyone's view. 

However, there are certain functionalities that Nostr currently lacks but would be necessary for a smooth transition. These include an email gateway for current subscribers, which reintroduces the issue of mail server blocking, and a long-form oriented Nostr client. While developing these features may require substantial effort, Dan suggests that with adequate time for preparation, the core needs of the development team could be met. He acknowledges the potential objections due to the nascent state of the Nostr ecosystem but believes that the benefits merit serious consideration.</summary>
