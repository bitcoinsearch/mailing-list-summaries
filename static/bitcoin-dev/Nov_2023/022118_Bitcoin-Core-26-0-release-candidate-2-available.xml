    <summary>Bitcoin Core version v26.0rc2 binaries are now available for download from the official Bitcoin Core website (https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-26.0/test.rc2/). The source code can be accessed on GitHub under the signed tag (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/v26.0rc2). This release is a candidate for a new major version release of Bitcoin Core.

For more detailed information about this release, you can refer to the preliminary release notes provided on the Bitcoin Core GitHub page (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/26.0-Release-Notes-Draft). These release candidates serve as test versions to identify and fix any critical problems before the final release.

It is worth noting that the previous release candidate, v26.0rc1, had to be abandoned due to packaging issues with the codesigned macOS binaries. However, it seems that these issues have been resolved in the current release candidate, v26.0rc2.

Once the v26.0 release candidate has undergone thorough testing and no critical problems are found, it will be tagged as the official v26.0 release of Bitcoin Core, indicating its stability and readiness for public use.</summary>
