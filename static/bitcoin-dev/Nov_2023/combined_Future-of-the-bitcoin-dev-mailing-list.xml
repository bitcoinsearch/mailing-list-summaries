    <summary>A decentralized email-like system using a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, such as Signet, is being explored. This system would enable emails to be sent through nodes and included in a mempool with moderators signing blocks to approve messages, which are broadcasted to all nodes. Messages signed by public keys would preserve anonymity while allowing identification of senders via master public keys. The system could also integrate hashcash-based Proof of Work to control spam and support silent payments and commitments with transparent moderator actions. Existing altcoins might be used for data storage. Nostr is acknowledged for its potential in email functionality but requires further development to serve as a full replacement. It could implement 'To:' and 'Cc:' tags for mailing list relay systems and offer cryptographic identity verification and possibly an entrance fee to reduce spam.

Delvingbitcoin.org hosts a Discourse instance that provides advanced formatting, threading, quoting, and post-moderation, but raises concerns about infrastructure requirements and private data management. The Bitcoin developer community aims to shift to alternate email systems for robust communication channels. An anti-spam fee processed by the lightning network is suggested for technical mailing lists, requiring custom software or third-party API integration. Security concerns with nostr include single-key cryptography and centralization risks due to relay mirroring; however, independence from Bitcoin Core is considered vital for the bitcoin-dev mailing list, with cryptographic signatures ensuring message authenticity.

GitHub Discussions is recognized for its engagement tools and potential integration with GitHub Actions but needs clarity on email interaction capabilities. The bitcoin-dev mailing list's future is debated, considering whether to continue under a new host or transition to a completely new platform. The historical significance of the mailing list as a knowledge repository is noted, with an emphasis on preserving Bitcoin's development records. Simple Machines Forum (SMF) is suggested for its anti-spam tools, data sovereignty, and successful use within the community. Dan mentions difficulty in developing a new online system quickly but suggests client-side moderation using PoW and a web of trust. He is open to creating a minimum viable product (MVP) for an email bridge and web client for nostr if there is interest.

Robust archiving systems are praised for facilitating efficient review and replication of discussions. The use of GitHub discussions and actions by Blockchain Commons exemplifies the use of familiar platforms while mitigating centralized control concerns. Matrix is proposed for its federated structure and end-to-end encryption. Preferences are noted for transitioning the bitcoin-dev group to groups.io or Google Groups, with Google Groups favored for stability.

In summary, potential solutions for the bitcoin-dev mailing list include maintaining the current structure under a new host, adopting platforms like SMF, Matrix, or Nostr, or using tools like GitHub discussions. The Linux Foundation preserves archive permalinks, with public-inbox instances allowing decentralized archiving via git repositories. Challenges with mailman2 highlight the need for better moderation and spam management. Self-hosting email servers poses security and deliverability issues. Web forums provide advanced features but may lack complete email integration, whereas services like Google Groups and groups.io combine email and web functionalities. Community feedback is sought on migration options, especially considering a move to Google Groups, which will shape the future communication and unity of the Bitcoin developer community.</summary>
