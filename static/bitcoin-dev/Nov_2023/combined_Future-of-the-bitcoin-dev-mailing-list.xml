    <summary>The potential of the nostr protocol as a replacement for traditional email is being considered, focusing on the need for additional features such as To: and Cc: tags to facilitate proper message delivery via relays. Nostr's cryptographic identities and Schnorr signatures are seen as advantageous over current email systems, and an entrance fee using the lightning network is proposed to combat spam.

Personal mail servers are discussed as viable, with minimized spam risks if imap/pop3 access is restricted. Services like lists.freebsd.org could be used, or new community-run systems could be established. There is a trend among Bitcoin developers towards alternative communication methods, including IRC.

Delvingbitcoin.org demonstrates the benefits of technical discussions on a self-hosted Discourse instance, noting better formatting and structured conversations. However, privacy concerns due to data collection and the need for considerable infrastructure are noted. The popularity of forums like Discourse within open-source and crypto communities indicates a preference for such platforms.

An anti-spam fee for mailing list participants is suggested, with transactions through the lightning network and custom software to manage the system. Peter Todd offers his expertise and contact details for those interested in discussing this concept further.

Critiques of the nostr protocol include its reliance on single-key cryptography, inefficient relay mirroring, and centralization issues, which pose a risk to message integrity. For more information, the community is directed to consult Peter Todd's analyses or contact him directly.

The independence of the bitcoin-dev mailing list from Bitcoin Core must be maintained, with a preference for mailing lists over web forums like GitHub due to their support for asynchronous, offline communications. For further insights, Todd's website and email are available.

GitHub Discussions is praised for its community engagement tools, including moderation, formatting, and resources like wikis and issue tracking. However, questions about its email interaction capabilities remain, which are crucial for some users.

The debate around the future of the bitcoin-dev mailing list includes finding a new host or platform that meets the community's needs while maintaining stability. The importance of archiving in Bitcoin development is stressed, with the need for non-proprietary formats for permanence and accessibility.

Simple Machines Forum (SMF) is recommended for its anti-spam tools, ease of use, and simple design, with a focus on self-hosting and efficient search functions. Its open-source nature provides adaptability and independence from restrictive data policies.

The programming community discusses various platforms for collaboration. SMF's adaptability and proven performance in Bitcoin communities are highlighted. Dan suggests content organization, client-side moderation techniques, and an email bridge to increase accessibility, though achieving all goals by the end of 2023 may not be plausible. He is willing to develop an MVP if interest remains.

The importance of robust archiving systems is underscored, with James O'Beirne's Git repository archiving Delving Bitcoin discussions serving as a key resource. Blockchain Commons integrates GitHub discussions into their workflow, using actions to back up conversations and reduce centralization risks.

Nostr's suitability for mailing lists is debated in light of its complexity and challenges in subscription, archival access, and content management. A universally accessible platform like email is necessary for broad participation. Bryan Bishop suggests Matrix for its federated nature and encryption, while also considering advanced features like "threads."

Dan sees Nostr's low hosting costs and simpler archiving as benefits, suggesting proof-of-work and web of trust-based blocklists to maintain quality communications. Nostr's lack of an email gateway and a long-form client are obstacles, but it could fulfill core requirements with preparation.

A transition to Google Groups or groups.io for the bitcoin-dev group is debated, with Google Groups preferred for its stability. While the risk of service discontinuation exists, the focus is on a sustainable solution. Following the Linux Foundation's decision to stop hosting mailing lists, the bitcoin-dev mailing list is seeking a new host, prioritizing historical content access and exploring decentralized archiving solutions. The limitations of mailman2 software prompt a search for new platforms with better moderator tools and integration features. Self-hosting poses security and deliverability challenges, and community feedback will influence the evaluation of alternatives like Google Groups and groups.io. The chosen platform will shape developer coordination and Bitcoin development practices.</summary>
