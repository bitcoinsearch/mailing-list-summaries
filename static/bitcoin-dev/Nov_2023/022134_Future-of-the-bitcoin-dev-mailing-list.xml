    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list, a critical communication platform for the Bitcoin development community with thousands of participants, is facing a hosting transition due to the Linux Foundation's decision to cease hosting mailing lists. Originally hosted on Sourceforge.net, the mailing list moved to the Linux Foundation before being handed over to OSUOSL, a non-profit that took on the task despite limited resources and a growing maintenance challenge associated with the outdated mailman2 software.

Linux Foundation has committed to maintaining archive permalinks to ensure that historically significant content remains accessible, even as the mailing list host changes. The moderators recommend augmenting this with public-inbox instances, which offer decentralized archiving via git repositories, allowing anyone to maintain their own archives and make them available online. This approach also supports opentimestamps to insert data into the Bitcoin blockchain, ensuring continuity regardless of where the mailing list is hosted.

Several issues have been identified with the current mailman2 platform, particularly concerning content moderation. The software offers limited moderator tools, lacks audit logs, and struggles with spam management due to the inability to access the server directly. These shortcomings necessitate a new solution that provides better support for backups, threading interfaces, web-accessible interfaces, and improved moderator tools.

Running a dedicated email server presents its own challenges, such as security, deliverability, and the ever-present threat of spam. Blacklists and reputational damage can severely impact the server's ability to function effectively, making self-hosting a less desirable option.

A variety of alternative hosting options are under consideration, including web forums like discuss.python.org or ethresear.ch, which provide easier maintenance and advanced features, but often lack robust email integration. Options like Google Groups or groups.io offer integrated email and web forum interfaces, with the former offering reliable email delivery and the latter being a paid service with uncertain longevity.

The moderators are seeking feedback from the community on potential migration paths, including a move to Google Groups, as they explore solutions that address both the practical and administrative needs of the Bitcoin development community. The outcome will influence not only the medium of exchange but also the coordination and unity of the developer community, with implications for the future of Bitcoin development practices.</summary>
