    <summary>The integration of a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, possibly Signet or another similar system, into email communication presents an innovative approach to message dissemination. By adopting P2P methodologies, emails could be sent directly to each node in a distributed mailing list network. The nodes would then include these messages in their mempool, awaiting moderation. Moderators are responsible for curating the content by selecting appropriate messages and publishing them in new blocks that are broadcasted to all nodes.

Each message within this system is proposed to be signed using public keys, which can be consistently used or generated afresh from a hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet. This ensures that only holders of corresponding master public keys can determine if messages originate from the same sender. The timing for block creation could extend well beyond the traditional 10-minute window, ranging from hourly to daily intervals, or even longer. Alternatively, commitments to this new messaging system could periodically be integrated into the existing Signet chain without requiring additional on-chain space, simply included in coinbase transactions.

To counteract potential spam, a hashcash-based proof-of-work system could be employed as an alternative to fee-based filtering. Regular participants who are recognized through their public keys might not need to provide additional proof of work. Their signature alone would suffice for message inclusion.

The code necessary for such an implementation is largely available, with the possibility of leveraging altcoins designed for data storage. This system would also encourage the advancement of Silent Payments by enabling scanners to identify authors of messages through their master public keys. It might facilitate sending messages with the option to reveal their contents at a later stage, although commitments could be optional or introduced incrementally to prevent misuse.

Security measures would be enhanced by including features like multisignature or Taproot addresses in Signet challenges, ensuring safe access to moderation panels without the risk of password compromise. Furthermore, the system allows for the verification of moderatorsâ€™ actions and supports various configurations of shared keys or Schnorr signatures for collective moderator approval, providing opportunities to test different K-of-N multisignature setups.

The decision remains whether to adapt an existing P2P network for handling mailing list messages or to create a new one tailored specifically for this purpose. Evaluating existing chains as a starting point is suggested, but if no suitable altcoin is found or association with an altcoin is undesirable, then a dedicated Signet-like network could fulfill the requirements.</summary>
