    <summary>Ark is a second-layer protocol that serves as an alternative to the Lightning network. It allows users to send and receive funds without liquidity constraints, requiring less on-chain footprint than Lightning. Instead of channels, Ark uses virtual UTXOs (vTXOs) that exist off-chain and have a four-week expiration period. When a payment is made, existing vTXOs are redeemed and new ones are created. The values of vTXOs are limited to a specific range of sats for enhanced anonymity. Users can acquire vTXOs from others or transfer their on-chain UTXOs off-chain through a process called lifting.To facilitate anonymous, off-chain payments, Ark employs an untrusted intermediary known as the Ark Service Provider (ASP). ASPs provide liquidity and charge fees similar to Lightning service providers. Every five seconds, ASPs create rapid, blinded coinjoin sessions called pools. Users participate in these pool sessions by registering their vTXOs for spending and specifying the intended recipients. Ark can integrate with Lightning by attaching HTLCs and PTLCs to a pool transaction. Payments are credited every five seconds but settled every ten minutes.One key difference between Ark and Lightning is how they handle double-spending risks. In Ark, users can pay lightning invoices using zero-conf vTXOs without waiting for on-chain confirmations due to its collaborative feature. However, swap-ins on Ark require users to wait for on-chain confirmations before revealing their preimage of the HODL invoice to prevent potential theft by the swap service provider.There are risks associated with relying on 0-conf transactions in both Lightning and swap-ins. In Lightning, there is a risk when opening a zero-conf channel to receive payments, as the LSP (Lightning Service Provider) can take the sender's money but double-spend on the channel if the preimage for payment is not revealed. Similarly, in the case of swap-ins, ASPs can double-spend their pool transaction, preventing recipients from being able to rely on any received funds until the next pool transaction is confirmed.The conversation surrounding non-custodial L2 payment systems emphasizes the importance of thorough testing and considering potential risks before deployment. It also highlights the differences between Ark and Lightning, particularly in terms of atomicity and the risks associated with 0-conf transactions.A participant in the bitcoin-dev mailing list discussion sought clarification regarding the claim about double-spending pool transactions by Ark service providers. They raised concerns about the impact on recipients using incoming zero-conf vTXOs to pay lightning invoices. The author also expressed concerns about ASPs replacing in-mempool transactions and potentially failing to forward payments on the broader Lightning network until the next pool transaction is confirmed. Additionally, they mentioned the difficulty of proving that one ASP is not a sockpuppet of another without locking funds or performing proof-of-work.For more detailed information on Ark, visit https://arkpill.me/deep-dive.</summary>
