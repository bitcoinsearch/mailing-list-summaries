    <summary>The p2p network is running low on connectable slots, and some nodes are appearing to be bad. It is suggested that the anti-DoS limits in 0.4 be massively increased, although this could cause a risk of lower memory systems being run out of memory. Additionally, it is noted that there are only a few usable IPs returned from DNS seeds, which slows down peer bringup for Android apps. A solution proposed is a custom DNS server that watches the network to find long-lived peers that run the latest version. GitHub has a repository for DNS seeding, but it could use some cleanup. The original backend was set up on MySQL and PowerDNS, but SQLite and BIND are more resource-friendly.</summary>
