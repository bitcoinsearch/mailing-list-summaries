    <summary>In an email exchange between Gregory Maxwell and Mike Hearn, they discuss the issue of the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network being starved for connectable slots. Hearn suggests increasing all the anti-DOS limits in 0.4 to solve the problem, but Maxwell points out that this could cause memory issues for nodes on lower memory systems. He believes that the current 125 slots should be enough and suggests figuring out why it isn't working. Hearn notes that there are a lot of bad nodes appearing in the DNS seeds, which is slowing down peer bringup for Android apps. When he tests the IPs returned from the DNS seeds using nmap, he finds that only 19 of the 48 IPs are actually usable. However, Maxwell argues that the number is much less than that since filtered IPs are also worthless and nmap can't tell if a node's connection slots are full without making an actual connection. Hearn mentions a friend who might take on DNS seeding as a project and suggests creating a custom DNS server that watches the network to find long-lived peers running the latest version as a solution. Maxwell recommends pointing his friend to the dnsseed repository on GitHub.</summary>
