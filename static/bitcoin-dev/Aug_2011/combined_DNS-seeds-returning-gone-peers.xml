    <summary>The p2p network is short of connectable slots, which is causing a problem. The suggestion was made to increase all the anti-DoS limits in 0.4. However, it cannot be done without running nodes on lower memory systems out of memory. There are 125 slots available, which should be more than enough. The focus needs to be on finding out why it isn't. Bad nodes are appearing in the DNS seeds, and there are only 19 usable IPs out of 48 returned. This is slowing down peer bringup for Android apps. A custom DNS server that watches the network to find long-lived peers that run the latest version would be helpful for resolving this kind of thing. TheBlueMatt/dnsseed can be used for this purpose.</summary>
