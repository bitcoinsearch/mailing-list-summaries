    <summary>In a conversation between Gregory Maxwell and Mike Hearn, the issue of the p2p network being starved for connectable slots was discussed. Mike suggested massively increasing all the anti-DoS limits in 0.4; however, Gregory argued that it could cause issues in lower memory systems. They agreed that 125 slots should be sufficient, and they needed to investigate why it wasn't. Later, Mike reported that there were many bad nodes appearing in the DNS seeds and only a few were actually usable. He also shared his hope that a friend might take on DNS seeding as a project, which would help to resolve this kind of problem. Matt suggested using https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/dnsseed for DNS seeding but mentioned that it could use some cleanup. Additionally, if a different DNS Server were used, it could pull directly from the database in a more dynamic way and work better.</summary>
