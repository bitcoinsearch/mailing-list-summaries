    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin developer, proposed splitting the mainline client into separate executables and libraries to simplify its functions. He suggested that bitcoind should function as the Bitcoin daemon, bitcoin(-qt) should act as the Bitcoin GUI executable, and bitcoincl should be used as the Bitcoin RPC command line. He argued that this would provide clarity to users, reduce memory usage by separating the UI and daemon functionalities, and prevent accidental launching of the daemon/UI locally. Matt Corallo agreed with the proposal to split off bitcoincl but disagreed with the idea of further splitting the client into more executables. Another developer, John Smith, expressed mild opposition to Pieter's proposal but later clarified that he was in favor of it. The discussion also touched on the need for a dev branch and protocol changes.</summary>
