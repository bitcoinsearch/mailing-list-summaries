    <summary>A proposal was made to split the current mainline client into separate executables. The proposed names were bitcoind, bitcoin(-qt), and bitcoincl. These would be built by default, and in non-GUI mode, only bitcoind and bitcoincl would be built. It was argued that this would make it more clear to the user and simplify the main functions. Additionally, the UI would no longer need to double-function as a daemon, and it would prevent accidentally launching the daemon/UI locally if you just want to send a command. However, some were against the idea of splitting into more executables, arguing that it would complicate things for little clear advantage. There was also discussion about the splitting off of bitcoincl, which was seen as a useful addition. It was suggested that bitcoin-qt could be distributed being built off of bitcoind, and there was agreement that it should be merged whether or not they have autotools. There were also discussions about switching everything to qmake, though it was noted that it was more than just adding an additional makefile. Finally, there was a call for a dev branch or something similar to allow for more conservative changes to the main tree, while still allowing progress to be made.</summary>
