    <summary>In this email thread from 2011, they discuss different attack patterns that can be used against the Bitcoin network. One such pattern involves an attacker releasing a block and a conflicting transaction at the same time to different nodes, or injecting the conflicting transaction into many places in the network at once. Gavin Andresen suggests using a simple metric of waiting for a certain number of blocks before confirming a transaction, which provides robustness against almost all attack patterns in a way that various one-off heuristics cannot. They also discuss a specific attack pattern where an attacker runs many widely distributed Sybil nodes, creates normal looking probe transactions, and detects network partitions which they are able to create. They then create two accounts at MoronBank, deposit funds in both partitions, and conflicting transactions in the opposite partitions while carefully filtering out these transactions from crossing the boundary. After the funds show up in MoronBank, they withdraw and drop the partitioning. The bad thing about this attack is that it doesn't require the attacker to have any hash power at all: they capture miners as unwilling (or willing but plausibly deniable) participants. However, the good thing about it is that it's killed dead by nodes adding in a few manually configured peerings, which don't even need to be trusted.</summary>
