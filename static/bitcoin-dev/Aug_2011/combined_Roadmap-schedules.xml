    <summary>Gavin Andresen has outlined his priority list for the next few months in terms of Bitcoin development. One of his priorities is network health, which includes detecting potential deadlocks in new code. Another priority is wallet security, specifically implementing wallet encryption and a multisign patch for trojan-resistant secure wallet solutions. Gavin also plans on re-architecting the code to be single-threaded/asio.However, Gavin acknowledges the lack of documentation for bitcoind installations for encryption and suggests creating a dedicated "core bitcoin quality assurance team" for thorough testing. Sipa had proposed redoing the locking system or reworking it carefully with one lock each for node-handling code, wallet-handling code, and network-handling code. It is suggested that reader-writer locks (boost's shared_mutex) can be used for some code.In addition to these priorities, Gavin mentions features he would like to see in the release-after-next, including fClient mode, Sipa's wallet and key export/import, moving from wxWidgets to qt for the GUI, and un-hardcoding fee handling. He also discusses research-y features he would like to see happen soon such as impolite peer detection/reaction to prevent various DOS/Sybil attacks and better detection/reaction to double spend attempts or block-chain splits.Pieter also proposed a reworked fee system for Bitcoin transactions. The system involves assigning a score to each transaction group and keeping the memory pool sorted according to those scores. The lowest scoring transactions would be dropped when a configurable memory limit was reached. For mining, the top N transaction groups from the pool would be selected in such a way that an average configurable fee per byte is maintained. As each mining node chooses a cutoff score above which transactions are included, the network should converge to a more or less fixed probability distribution for the score at which transactions are included.Nodes can measure and estimate this distribution and calculate expected time to inclusion for a given fee. However, Pieter did not have time to implement these ideas.</summary>
