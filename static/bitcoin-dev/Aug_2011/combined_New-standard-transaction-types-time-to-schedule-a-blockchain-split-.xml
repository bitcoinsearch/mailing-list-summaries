    <summary>In August 2011, a discussion on Bitcoin development was held via email. One thread discussed the concept of an address type that could encode any payment script. This would allow users to provide inputs and set outputs and additional outputs, which would then be signed. The client would refuse to pay to an address if the resulting transaction failed IsStandard. A general scheme was proposed that could convert arbitrary expressions over signature-checks (given in RPL notation) to Bitcoin scripts. The pull request posted on Github presented this scheme as a way to reduce the size of Bitcoin output scripts. Another suggestion was made for an RSA-like scheme which allows m-out-of-n signatures, however, it requires that the composite key signer has simultaneous access to all the key-parts, so it does not solve the malware problem on a single PC.The discussion also considered whether to drop the 1-of-3 and 3-of-3 cases from the protocol, but it was argued that 3-of-3 is important for group trust accounts. Some participants raised concerns about replacing hard limits with something that can dynamically adapt with the times, such as adjusting the difficulty every block based on a sliding window, but it was considered too early for this.There were also suggestions to increase precision by replacing the "Satoshi" 64-bit integers with variable-size fractions or removing the 100 confirmation requirement for spending generated coins, but these ideas were met with resistance. It was also noted that arbitrary scripts in user-facing addresses may not be practical for mobile apps since it would require pattern matching against some encoded script template, which is annoying and inefficient. Instead, it would be better to define another type of URI for each kind of transaction.The Bitcoin community is discussing the implementation of a new set of standard multisignature transactions to solve the issue of secure Bitcoin wallets. The proposed standard transactions are expected to be accepted to define a new type of Bitcoin address that allows coins to be deposited into a multisignature-protected wallet. This would require a new release that is incompatible with old clients.One suggestion was to implement or enable opcodes so that new Bitcoin addresses could be small and schedule a blockchain split for N months from now. It is thought that multi-signature transactions are a useful tool in the Bitcoin toolkit, but it may also be addressed by things like external private key protectors, which someone would have to build. Regardless, it might be useful to contact the authors.</summary>
