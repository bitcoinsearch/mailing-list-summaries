    <summary>In 2011, a discussion took place regarding the development of Bitcoin and several proposals were made for improvements to the network. One proposal suggested creating an address type that could encode any payment script, allowing users to define inputs and outputs as well as additional outputs before signing. Another suggestion was made to replace hard limits with something that can dynamically adapt by adjusting difficulty every block based on a N-block sliding window and increasing precision.During the discussion, there was disagreement about dropping the "1-of-3" and "3-of-3" cases from the code as it was argued that the latter was important for group trust accounts. A proposal was made for an RSA-like scheme for m-out-of-n signatures, but it was noted that it would not solve the problem of malware on users' computers. Another point of contention was the usefulness of RPL-encoded scripts in user-facing addresses for mobile apps.The discussion also included an estimation of byte size for different address types. Multi-signature transactions were considered the fastest path to very secure and hard-to-lose bitcoin wallets. However, some argued against this as new undefined bitcoin addresses would have to be 2 or 3 times as big as current bitcoin addresses and would be incompatible with old clients. To resolve this issue, a proposal was made to implement or enable opcodes so that new bitcoin addresses can be small. It was also suggested to support long N-address address type for multisig destinations.Ultimately, the discussion concluded on the note that incompatibility wouldn't be complete. While the idea of encoding complex transaction scripts in a compact form was discussed, it was suggested to wait for a use case for this.</summary>
