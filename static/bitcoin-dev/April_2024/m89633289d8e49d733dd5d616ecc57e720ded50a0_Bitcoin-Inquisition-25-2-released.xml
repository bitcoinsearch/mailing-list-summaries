    <summary>The latest version of Bitcoin Inquisition, 25.2, is now accessible and brings with it support for several proposed consensus changes aimed at enhancing the network's functionality. These include BIP 119, known as OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, BIP 118 titled SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT, and BIN-2024-1, also referred to as BIP 347 or OP_CAT. Each of these proposals introduces new capabilities to the Bitcoin protocol, contributing to its ongoing development and adaptability.

This update, built on the foundation of Bitcoin Core 25.2, has already seen two of the proposed changes become active on the default signet as of September 6, 2022, starting from block 106704. The third change is anticipated to be activated shortly, expected by block 193536. However, it is important to note that transactions utilizing these new features will not be relayed by nodes that are not equipped to support these updates. Therefore, users wishing to ensure their transactions reach miners must connect their nodes specifically with other inquisition nodes. This can be easily achieved by adding `addnode=inquisition.bitcoin-signet.net` in the node configuration.

For those interested in identifying and connecting with inquisition nodes, they advertise themselves using a specific subversion string. This can be viewed using the command `bitcoin-cli -netinfo 3`, allowing users to discern compatible nodes for transaction relaying purposes. For more comprehensive details regarding the implementation and functionalities of these updates, reference to the announcement of version 23.0 is recommended.
