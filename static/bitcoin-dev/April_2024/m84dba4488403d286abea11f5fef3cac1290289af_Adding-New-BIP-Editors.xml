    <summary>Steve's communication highlights a significant oversight in the process of confirming willing participants for the role of BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) editors. He acknowledges missing a prior post by Ava that addressed his concern about the willingness of Kanzure, Ruben, and Roasbeef to become BIP editors. Ava had proactively reached out to all three individuals privately, receiving positive indications from Kanzure and Ruben. However, public confirmation on the list from these individuals was still pending. Roasbeef had not responded at the time of Ava's communication. Steve expresses his regret for any redundant responses due to his oversight and appreciates Ava's efforts in facilitating the process towards a resolution.</summary>
