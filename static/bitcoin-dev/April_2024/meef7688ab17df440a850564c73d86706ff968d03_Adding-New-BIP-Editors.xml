    <title>Adding New BIP Editors</title>

    <summary>The core issue identified revolves around the challenge of managing Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) due to the current editor's time constraints. The discussion sheds light on the misconception that there is resistance to appointing more BIP editors. Instead, the primary concern is the lack of available time to adequately oversee the process by the existing editor. 

Furthermore, the conversation touches upon the simplicity of assigning BIP numbers, indicating that this task does not represent a significant obstacle. However, there seems to be an underlying effort by some to leverage the situation as a means to alter or circumvent the established BIP process improperly. This approach is cautioned against, with emphasis on adhering to formal procedures for any changes.

The necessity for any new editor to strictly adhere to the current BIP process is underscored, pending the acceptance of any proposed modifications through an official BIP. This stance aims to maintain the integrity and structured governance of the BIP process until any reforms are democratically agreed upon and implemented.</summary>
