    <summary>Peter Todd proposed a strategy for selecting new editors for a repository, suggesting that arguments for and against potential candidates be invited in the thread until the end of the day on Friday, April 5th. Following this period of discussion, if any candidates received broad support, they could be officially added as new editors to the repository on Monday, April 8th. This approach aims to streamline the selection process by identifying broadly supported candidates through open discussion. Additionally, it was emphasized that it is crucial for candidates to confirm their availability for the role and its associated responsibilities. So far, according to Peter Todd, only Jon Atack and Greg Tonoski have confirmed their availability among the listed candidates. This process underscores the importance of community consensus and the willingness of candidates to commit to the responsibilities of being an editor.</summary>
