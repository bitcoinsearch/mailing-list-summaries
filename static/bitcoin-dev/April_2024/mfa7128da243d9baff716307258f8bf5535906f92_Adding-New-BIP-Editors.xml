    <title>Adding New BIP Editors</title>

    <summary>The discussion focuses on a statement regarding the role and responsibilities of Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) editors concerning changes proposed by BIP authors. Specifically, it was mentioned that if a BIP author suggests or concurs with modifications to their BIP and these alterations are correctly formatted, BIP editors neither have the right nor the obligation to reject merging those changes. This stance underscores a need for clarity in the operational procedures and responsibilities of BIP editors.

Further examination reveals concerns about the expansion of the BIP editor team from one to six members. The expansion has introduced individuals who are relatively new to the BIP process and may have diverse opinions on what amendments should be accepted or declined. This diversity could potentially complicate decision-making processes regarding BIP modifications. The conversation also hints at a missed opportunity for refining the BIP process before enlarging the editorial team. Such refinement could have provided clearer guidelines on the criteria for merging changes, potentially streamlining the process and mitigating debates over editorial rights and duties.

The dialogue concludes on a note of resignation, suggesting that further discussion on the matter is viewed as unproductive, with one participant labeling the concern as "concern trolling." This term often implies that expressing worry is more about causing disruption than contributing to a constructive solution, indicating a contentious debate on how best to manage and evolve the BIP editing process.</summary>
