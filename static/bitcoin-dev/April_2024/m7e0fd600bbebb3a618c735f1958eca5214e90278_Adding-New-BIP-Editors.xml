    <title>Adding New BIP Editors</title>

    <summary>The process of submitting and managing Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) involves several steps and considerations, as outlined in the BIP repository's README. Initially, individuals interested in proposing BIPs are directed to share their ideas or documents with the bitcoin-dev mailing list hosted by the Linux Foundation. This preliminary discussion phase precedes the assignment of a number to the proposal, which is detailed under BIP 2. Following a period of discussion, proposers are encouraged to open a Pull Request (PR). Upon satisfactory copy-editing and acceptance, the proposal is officially published.

There is a concern regarding the potential for censorship in the BIP submission process, particularly if individuals such as Kanzure and Ruben hold positions as BIP editors. Their roles could theoretically grant them control over which proposals reach the discussion stage, given their moderation duties on the mailing list and their editorial authority over BIPs. This raises questions about the transparency and openness of the improvement process for Bitcoin.

Further inquiries relate to the procedural aspects of the BIP system, including how BIP numbers are assigned, whether copies of BIPs and PRs will be maintained in a manner similar to bitcoin core, and what expectations are held for new BIP editors. Additionally, there's an interest in understanding the criteria and process for selecting new editors or removing current ones if their performance is deemed unsatisfactory by the community. These issues underscore the need for clarity and fairness in the management and evolution of Bitcoin's technical standards.</summary>
