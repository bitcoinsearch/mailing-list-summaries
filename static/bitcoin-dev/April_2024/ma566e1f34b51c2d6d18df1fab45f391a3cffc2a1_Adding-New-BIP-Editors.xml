    <summary>The discussion revolves around the notion that involving too many participants in a project can lead to inefficiency and diminished individual contribution, a phenomenon often likened to the tragedy of the commons. This scenario suggests that when many are involved, a reliance on others to shoulder the workload can emerge, potentially leading to a lack of meaningful participation from the majority. This not only detracts from the overall process but can also result in burnout among the few who end up carrying the brunt of the work. The expectation mismatch regarding time commitment and actual involvement is highlighted as a core issue stemming from an overly inclusive approach to team composition.

A more moderate strategy in selecting team members is advocated for, with an emphasis on starting with a smaller, more manageable number of participants. This approach is seen as beneficial, providing flexibility to adjust the team size based on actual workload and helping prevent a scenario where individuals join with the intention of contributing minimally. Specifically, the suggestion is to initially include three additional people, with Murch, Kanzure, and Ruben being identified as ideal candidates due to their proven track record. This recommendation reflects a strategic choice aimed at fostering a productive and committed team dynamic from the outset.</summary>
