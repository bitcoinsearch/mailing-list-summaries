    <summary>The email from Antoine addresses the inherent challenges and expectations associated with managing and contributing to open-source projects, particularly those governed by long-standing IETF and BIP standards. Antoine articulates that aspiring contributors seeking permissions within these open-source commons should be prepared to address public objections, a scenario that may seem daunting but is considered part of the engagement process within the community. This dialogue underscores the premise that involvement in open-source projects is not solely about technical contributions but also involves navigating and responding to the community's ethical and integrity standards.

Moreover, Antoine emphasizes the importance of ethics and personal integrity for individuals seeking to obtain permissions to contribute to these projects. He suggests that these values serve as essential checks and balances for those tasked with privileged actions. To support this point, he recommends consulting the ACM Code of Ethics ([ACM Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics)) as a resource for guidance on ethical conduct within the realm of permissions and open-source contribution. Although he acknowledges that ethics are a dynamic concept, the ACM Code offers a foundational framework for ethical decision-making in complex scenarios.

Additionally, Antoine proposes a mechanism for maintaining an active and engaged set of maintainers or editors for open-source projects. He suggests that periodically reviewing the activity levels of long-serving members and potentially replacing those with minimal contributions could foster renewed vitality and innovation within the project. This approach would not only ensure sustained contributions but also open opportunities for new participants to bring fresh perspectives. Antoine clarifies that this process does not preclude ongoing discussions about improving the governance and contribution mechanisms, indicating a commitment to continuous improvement and inclusivity within the open-source community.</summary>
