    <title>Adding New BIP Editors</title>

    <summary>The ongoing issues with the BIP repository have been a significant point of frustration for a considerable time, prompting the addition of Kalle as an extra editor three years prior. Moreover, the BINANA repository was established by AJ nearly three months ago to address these concerns. The primary intention behind proposing a casual suggestion was to catalyze progress on this matter, without a strict adherence to a specific timeline. However, it is emphasized that any objections to proposals should be accompanied by viable and concrete alternatives to prevent stagnation.

To address concerns regarding the timeline for resolving these issues, a proposal has been made to extend the deadline for soliciting comments on potential editor candidates until April 19th, with the aim of appointing additional editors by April 22nd. This adjustment ensures the comment period concludes after the upcoming Core Dev meeting, providing ample time for thorough consideration and discussion. It is crucial for suggestions relating to the objectionable timeline to not only highlight the issues but also present alternative timelines or solutions to facilitate progress.

Furthermore, it is acknowledged that discussions regarding the addition of new editors and the modification of the editorial process are distinct matters that should be addressed separately. This separation ensures clarity and focus in deliberations, allowing for more effective resolution of each issue.</summary>
