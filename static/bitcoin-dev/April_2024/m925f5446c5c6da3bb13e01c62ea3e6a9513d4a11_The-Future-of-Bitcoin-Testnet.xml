    <summary>In a recent discussion within the bitcoin development community, there was an inquiry regarding the establishment of a new test network, referred to as "testnet4." The central question posed was whether this new network iteration would necessitate a distinct default TCP port number, given its status as a separate network. This query underscores the ongoing efforts within the bitcoin ecosystem to evolve and refine its testing environments, ensuring they remain effective for developmental purposes. Such discussions are pivotal for the seamless operation and future scalability of the network, highlighting the community's dedication to maintaining robust and efficient frameworks for testing and development.</summary>
