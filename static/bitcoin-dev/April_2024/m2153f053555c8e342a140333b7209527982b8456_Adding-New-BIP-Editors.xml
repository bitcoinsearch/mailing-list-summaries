    <summary>The email from Juan Galt emphasizes the significance of having multiple editors in the process of reviewing Bitcoin core code and documentation. Galt expresses his support for Jon Atack and Kanzure, highlighting their contributions and expertise in the field. He specifically notes Jon Atack's extensive experience with copy editing, documentation, and review related to Bitcoin core code. Galt also acknowledges the value of following the works of these contributors closely, despite not being an active participant himself. He agrees with NVK on the point that increasing the number of editors can alleviate potential bottlenecks in the process, suggesting a broader collaborative effort could enhance the development and oversight of Bitcoin's core components.</summary>
