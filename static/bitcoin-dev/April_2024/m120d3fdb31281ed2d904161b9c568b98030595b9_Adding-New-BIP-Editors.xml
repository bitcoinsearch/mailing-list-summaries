    <summary>Michael Folkson proposed a new method for assigning BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) numbers aimed at streamlining the process and enhancing documentation quality. The suggestion includes using a bot to assign temporary numbers to new pull requests marked with "NEW:" in their title. These temporary numbers would be based on the GitHub pull request number, prefixed with a 'B'. This system allows for an organized review process by BIP editors and provides authors with a stable reference number while their pull request remains open. Upon merging a pull request, a permanent BIP number will be assigned, maintaining relevance for both temporary and permanent numbers to facilitate easy tracking of documentation.

Additionally, Folkson highlighted potential uses of continuous integration (CI) tools to further improve the BIP process. Suggestions include automating grammar checks upon the opening or reopening of pull requests and publishing a copy of the BIP as a torrent or nostr event once the pull request is merged. These enhancements aim to ensure the high quality and accessibility of BIP documentation.

The communication also included endorsements for Kanzure, Ruben, Roasbeef, Murch, and Jonatack as BIP editors, entrusting them with all privileges and responsibilities as outlined in BIP 2. In case no specific guidance on assigning BIP numbers is provided, there is support for the new editors to develop their own numbering scheme and start assigning new BIP numbers. This approach addresses concerns about the current bottlenecks in proposal numbering and emphasizes the importance of moving forward with improvements to the BIP process.</summary>
