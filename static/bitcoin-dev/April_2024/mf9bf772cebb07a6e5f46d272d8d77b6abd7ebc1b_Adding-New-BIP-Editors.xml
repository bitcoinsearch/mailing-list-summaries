    <summary>The correspondence brings to light the current operational approach of Core maintainers, specifically addressing the opacity surrounding the processes of onboarding new maintainers and making merge decisions. It suggests that these activities, which significantly affect Core users and the broader community, are being conducted privately, away from public scrutiny. The message proposes a shift towards more transparency and openness in these processes, especially for Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) editors. It argues for the public declaration and discussion of disagreements or areas requiring personal judgment, rather than handling them behind closed doors. This change aims at enhancing the visibility of decision-making processes and fostering a more inclusive environment for community participation and feedback.</summary>
