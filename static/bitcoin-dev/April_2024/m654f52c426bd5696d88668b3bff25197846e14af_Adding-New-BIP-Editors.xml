    <summary>Following the deadline of April 19th, an update regarding the selection of Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) editors has been shared. The process did not encounter any objections to the nominees nor suggestions for selecting a subset from them since the last communication. This lack of opposition or alternative proposals has led to a rough consensus among the community. Consequently, Kanzure, Murch, Jonatack, Ruben, and Roasbeef have been confirmed to be added as BIP editors. Their official inclusion in this role is scheduled for Monday, April 22nd. This development is significant for the Bitcoin Development community as it moves forward with these new appointments.</summary>
