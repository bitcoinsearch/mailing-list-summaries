    <summary>The release of Bitcoin Core version v27.0 marks a significant update in the Bitcoin network, incorporating new features, various bug fixes, performance improvements, and updated translations. This version is now readily accessible for download from [bitcoincore.org](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-27.0/) or through BitTorrent, offering users multiple avenues to access the latest enhancements in Bitcoin Core's functionality. Users are encouraged to report any bugs encountered using the issue tracker on GitHub, ensuring the continuous improvement and stability of the Bitcoin network.

For those upgrading from an older version, it's crucial to shut down the existing software completely before proceeding with the installation process. This ensures a smooth transition, especially when migrating from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its end-of-life (EOL). The software maintains support for old wallet versions, facilitating user transitions without sacrificing accessibility or security. Compatibility extends across various operating systems, including Linux Kernel 3.17+, macOS 11.0+, and Windows 7 and newer, though it is advised against using Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems due to potential security risks.

Among the notable changes in this release is the deprecation of libbitcoinconsensus, slated for removal in version v28. This library, despite its nearly decade-long presence, has seen minimal uptake and has become a maintenance burden. Future releases will introduce libbitcoinkernel to offer a more robust API capable of validating transactions and blocks with full awareness of the UTXO set. Additionally, the mempool.dat file sees a format change to enhance security against external modifications, with a temporary setting available for those wishing to revert to the legacy format.

Significant updates also include the default enabling of BIP324 v2 transport, streamlining manual connection options to default to v2 but allowing for fallbacks to v1 if necessary. Adjustments have been made to remove network-adjusted time from consensus code, emphasizing the importance of accurate system time for node operators. The introduction of Opt-in Topologically Restricted Until Confirmation (TRUC) Transactions policy represents a step forward in managing transaction and fee policies within the network.

Moreover, external signing support on Windows has been temporarily disabled, pending dependency updates, while build requirements have been updated to necessitate a C++20 capable compiler. The Wallet function introduces the CoinGrinder coin selection algorithm to optimize transaction costs at high feerates, alongside adjustments to the Branch And Bound algorithm and descriptor birth times to improve transaction efficiency and accuracy.

Low-level changes, such as pruning enhancements during initial block download and fixes to prevent file deletion issues, contribute to the overall stability and performance of Bitcoin Core. The release culminates with acknowledgments to the numerous contributors who played a pivotal role in its development, showcasing the collaborative effort driving the evolution of the Bitcoin ecosystem.</summary>
