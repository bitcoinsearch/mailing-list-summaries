    <summary>The latest version of Bitcoin Core, 26.1, has been officially released and is now available for users to download from the [Bitcoin Core website](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-26.1/) or via BitTorrent with a provided magnet link. This new release brings several bug fixes and performance enhancements that aim to improve the user experience. It introduces updated translations and advises users upgrading from older versions to properly shut down their current software before installing the update. This precaution is particularly important for those moving from versions that are no longer supported, as it may involve migrating the data directory, although it supports older wallet versions.

Compatibility for the new Bitcoin Core version spans across multiple operating systems, including Linux kernel-based systems, macOS versions 11.0 and newer, and Windows 7 and upwards. While it may function on other Unix-like systems, running the software on unsupported platforms is generally discouraged due to limited testing and potential compatibility issues. The update includes significant improvements in wallet functionality—specifically for descriptor wallets—by refining transaction scanning and keypool management. It also addresses various RPC-related issues, such as `getrawtransaction` segfaults and problems with `.cookie` file retention, alongside enhancing P2P and network operations, like I2P session creation and block processing protocols.

From a development standpoint, version 26.1 focuses on increasing the stability and security of Bitcoin Core. This includes implementing a hardened runtime environment for macOS builds and making specific adjustments to build options. The continuous integration (CI) process has been updated to ensure more reliable operation across different environments by addressing unrelated failures and resolving job-specific problems. The successful release of version 26.1 underscores the collective effort of the Bitcoin Core development community, comprising developers dedicated to core functionalities, testing, and translation efforts, all contributing to the software's reliability and efficiency.</summary>
