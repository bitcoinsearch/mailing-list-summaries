    <summary>The email exchange between Tom and the sender revolves around a discussion related to size numbers and the inclusion of a definition in the BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal). The sender expresses interest in having size numbers, specifically in comparison to plain text and gzip. They also suggest adding a definition to the BIP that clarifies when it is not advisable to use height/index due to the risk of reorganizations, similar to what was done in BIP136.</summary>
