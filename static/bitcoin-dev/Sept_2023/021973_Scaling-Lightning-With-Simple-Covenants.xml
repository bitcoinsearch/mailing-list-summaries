    <summary>John sent an email to ZmnSCPxj acknowledging that the design given in the figures in the paper, along with the accompanying descriptions, is correct. However, he points out that there was an error in the quoted text and agrees that it needs to be corrected. John informs ZmnSCPxj that he has created a new version of the paper [1], which includes this fix. He also mentions that the updated version provides more detail on the use of hierarchical channels during passive rollovers, specifically at the end of Section 4.9. John concludes the email by thanking ZmnSCPxj for pointing out the correction.</summary>
