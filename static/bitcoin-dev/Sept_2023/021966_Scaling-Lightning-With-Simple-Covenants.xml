    <summary>The email discusses a change in the trust model from trustless to a federated one, which leads to an increase in the on-chain footprint of failure. The author does not provide specific details about the context or the reasons behind this change. However, it can be inferred that the transition to a federated trust model may have implications for security and decentralization. Unfortunately, without further information, it is challenging to provide a more detailed summary.</summary>
