    <summary>The email discusses the Prometheus protocol, which is a protocol for high-load computing on top of Bitcoin. The protocol operates as a multi-party game setting where an oracle ("worker") is given a computationally complex task and the network reaches a consensus on whether the result reported by the worker is true. The consensus is achieved through optional rounds of verification and arbitrage. It is important to note that the protocol is cryptoeconomically-safe and has a proven Nash equilibrium.The Prometheus protocol can be used to build a trustless 2-way peg on the Bitcoin blockchain without any soft forks. In this case, the "worker" acts as an oracle for some extra bitcoin system, such as a sidechain or zk rollup, validating its state. The protocol enables the two-way trustless transfer of Bitcoins between the Bitcoin blockchain, RGB, and potentially a new layer 1 called "prime".The email also mentions that the Prometheus protocol was transferred to LNP/BP Standards Association and is part of their backlog for potential future use as a layer on top of Bitcoin. It is worth noting that the protocol works on Bitcoin, requiring only several Bitcoin transactions per task, and does not require any soft fork. All economic settings are done with Bitcoin as a means of payment, utilizing existing Bitcoin script capabilities.To learn more about the potential new layer 1 called "prime", the email suggests checking out Dr. Maxim Orlovsky's Baltic Honeybadger talk. The email concludes with contact information for Dr. Maxim Orlovsky and the LNP/BP Standards Association.</summary>
