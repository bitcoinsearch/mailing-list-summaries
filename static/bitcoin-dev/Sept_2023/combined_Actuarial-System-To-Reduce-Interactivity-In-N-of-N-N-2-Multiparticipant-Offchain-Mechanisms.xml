    <summary>The email discusses the issue of participant non-interactivity in Zeeman 40 and its impact on the actuary's R reveals. The concern is that a new off-chain state, N1', with a different group of participants may reuse the R reveals from the previous state, N1, which poses a security risk to the actuary bond. To address this, the suggestion is that the R reveal should only occur once all group participants have revealed their own signatures.Additionally, the email mentions an assumption of loose interactivity, where all non-actuary participants must be online simultaneously. This lack of contribution is attributed to a "flat" off-chain construction without layering of promised off-chain outputs in subgroups to reduce novation interactivity.On a more fundamental level, the email points out that the actuarial system does not solve the problem of "multi-party off-chain state correction" as there is no guarantee that the actuary will not slash the bond itself. Furthermore, if the bond is guarded by users' public keys, there is no assurance that the user will cooperate after the actuary commits equivocation and signs a "fair" slashing transaction.In summary, the email highlights concerns regarding participant non-interactivity, security risks to the actuary bond, the assumption of loose interactivity, the lack of multi-party off-chain state correction, and uncertainties surrounding the actuary's actions and user cooperation.Moving on to the concept of off-chain mechanisms in blockchain technology, the email explains that users can go offline and then come online to synchronize and broadcast transactions to the mempool, which are then confirmed by miners. However, this becomes challenging in off-chain mechanisms like Lightning channels, where users need to be always online. To address this, the sender proposes a solution called the actuary role, similar to miners in the blockchain, who only decide transaction ordering without having custody of funds.To enable the actuary role, two softforks, `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT` and `OP_CHECKSEPARATEDSIG`, are suggested. The advantages of using an N-of-N signatory set in off-chain mechanisms are discussed, providing consensus and preventing a majority from forcing movement of funds against a participant's will. However, all participants need to be online to sign a new state, which stalls the protocol if one participant is offline.The email introduces the concept of an off-chain "mempool," where the state of the mechanism is considered as pairs of Bitcoin SCRIPT and satoshis, represented as actual transaction outputs. Participants can create transactions within the current state and send money to each other, but these transactions remain unconfirmed until they are signed off by all participants.To address the confirmation issue without custodianship, the sender suggests adding the actuary to the contract controlling the funds with a specific R value, preventing R reuse and enforcing single-spend. This ensures non-custodiality while maintaining an N-of-N requirement for spending.The desired properties for the actuary role are highlighted, including the ability to select one transaction, inability to spend funds unilaterally or hold them hostage, and the assurance that participants can drop the mechanism onchain and recover their funds if the actuary stops responding. A suggested method to ensure these properties is infecting the SCRIPT of all outputs with "(sign-only-once(M) || CSV) &amp;&amp; C".The email also discusses `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT` in Bitcoin transactions and its relationship to the actuary role. With `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT`, participants can confirm transactions "confirmed" by the actuary even if the actual transaction ID changes.An example is provided with three participants (A, B, C) and an actuary (M). Each participant has a base contract, and the actuary signs transactions using a fixed R nonce. When A wants to send money to B, they create a transaction with two new outputs. A solicits a single-spend signature from the actuary to ensure B's assurance against double-spending. If dropped onchain, the confirmed transaction can be immediately confirmed onchain as well.To update the state of the mechanism, the actuary proposes a new state to each participant. Participants only need to validate expected outputs, reducing bandwidth requirements and providing a scaling advantage. All participants must sign off on each state update, preventing invalid states and dropping the current state onchain if needed.Custodial solutions are avoided in this design to minimize control over coins. The actuary role only confirms transactions and cannot move funds without consent, ensuring consensus from all participants. Participants can go offline and online while the actuary coordinates new states.</summary>
