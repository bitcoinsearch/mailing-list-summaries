    <summary>The email discusses the concept of cut-through in blockchain transactions. It states that if cut-through is used in a transaction where there is only one transaction from "Alice" to "Zack", it can be beneficial in terms of scaling. However, in other cases where all transactions are included and only a proof is created for some nodes, it doesn't scale well because the transactions in the middle still need to be processed. Cut-through is only necessary during batching to prevent double-spending. The email also mentions that if full-RBF (Replace-By-Fee) is enabled, transactions will be replaced, leading to mempool-level-batching in the future. No further information is provided beyond this point.</summary>
