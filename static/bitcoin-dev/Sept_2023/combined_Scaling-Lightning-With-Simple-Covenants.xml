    <summary>The email discusses the tradeoff between trust and capital efficiency in the context of the Lightning Network. It raises concerns about the classification of users as "casual" or "dedicated" and designing protocols accordingly. The author argues that trust assumptions in Lightning are more complex than a simple dichotomy, with various choices and dependencies involved.The proposal introduces different scaling notions to measure the performance of off-chain constructions. These include onboarding scaling, which determines how many users can coexist off-chain, transactional scaling, which defines the number of transfers that can be performed off-chain per on-chain transaction, and user resource scaling, which quantifies the resources a user should mobilize to make a trust-minimized usage of the off-chain construction.The email questions whether the proposal adequately considers all dimensions of scalability and highlights the potential challenges and uncertainties in its design. It mentions the possibility of creating a radixpool with Musig2, but notes the lack of an N-party update mechanism for rebalancing channels internally. The coordination problem of adding or removing users from the group and updating their channels is also identified.Furthermore, the email points out the uncertainty and potential issues with routing funds in a network where intermediate hops can withhold HTLCs until the timeout-tree matures in favor of the dedicated user. It questions the guarantee of immediate accessibility of funds and the need for corrective actions in case of failures or delays.The fault-tolerance of the proposed off-chain construction is highlighted as a significant concern, particularly if one user becomes unresponsive. The email suggests that relying on legal and normal custody policies may be preferable to burdening the UTXO set with potential failures.Another point raised in the email is the increased cost of enforcement in the proposed approach, which could involve multiple transactions instead of just one or two. This raises questions about capital efficiency and how much enforcement is enough.Overall, the email raises important considerations and questions about the tradeoff between trust and scalability in the Lightning Network. It highlights the complexity of designing protocols that cater to different user types and addresses scalability challenges while ensuring trust-minimized usage. The author suggests further exploration of different scaling notions and optimization strategies to improve the performance and fault-tolerance of off-chain constructions.</summary>
