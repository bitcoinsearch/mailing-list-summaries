    <summary>Cut-through transactions will not have a significant impact on inscriptions, despite the ability to prove chains using fancy cryptography. The fact remains that transactions like Alice -&gt; Bob -&gt; Zack are still present in the blockchain and can be accessed by anyone running a full archival node. These nodes contain all the inscription data and can provide it to those who need it. Similar to Bitcoin, where some people run pruned nodes without archival inscription data, this does not prevent others from running full archival nodes and making the data available.
