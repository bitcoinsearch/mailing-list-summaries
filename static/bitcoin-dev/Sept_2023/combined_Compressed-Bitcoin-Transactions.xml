    <summary>Tom has posted about a compression schema he has been working on for bitcoin transactions. The schema is designed for transmission through steganography, satellite broadcasting, and other low bandwidth channels with high CPU availability on decompression. Tom mentions that the compression schema is tailored for the most common transactions single parties are likely to make, and it ensures that no transaction becomes malformed or corrupted. He also provides a link to a pull request (PR) for implementing this schema. Andrew, the Director of Research at Blockstream, responds to Tom's post, requesting him to put together a chart with size numbers to demonstrate the strength of this compression. Andrew acknowledges that analyzing "average" transactions might not yield great numbers and suggests including uncompressed/compressed sizes for "optimum" transactions, such as a 2-in-2-out wpkh transaction and a 2-in-2-out Taproot transaction. He also suggests including numbers for p2sh-wpkh and p2pkh transactions, although they are less common and less interesting.</summary>
