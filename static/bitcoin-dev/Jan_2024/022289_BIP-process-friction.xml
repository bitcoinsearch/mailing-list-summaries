    <summary>Over the past three years, there has been an ongoing issue within the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) repository, specifically concerning the difficulty of getting BIPs merged. Kalle joined Luke as a BIP editor, yet despite this addition, several pull requests (PRs) remain unmerged for extended periods, such as PR 1408 on Ordinal Numbers, PR 1489 on Taproot Assets Protocol, and PR 1500 on OP_TXHASH, each with numerous comments from the editors. The scope of acceptable BIPs appears to be narrowing, excluding mempool/relay policy, which has been deemed out of scope.

Furthermore, only one of the editors, Luke, is currently able to assign new numbers to BIPs. There have also been delays brought about by demands for backwards compatibility sections from the editors, regardless of the authors' perspectives on their necessity. Additionally, the process of deciding whether to allow markdown as a text format has become a drawn-out affair due to confusion regarding the procedure.

The current state of the BIPs repository could be described as functional, albeit with a high level of friction. This friction has impacted recent proposals, leading to open PRs against inquisition. The author of the email, aj, had previously directed people to write a BIP and used BIP numbers to signal activation. However, the inefficiency of the process has prompted a change in direction. Aj has now created a separate system akin to IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority), named "numbers and names" (BINANA), to link numbers to specifications without relying on the BIPs process. The BINANA repository is hosted on GitHub and is open to bitcoin-related proposals, even those that aj personally disagrees with on merit.

Aj suggests that the BIPs repo would benefit from reform to operate more effectively but has declined to take on this challenge themselves. They also humorously note that the acronym BINANA amuses them and may serve as an authoritative dictionary for terms used within inquisition in the future.</summary>
