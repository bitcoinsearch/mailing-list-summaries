    <summary>The discussion opens with an acknowledgment of the complexities surrounding the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process, particularly in relation to default policy changes within Bitcoin Core and other implementations. It is highlighted that while consensus rules carry an implied obligation due to the risk of network splits if not followed, policy rules do not bear the same weight. Despite this, the draft acknowledges the importance of standardizing recommendations for policy rules through a specification process. This is suggested to be beneficial not only for those proposing changes but also for reviewers, including developers from Lightning and multiparty protocols.

The email brings into question whether proposed default policy changes ought to be formalized as BIPs. The author argues that doing so would prevent the stunting of work on these proposals and improve the ability of individuals to track the progression of such proposalsâ€”something the author has found challenging without clear reference points. It is noted that some consensus change BIPs are beginning to include sections on policy, which could be more effectively addressed by referencing separate policy BIPs instead of combining them within a single document. 

In conclusion, the email seeks to open a dialogue on the potential modification of the approach to policy changes within the BIP framework. The author appreciates the recipient's longstanding contributions to maintaining high standards within the BIP editing process, acknowledging the effort involved and the potential negative outcomes that have been avoided as a result.
