    <title>CheckTemplateVerify Does Not Scale Due to UTXO's Required For Fee Payment</title>

    <summary>CheckTemplateVerify (CTV) is a proposed Bitcoin covenant opcode that makes a commitment to the transaction which will spend a particular output. It specifies details like the number of inputs and outputs, as well as the outputs hash. CTV is anticipated to be primarily used with anchor outputs for fee payment or by creating an input in a separate transaction to include in the CTV-committed transaction. However, these methods could lead to scalability issues since they require users to manage additional UTXOs solely for fee payments. This requirement undermines the efficiency gains from UTXO sharing schemes that CTV aims to facilitate.

To maintain self-sovereignty within reactive security protocols like Lightning Network, users must ensure transactions are mined within deadlines, which necessitates fee payments. The dependency on extra UTXOs for fee payments essentially forces each user to maintain another UTXO, contradicting the purpose of shared UTXO schemes. A possible workaround involves third-party fee payments, such as through a Lightning Network payment, but this compromises mining decentralization and is less efficient than paying fees directly.

The recommendation is to stop further development of CTV in its current form due to its inherent design flawsâ€”referred to as a "design foot-gun." Instead, it's suggested that new covenant schemes should be created that are compatible with replace-by-fee features, eliminating the need for additional UTXOs and enhancing on-chain efficiency.
