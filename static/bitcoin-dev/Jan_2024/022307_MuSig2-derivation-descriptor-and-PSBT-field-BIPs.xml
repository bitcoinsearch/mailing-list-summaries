    <summary>Tim Ruffing, during an online London Bitcoin Devs meetup in 2022, addressed the issue of x-only public keys' complexity within advanced cryptographic schemes such as MuSig2. He noted that while these schemes often involve key tweaking— a process integral to both Taproot and MuSig2's key aggregation—the absence of the explicit bit representing the public key's sign can lead to complications in drafting specifications. Although this omission does not pose a security threat, it introduces engineering challenges that might not justify the byte saved by using x-only public keys. Reflecting on the decision to implement x-only public keys, Ruffing expressed an understanding of the perspectives both for and against it, recognizing the trade-off between byte savings and increased engineering complexity.

Michael Folkson conveyed this information, emphasizing the importance of considering these engineering aspects when working with complex cryptographic operations.
