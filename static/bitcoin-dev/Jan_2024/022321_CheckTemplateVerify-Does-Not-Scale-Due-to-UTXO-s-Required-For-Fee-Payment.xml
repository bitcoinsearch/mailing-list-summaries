    <summary>The utilization of fee-rate-dependent timelocks in Bitcoin transactions presents a challenge regarding the potential manipulation of observed fee-rates by miners. This approach implies an underlying assumption of miner honesty, which markedly deviates from the typical economic incentive-based security model that is generally applied within the Bitcoin ecosystem. The reliance on the integrity of miners to not interfere with fee rates introduces a vulnerability into the system that could be exploited. For further insight and discussions on this topic, interested individuals can engage with resources or reach out through [Peter Todd's personal website](https://petertodd.org) or contact him via email at peter'[:-1]@petertodd.org.</summary>
