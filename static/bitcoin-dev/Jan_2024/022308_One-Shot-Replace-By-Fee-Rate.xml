    <summary>The developer Peter Todd has announced the implementation of a new feature in his Libre Relay fork of Bitcoin, which can be found at his [GitHub repository](https://github.com/petertodd/bitcoin/tree/libre-relay-v26.0). The update introduces a replace-by-fee mechanism with a minimum requirement of doubling the fee rate for transaction replacement. This feature is designed to work specifically with nodes running the same version by using a service bit for node peering, ensuring efficient transaction propagation.

While not yet considered a public release, the code is available for review and experimentation. There are several nodes currently running this version on both the mainnet and the testnet. Feedback is actively sought, especially regarding potential exploits within the replace-by-fee-rate code and interest is shown in observing if anyone will execute the known but costly replace-by-fee-rate denial-of-service attacks.

An intriguing aspect of this release is the removal of restrictions on OP_Return, a change that may provoke reactions from the community due to its controversial nature. Todd mentions he already has the capability to get oversized OP_Return transactions mined, indicating that others who run a Libre Relay node should be able to do the same.
