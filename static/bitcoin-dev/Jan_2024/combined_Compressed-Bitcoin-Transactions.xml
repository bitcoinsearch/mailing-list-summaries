    <summary>The Bitcoin Core reference implementation has been updated with a new Compressed Transaction Schema aimed at significantly reducing transaction sizes on the blockchain. This innovation is especially beneficial for applications with limited bandwidth, such as steganography, satellite communications, and radio broadcasts. The schema achieves compression by eliminating regenerable data, using block height and index as more space-efficient data representations.

Modifications introduced by the Compressed Transaction Schema are expected to change transaction processing methods. Notably, it departs from nLocktime grinding and adopts relative block heights for compressed inputs to simplify the transaction format. The schema uses techniques like public key recovery methods to optimize transaction size for legacy and Segwit transactions, while Taproot keyspend transactions benefit due to their simplified signature requirements.

Developers Tom Briar and Andrew Poelstra's contributions to the schema focus on replacing traditional output information with block height and index to conserve space without compromising security. Their approach is less suitable for recent transactions but works well for historical ones that require blockchain access during decompression. A Draft PR on the Bitcoin GitHub repository provides more technical details.

Tom's correspondence reflects ongoing discussions about implementation details of transaction compression, such as reevaluating lock time handling and introducing a single agreed-upon block height to save bytes. Encoding transaction outputs with a delta from a reference height can further optimize bit savings for multiple transactions or inputs in one packet. Efforts to refine the compression process include using prefix trees and reducing bit requirements for encoding block height and index. The team aims to update code according to documentation and integrate feedback from peers, while also addressing concerns about reorganizations and their potential risks.

Overall, the new Compressed Transaction Schema offers an innovative method for optimizing Bitcoin transactions, aiming for significant size reductions without sacrificing data integrity. It benefits users requiring efficient data transmission in low-bandwidth environments and receives ongoing contributions from developers and researchers for its refinement and implementation.

Tom Briar has developed a compression schema for efficient bitcoin transaction transmission through low-bandwidth media, focusing on common transactions by single parties and safeguarding against data corruption. He has created a pull request to integrate this new schema into existing systems. The inclusion of numerical data for various transaction types, including less common ones like p2sh-wpkh and p2pkh, will enable a broader application of the technique. While excluding traditional sign-offs, the communication emphasizes the technical elements of Tom's work and the continuous progress in bitcoin transaction protocols. Andrew Poelstra metaphorically acknowledges the constant advancements in technology with his optimistic closing remark.</summary>
