    <summary>The integration of feerate-dependent timelocks (FDTs) would allow for transactions to be defined with a set fee while eliminating the need for anchor outputs. This is feasible when these transactions are in competition with another that incorporates an FDT. Such implementation details can be further explored through resources like the Lightning Development Mailing List, where discussions and proposals related to these concepts are shared within the developer community. For more information on FDTs and their implications for transaction protocols, one can refer to the comprehensive discussion found at the [Lightning Development Mailing List](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2023-December/004254.html).</summary>
