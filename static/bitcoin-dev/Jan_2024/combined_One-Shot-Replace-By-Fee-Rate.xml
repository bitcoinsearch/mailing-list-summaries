    <summary>The recent discussions within the Bitcoin development community have brought to light a potential issue with the current Replace-by-Fee (RBF) rules as highlighted by a blog post. The main concern lies in the existing RBF policy's limitation, which allows a high fee-rate transaction to be replaced with one of a lower fee-rate that may not be as attractive for miners to include in a block. This problem arises from an interpretation of BIP-125 Rule 2, which does not prevent combining unconfirmed inputs from different replaced transactions to create a less valuable transaction for the miners. A proposed solution can be found in a draft fix at [this GitHub pull request](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26451), which aims to rectify the situation by ensuring all unconfirmed inputs in a replacement come from the same original transaction.

In response to this, an alternative approach called One-Shot Replace-By-Fee-Rate (RBFr) was proposed and explained through a blog post referenced for discussion. The method outlined in the proposal suggested replacing transactions based on an increase in the fee-rate rather than the absolute fee, potentially addressing issues such as transaction pinning. However, a counterexample presented [on Stacker News](https://stacker.news/items/393182) illustrated a scenario where five transactions could cyclically replace each other, manipulating both RBF and RBFr rules. This example demonstrated how the system could be exploited to use less network bandwidth while maintaining high feerates, ultimately questioning the safety of deploying the One Shot RBFr proposal on the network.

The new One-Shot Replace-By-Fee-Rate model is designed to prioritize transactions based on their fee-rate over their total fee. This new policy focuses on the fee-rate and is likely to ensure quicker inclusion in a block. It benefits miners by encouraging users to raise transaction fees to compete for block space. One-Shot RBFr establishes three conditions for transaction replacement: a higher fee-rate than the original, a fee-rate high enough to place the transaction near the top of the mempool, and ensuring the highest mineable fee-rate of replaced transactions does not suffice for similar mempool positioning. Research backed by Fulgur Ventures indicates that one-shot and purely fee-rate-based policies are resilient against bandwidth exhaustion attacks, suggesting their potential implementation could improve Bitcoin's network efficiency and security, especially in regard to second-layer contracting protocols.</summary>
