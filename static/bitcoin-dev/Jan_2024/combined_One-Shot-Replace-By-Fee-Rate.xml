    <summary>A recent update from a developer has introduced a new fix in the Libre Relay fork of Bitcoin, which can be reviewed on their GitHub repository at [https://github.com/petertodd/bitcoin/tree/libre-relay-v26.0](https://github.com/petertodd/bitcoin/tree/libre-relay-v26.0). This implementation enforces a minimum 2x fee-rate increase for transaction replacement, and utilizes a service bit to ensure compatibility with nodes running the same protocol. The developer is actively seeking feedback on potential exploits in this code, particularly concerning replace-by-fee-rate denial-of-service attacks. There is also an intriguing development regarding OP_Return restrictions being lifted in the Libre Relay, potentially provoking reactions within the community. The authorâ€™s contact information points to Peter Todd's personal website at [https://petertodd.org](https://petertodd.org) and his email address.

The discussion about Bitcoin's replace-by-fee rules brings to light an inefficiency in step 7 of a process related to BIP-125 Rule 2. This rule inadequately prevents certain transactions from being combined in a way that makes them unattractive to miners. A proposed solution, detailed in a GitHub pull request ([https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26451](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26451)), aims to rectify the situation by ensuring all unconfirmed inputs in a replacement transaction originate from the same replaced transaction. This change is designed to eliminate a loophole that currently allows economically viable but rare replacements. Additional clarity on this issue is sought through the use of graphics, suggesting a broader educational effort on the topic.

An analysis of the One Shot Replace By Fee Rate (RBFr) proposal from a blog post by Peter Todd ([https://petertodd.org/2024/one-shot-replace-by-fee-rate](https://petertodd.org/2024/one-shot-replace-by-fee-rate)) reveals a strategy involving confirmed inputs and repeated transaction broadcasting to manipulate feerate and fees within the Bitcoin network. The proposal suggests a cycle that could potentially overload the network with large transactions at minimal cost, posing significant risks to its stability. The sender questions the safety of implementing the One Shot RBFr as it may lead to bandwidth exhaustion and unintended consequences for the network.

In response to limitations within the current RBF policy, a new proposal called One-Shot Replace-By-Fee-Rate is discussed. It serves as an alternative to the absolute fee requirement and emphasizes the importance of fee-rate over total fee. Focusing on fee-rate offers a solution to transaction pinning attacks in contracting protocols like Lightning. The proposal outlines conditions for replacing transactions based on fee-rate to prioritize those more likely to be included in the next block, thereby benefiting miners. Research backed by Fulgur Ventures shows that both one-shot and pure replace-by-fee-rate policies are resistant to bandwidth exhaustion attacks, indicating the viability of these mechanisms for the Bitcoin network and enhancing efficiency and security, especially for second-layer contracting protocols.</summary>
