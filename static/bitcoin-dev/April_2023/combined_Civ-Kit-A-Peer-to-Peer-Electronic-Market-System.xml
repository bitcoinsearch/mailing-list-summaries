    <summary>Antoine Riard, Chris Stewart, Nicholas Gregory, and Ray Youssef are working on a peer-to-peer market system that facilitates censorship-resistant and permissionless global trading. The system combines the Nostr architecture with Lightning onion routing infrastructure to ensure confidentiality. Market boards, which act as Nostr relays with a Lightning gateway, operate independently and compete with each other. Trades are secured through Bitcoin Script contracts, relying on moderations and know your peer oracles for adjudication.One important feedback received on the paper publication was the need to emphasize front-running resistance in a peer-to-peer marketplace. The level of front-running resistance depends on the types of trades considered. To mitigate this risk, two security paradigms are proposed. The first involves duplicating the announcement of offers to multiple concurrent boards and monitoring latency for anomalies. This approach can help identify potential front-running instances, allowing makers to disqualify misbehaving boards. However, it relies on at least one honest board for effectiveness. The second paradigm suggests running the bulletin boards as a federation under Honey Badger BFT consensus. In this approach, offers become consensus items that must be announced to all federation members before adoption, ensuring fairness and reducing the risk of front-running.The researchers also propose a scoring system for trades, counterparties, and service operators using a Web-of-Stakes framework. This reputation paradigm is built upon the Bitcoin UTXO set, assigning an economic weight to each market entity. By integrating state-of-the-art Web-of-Trust techniques, such as decentralized identifiers, into this framework, trust among participants can be established. Additionally, they propose an incentive framework for service operators using privacy-preserving credentials backed by Bitcoin payments, inspired by IETF's Privacy Pass. This incentivizes service operators to provide quality services while maintaining user privacy.The whitepaper delves into the architecture of the system, acknowledging the contributions of peer reviewers. The researchers plan to release code and modules gradually, building on top of the Lightning Dev Kit and Nostr libraries. They aim to collaborate with the community to standardize libraries and ensure interoperability between clients. Feedback from the community is highly encouraged as they continue to develop and improve the system. Overall, the CivKit architecture aims to create a flexible framework for a censorship-resistant and permissionless global trading system that addresses front-running risks and ensures fair trading practices.</summary>
