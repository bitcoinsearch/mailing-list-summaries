    <summary>The exploration into non-lightning Bitcoin use cases reveals a significant vulnerability to replacement cycling attacks, which essentially aim to delay transaction confirmations, facilitating double-spending activities. This issue is particularly pronounced in scenarios where transactions involve hash time-locked contracts (HTLCs), highlighting a method through which attackers could exploit channel topologies to disrupt normal transaction flows between parties such as Mallory, Alice, and Mallet. The crux of the vulnerability stems from shared or joined Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) in multi-user transactions and pre-signed transactions that are executed based on timelocks without further user interaction. These elements are integral to several Bitcoin applications and protocols, including coinjoins and lightning networks, emphasizing the critical need for awareness around the security models and potential vulnerabilities of multi-party applications and contracting protocols.

Further analysis brings to light the susceptibility of transaction-relay and mempool mechanisms to manipulation, paving the way for time-value Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. These attacks specifically target the paralysis of application or protocol execution, causing either extended service disruptions or the wastage of the on-chain time value of coins. Notably, the lightning network, despite its measures against DoS attacks, remains vulnerable, especially in situations where HTLC funds are at risk due to deliberate interference with transaction confirmations. The concerns extend beyond mere denial of service to include the real possibility of fund loss, underlining the importance of timely transaction confirmations upheld by absolute or relative timelocks.

The discourse also covers various second-layer solutions and use cases like on-chain Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs), coinjoins, payjoins, wallets designed for time-sensitive transaction paths, peerswap, submarine swaps, and batch payouts. These systems are identified as being at risk of either fund loss or time-value DoS attacks under certain conditions, underscoring the widespread implications of this vulnerability across a broad spectrum of Bitcoin applications and protocols.

In summary, the issue of transaction-relay jamming presents formidable challenges to the security and functionality of Bitcoin-based services, exposing users to financial risks and undermining the reliability of affected platforms. This comprehensive examination not only highlights the intricate nature of such vulnerabilities within a decentralized framework but also underscores the difficulties in devising and implementing effective mitigation strategies across diverse codebases and user environments.</summary>
