    <summary>The sender is keen on improving the `decoderawtransaction` functionality used in Bitcoin development, focusing on the inclusion of transaction fees and the satoshis per virtual byte (sats/vB) metric. This interest comes from personal experience with the challenges of manually calculating transaction fees when using `createrawtransaction`. The current limitations of `decoderawtransaction` stem from its inability to display fee information, primarily because it cannot determine the value of inputs within a transaction. To address this, the sender proposes a modification that would allow `decoderawtransaction` to fetch details for each input's Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO), calculate the total value of inputs, and then deduce the transaction fee by subtracting the total output value.

In addition, the proposal considers whether the inputs are from the userâ€™s own wallet, suggesting an optional command argument that would conditionally display fee information based on this criterion. Ensuring compatibility with nodes that have `txindex` enabled, which allows for accessing the entire chainstate for transaction ID lookups, is also seen as crucial. Despite acknowledging their limited technical expertise, the sender exhibits a strong willingness to learn and contribute, seeking guidance or criticism to refine their idea. They aspire to contribute the enhancement back to the community through a pull request, even though the project is initially intended for personal learning and use within their own node environment.</summary>
