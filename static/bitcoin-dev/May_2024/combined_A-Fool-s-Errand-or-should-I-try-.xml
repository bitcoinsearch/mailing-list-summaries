    <summary>The discussion revolves around the intricacies and limitations encountered when using the `decoderawtransaction` function in Bitcoin development, specifically relating to its disconnection from block data stored on disk. This detachment complicates the process of tracing transaction inputs back to their origins within the `blocks.dat` folder due to the need for manual intervention, such as creating a "prevout" structure akin to that used by the `getblock` command. The complexity of this task is further amplified in cases where the transaction output does not exist within the blockchain, making it impossible to generate the necessary prevout structure. To address these challenges, there is a proposal for introducing a new RPC call named `getfulltransaction`. This proposed functionality aims to simplify the retrieval of comprehensive transaction details, including previous input addresses and amounts, thereby eliminating the need for the current laborious processes.

Furthermore, there is an expressed interest in expanding the capabilities of `decoderawtransaction` to include insights into transaction fees and the satoshis per virtual byte (sats/vB) metric. The motivation behind this arises from personal experiences with the `createrawtransaction` command, where calculating transaction fees manually proved to be cumbersome due to the existing limitations of `decoderawtransaction`, which currently does not provide fee information. This limitation is primarily because the function cannot determine the value of inputs within a transaction. The proposed enhancement would enable `decoderawtransaction` to automatically retrieve UTXO details for each input, facilitating the calculation of total input values and subsequently, the transaction fees by subtracting the total output value. This solution also contemplates incorporating a feature to determine whether inputs originate from the user's wallet, potentially through a command argument that conditionally displays fee information based on this criterion. Ensuring compatibility with nodes that have `txindex` enabled is also deemed essential, as these nodes can access the entire chainstate for transaction ID lookup. Despite acknowledging their limited technical expertise, the sender is highly motivated and seeks guidance, mentorship, or constructive criticism for their project idea, with the aspiration of eventually contributing their enhancements back to the community through a pull request. This initiative is initially intended for personal use and learning within their own node environment, reflecting a strong commitment to improving the efficiency and user-friendliness of managing and analyzing blockchain data.</summary>
