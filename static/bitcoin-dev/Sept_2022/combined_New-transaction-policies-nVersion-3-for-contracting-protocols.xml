    <summary>Bitcoin developer Gloria Zhao has proposed a set of mempool/transaction relay policies aimed at aiding L2/contract protocols. The proposal includes additional rules for V3 transactions and modifications to package RBF rules. The goal is to improve the security model for layer-two (L2) contracts by allowing for replaceability through child-pays-for-parent (CPFP).Under this proposal, commitment transactions should be V3 and have one anchor output. The child transaction must be V3 and have a maximum size of 1000 virtual bytes (vB). These changes make the descendant limits for V3 transactions more restrictive.The proposal also addresses concerns about Rule 3 pinning and the impact on the UTXO set. It suggests that batched fee-bumping of time-sensitive confirmations of commitment transactions is unsafe and recommends fanning-out big UTXOs in multiple outputs to feed remaining in-flight channels. Additionally, the proposal recommends allowing OP_TRUE to become a standard script type to save bytes.There are discussions on other potential improvements to the RBF system, such as making OP_TRUE standard and allowing outputs below dust. However, it is agreed that these changes can be added later as they won't be standard until they are allowed.The proposal clarifies that V2 and V3 transactions can replace each other to prevent censorship of shared inputs. It also addresses concerns about privacy issues and backward compatibility. Links to the original proposal and related discussions are provided, and feedback and review are welcomed.Overall, Gloria's proposal aims to enhance the security and efficiency of L2/contract protocols through changes to mempool/transaction relay policies, including additional rules for V3 transactions and modifications to package RBF rules.Bitcoin developer Gloria Zhao has proposed a new version of transaction format, V3, aimed at improving replace-by-fee (RBF) and child-pays-for-parent (CPFP) protocols. The proposal includes four rules that specify limits on the size and number of "descendant" transactions. One of the key changes is that a V3 transaction cannot change based on what transactions are mined, which simplifies subsequent rules about descendant limits much easier to check. Commitment transactions should also be V3 and have one anchor output.The proposal aims to prevent pinning attacks where a malicious counterparty prevents a transaction from being replaced by adding many descendant transactions that aren't fee-bumping. Unconfirmed V3 transactions cannot have more than one descendant. A V3 transaction that has an unconfirmed V3 ancestor cannot be larger than 1000 virtual bytes.The proposal also suggests modifications to package RBF rules, including requiring all package transactions with mempool conflicts to be V3.The proposal is intended for usage in Layer 2 Bitcoin transactions, such as commitment transactions on the Lightning Network. It addresses concerns about fingerprinting of LN transactions and proposes improvements to restrict the whole v3 package's size. Feedback and review of the proposal are welcome.In a recent IRC discussion, a proposal was made to address concerns about unconfirmed v3 transactions with ephemeral outputs. The proposed design ensures that any child v3 transaction spending the unconfirmed parent spends the ephemeral output(s) and requires a child to CPFP for transactions that pay no fees. Ruben Somsen expressed interest in allowing transactions to be 0 fees and have a 0 sat output that could be used to pay all the fees with CPFP. The proposal presented is intended for fee-bumping presigned transactions specifically using CPFP and anchor outputs and is a minimally-invasive step that works for Lightning today.The bitcoin-dev mailing list has proposed a new set of mempool/transaction relay policies to aid L2/contract protocols. The proposal aims to improve the security model of L2 contracts and enhance the composability of smart contracting. It includes a package RBF logic, which will replace the parent transaction with a child that's high-fee, making the original tx stuck in the mempool. The proposal also suggests using fingerprinting and an anchor output to detect unilateral closures and allow fee-bumping without publishing one's commitment.Moreover, the proposal recommends a few modifications to the existing policy rules, such as increasing the upper bound of the V3 transaction size to accommodate large UTXOs, allowing OP_TRUE as a standard script type, and adding a 0-value output to make anchors easier to design. However, some concerns have been raised about compatibility with miner incentives and potential utxo set bloat issues.The bitcoin-dev mailing list has proposed a new set of mempool/transaction relay policies to aid L2/contract protocols. The proposal includes a set of additional policy rules applying to V3 transactions, modifications to package RBF rules, and intended usage for LN. The expected questions are answered in the proposal, including whether V2 transactions can replace V3 transactions and vice versa, and if V3 transactions are a privacy issue.Overall, the proposal has generated positive feedback, and it is believed that</summary>
