    <summary>The Bitcoin development team has proposed a set of mempool and transaction relay policies, known as BIP-325, to assist Layer 2/contract protocols. The main focus of the proposal is to introduce version 3 transactions (V3) and modify the package RBF rules.Under the proposed policy, V3 transactions can replace their ancestors' conflicts, even if they do not signal BIP125 replaceability. However, an unconfirmed V3 transaction cannot have more than one descendant and is limited to a size of 1000 virtual bytes. All package transactions with mempool conflicts must also be V3.The rationale behind these changes is to provide inherited replaceability signaling when descendants of unconfirmed transactions are created and to prevent pinning attacks by malicious counterparties. The fee-related rules are economically rational for ancestor packages, but not necessarily for other types of packages. Therefore, only child-with-parents packages will be allowed for package validation.In the Lightning Network, commitment transactions should be V3 and have one anchor output. These commitment transactions can be signed with 0 fees or 1 sat/vbyte once package relay is deployed on a significant portion of the network. If the commitment transaction needs to be broadcasted, the desired feerate at broadcast time can be determined, and the anchor output can be spent in a high-feerate transaction. The child transaction that funds fees for multiple commitment transactions can also be V3 and must be at most 1000vB.It is important to note that the descendant limits for V3 transactions are very restrictive. However, these limits help mitigate Rule 3 Pinning and ensure that both parties involved are restricted by the V3 descendant limit.Regarding privacy concerns, it is acknowledged that V3 transactions may not be widely used outside of L2. Unilateral closes are already identifiable as LN transactions due to the HTLC inputs. Cooperative closes and opens may continue to use V2 transactions, which means the proposal should not worsen privacy concerns.In terms of backward compatibility, a V3 transaction can replace a V2 transaction and vice versa. However, if the original V3 transaction has an unconfirmed V3 parent, it would violate the "inherited V3" rule and be rejected.The Bitcoin development team encourages feedback and reviews on the proposed policies. The full set of rules can be found in the provided links [1] [2].Overall, the proposed policies aim to improve the replace-by-fee feature by introducing V3 transactions and modifying package RBF rules. These changes provide better replaceability signaling and prevent pinning attacks while ensuring economic rationality for ancestor packages.Gloria Zhao's proposal presents a set of policies for mempool/transaction relay that aim to aid L2/contract protocols and address pinning attacks. The proposal includes additional rules for V3 transactions and modifications to package RBF rules.Greg Sanders contributes to the discussion by suggesting solutions for unpinning coinjoins and proposing additional improvements to the proposal. He suggests staging all utxos that are going to be mixed separately into a timelocked utxo to allow for unpinning coinjoins with V3 transactions. However, this approach requires an additional transaction per mixing participant and has less composability with other protocols.Additionally, Greg suggests allowing OP_TRUE to become a standard script type, which would save bytes in anchoring transactions. He also proposes allowing a single dust-value output that is immediately spent by the package, making anchor outputs easier to design.In conclusion, Gloria Zhao's proposal presents a set of policies for mempool/transaction relay aimed at aiding L2/contract protocols and addressing pinning attacks. The proposal includes additional rules for V3 transactions and modifications to package RBF rules. Greg Sanders contributes to the discussion by suggesting solutions for unpinning coinjoins and proposing additional improvements to the proposal. The Bitcoin development team encourages feedback and collaboration on the proposed policies.</summary>
