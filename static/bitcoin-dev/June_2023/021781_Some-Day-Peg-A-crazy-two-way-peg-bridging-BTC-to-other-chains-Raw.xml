    <summary>Hi all,Robin has shared an interesting implementation of a two-way peg in Bitcoin Script. The implementation can be found on GitHub at the following link: https://gist.github.com/RobinLinus/1102fce176f3b5466180addac5d26313.A two-way peg is a mechanism that allows for the transfer of assets between different blockchain networks. In this case, Robin has attempted to implement a two-way peg using Bitcoin Script.While this implementation may not be serious, it provides an interesting exploration of the possibilities of Bitcoin Script. By leveraging the scripting capabilities of Bitcoin, it is possible to create more complex and sophisticated smart contract functionalities.If you are interested in learning more about Bitcoin Script and its capabilities, I would encourage you to take a look at Robin's implementation and explore the provided link for more details.Happy exploring!Best regards,[Your Name]</summary>
