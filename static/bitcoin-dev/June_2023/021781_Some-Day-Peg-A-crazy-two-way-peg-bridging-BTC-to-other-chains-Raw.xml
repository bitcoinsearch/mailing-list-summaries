    <summary>Hi all,In a recent post, Robin shared an interesting and light-hearted attempt at implementing a two-way peg in Bitcoin Script. The code can be found on GitHub at the following link: https://gist.github.com/RobinLinus/1102fce176f3b5466180addac5d26313 This implementation explores the concept of a two-way peg, which allows for assets to be transferred between different blockchains. While this is not a serious implementation, it provides an interesting perspective on how such a peg could potentially be implemented using Bitcoin Script.The code on GitHub provides a detailed breakdown of the implementation, including comments and explanations for each step. It is important to note that this implementation is more of a thought experiment rather than a production-ready solution. However, it serves as a great starting point for those interested in exploring the concept of a two-way peg further.For anyone curious about the technical aspects of Bitcoin Script and how it can be used to implement complex functionalities, this code provides a valuable resource. It demonstrates the flexibility and versatility of Bitcoin Script, showcasing its potential beyond simple transactions.Overall, Robin's implementation of a two-way peg in Bitcoin Script offers an intriguing exploration of the concept. While not intended for practical use, it provides valuable insights into the possibilities offered by Bitcoin Script and its potential for enabling cross-chain asset transfers.Please feel free to check out the code on GitHub for a more detailed understanding of the implementation: https://gist.github.com/RobinLinus/1102fce176f3b5466180addac5d26313</summary>
