    <summary>Hi all,Robin has shared an interesting implementation of a two-way peg in Bitcoin Script. The implementation can be found on the following link: [https://gist.github.com/RobinLinus/1102fce176f3b5466180addac5d26313](https://gist.github.com/RobinLinus/1102fce176f3b5466180addac5d26313).A two-way peg is a mechanism that allows for the transfer of assets between different blockchains, while maintaining their respective values. In this case, the implementation focuses on Bitcoin Script.The provided link leads to a Gist, which is a code snippet or script that can be shared and collaborated on using the GitHub platform. By clicking on the link, you will be able to see the code written by Robin to implement the two-way peg in Bitcoin Script.This implementation is not meant to be taken seriously, as mentioned by Robin. However, it offers an interesting perspective on how a two-way peg could potentially be implemented in Bitcoin Script. It can serve as a starting point for further exploration and experimentation in this area.Feel free to check out the link and explore the code to gain a deeper understanding of the implementation.</summary>
