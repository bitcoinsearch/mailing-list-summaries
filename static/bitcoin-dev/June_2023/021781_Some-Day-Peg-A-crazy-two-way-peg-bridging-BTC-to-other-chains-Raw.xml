    <summary>Hi all,Robin has shared an interesting implementation of a two-way peg in Bitcoin Script. The implementation can be found on GitHub at the following link: https://gist.github.com/RobinLinus/1102fce176f3b5466180addac5d26313.This approach to implementing a two-way peg in Bitcoin Script is not meant to be taken seriously, as Robin mentions. However, it provides an interesting perspective on how such a peg could potentially be implemented using Bitcoin Script.Feel free to check out the provided link to delve into the details of this implementation.</summary>
