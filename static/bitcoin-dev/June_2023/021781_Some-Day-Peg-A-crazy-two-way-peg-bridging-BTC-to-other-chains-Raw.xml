    <summary>Hi all,Robin has shared an interesting implementation of a two-way peg in Bitcoin Script. In his GitHub gist, he provides the link to the code for this implementation. The concept of a two-way peg is a mechanism that allows assets on one blockchain to be securely transferred and represented on another blockchain. In this case, Robin's implementation focuses on Bitcoin Script, which is the programming language used in Bitcoin transactions. The code provided in the gist showcases how this two-way peg can be achieved within the Bitcoin Script framework.To access the code and delve deeper into Robin's implementation, you can visit the GitHub page linked below:https://gist.github.com/RobinLinus/1102fce176f3b5466180addac5d26313 Feel free to explore and experiment with this implementation to gain a better understanding of how a two-way peg can be implemented within the Bitcoin Script environment.Happy coding!-Robin</summary>
