    <summary>https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20200120/9e4d8f57/attachment.htmlIn a recent post on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Robin Linus shared an intriguing experiment involving the implementation of a two-way peg in Bitcoin Script. The concept of a two-way peg allows for the transfer of assets between different blockchains. Linus provided a link to a GitHub gist that contains the code for this experiment.The GitHub gist presents a script written in Bitcoin Script, a scripting language used in Bitcoin transactions. The script demonstrates how a two-way peg could potentially be implemented within the Bitcoin network. It is important to note that this experiment is not intended to be a serious proposal but rather a playful exploration of the concept.While the details of the implementation may be technical and complex, the experiment itself showcases the versatility and potential of Bitcoin Script. By utilizing the scripting language, developers can explore innovative ideas such as the two-way peg and test their feasibility within the Bitcoin ecosystem.Linus's post on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list provides an opportunity for the community to engage in discussions and further exploration of the concept. The mailing list serves as a platform for developers and enthusiasts to exchange ideas, propose improvements, and contribute to the development of the Bitcoin protocol.Overall, Linus's experiment with implementing a two-way peg in Bitcoin Script offers a thought-provoking glimpse into the possibilities of expanding the functionality of the Bitcoin network. The GitHub gist serves as a starting point for developers interested in exploring this concept further and encourages collaboration within the Bitcoin-dev community.</summary>
