    <summary>Hi all,Robin shared an interesting experiment on implementing a two-way peg in Bitcoin Script. The code can be found at this GitHub link: [https://gist.github.com/RobinLinus/1102fce176f3b5466180addac5d26313](https://gist.github.com/RobinLinus/1102fce176f3b5466180addac5d26313).In this experiment, Robin explores the concept of a two-way peg, which allows for the transfer of assets between different blockchains. While the implementation is not meant to be taken seriously, it offers a playful approach to understanding how such a mechanism could potentially work.By sharing this code, Robin invites others to explore and experiment with the idea of a two-way peg in Bitcoin Script. It serves as a starting point for further discussions and developments in the field of blockchain interoperability.Feel free to check out the code and share your thoughts or ideas on this topic.Best regards,[Your Name]</summary>
