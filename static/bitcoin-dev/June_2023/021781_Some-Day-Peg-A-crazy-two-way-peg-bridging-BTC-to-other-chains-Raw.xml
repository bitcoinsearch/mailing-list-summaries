    <summary>Hi all,Robin shared an interesting implementation of a two-way peg in Bitcoin Script. He posted the code on GitHub, which can be found at the following link: [https://gist.github.com/RobinLinus/1102fce176f3b5466180addac5d26313](https://gist.github.com/RobinLinus/1102fce176f3b5466180addac5d26313).A two-way peg is a mechanism that allows for the transfer of assets between different blockchains. It ensures that assets can be securely moved from one blockchain to another and vice versa.In this particular implementation, Robin explores how a two-way peg could be implemented using Bitcoin Script. Bitcoin Script is a simple programming language used for writing smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain.By sharing this implementation, Robin invites others to explore and experiment with the concept of a two-way peg in Bitcoin Script. This could potentially open up new possibilities for interoperability between different blockchains.If you're interested in learning more about this implementation or want to contribute to the project, you can visit the provided GitHub link and explore the code.Keep in mind that this implementation is not meant to be taken too seriously. It's more of a playful exploration of what could be done with Bitcoin Script and a two-way peg.Happy exploring!-Robin</summary>
