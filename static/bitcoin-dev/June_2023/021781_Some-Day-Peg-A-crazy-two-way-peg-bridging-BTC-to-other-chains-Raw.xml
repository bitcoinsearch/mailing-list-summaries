    <summary>Hi all,Robin shared an interesting and not-so-serious attempt to implement a two-way peg in Bitcoin Script. The implementation can be found on the GitHub link provided: https://gist.github.com/RobinLinus/1102fce176f3b5466180addac5d26313. A two-way peg is a mechanism that allows assets to be transferred between different blockchains. In this case, the focus is on implementing it in Bitcoin Script. The GitHub link provides the code for this implementation. It's important to note that this attempt is not meant to be a serious proposal or a fully functional solution. It is more of an experiment or a proof-of-concept. The code may have limitations and may not work as intended in a real-world scenario. Implementing a two-way peg is a complex task that involves ensuring the security and integrity of the assets being transferred. It requires coordination between multiple blockchains and careful consideration of various factors such as consensus mechanisms, trust assumptions, and potential vulnerabilities. While this attempt may not provide a complete solution, it can serve as a starting point for further exploration and research in the field of two-way pegs and cross-chain asset transfers. It can help developers and researchers understand the challenges and possibilities involved in implementing such mechanisms. Overall, Robin's implementation of a two-way peg in Bitcoin Script is an interesting experiment that can contribute to the ongoing discussions and developments in the blockchain community. -Robin</summary>
