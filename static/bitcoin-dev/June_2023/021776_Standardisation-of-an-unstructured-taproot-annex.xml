    <summary>Antoine Riard and Greg Sanders were discussing the opt-in annex policy, where every input must commit to an annex even if it is empty. Antoine asked for clarification on whether this policy would affect non-deployed protocols or deployed ones like coinjoin/lightning spending P2TR outputs. He suggested that loosening the limit from 126 bytes to 256 could result in worst-case liquidity griefing and advocated for sound and "firewalled" signaling and upgrading mechanisms that allow for new policy rules for new use cases to be deployed more smoothly.Greg responded by asking for a citation and warned against building protocols that are meant to go into production on top of undeveloped upgrade hooks. Antoine agreed with Greg but argued that if those use-cases catch up in terms of economic weight, the coordination cost of deploying a new policy might be prohibitive, or require very long periods, as seen with mempoolfullrbf. Antoine also proposed introducing the maximum size/weight of the witness/transaction as a TLV record itself, which can be further relaxed in the future if needed by using max tx size policy "hints" in an annex field.Joost Jager then suggested a restrictive policy that would still enable annex-vaults, which has great potential for improving bitcoin custody. This policy includes opt-in annex, Tlv format, only allowing tlv record 0, and limiting the maximum size of the value to 256 bytes to protect opt-in users. Joost noted that the limit of 126 bytes isn't sufficient for these types of vaults, and asked for practical objections to making the annex standard under the proposed conditions.</summary>
