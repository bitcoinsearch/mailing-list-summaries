    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev mailing list, Joost Jager proposed some policies regarding annex-vaults, which have potential to improve bitcoin custody. The policies include: opt-in annex where every input must commit to an annex even if it is empty to make sure existing multi-party protocols remain unaffected; Tlv format as defined in https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1381 for future extensibility; only allowing tlv record 0 - unstructured data for future extensibility; and limiting the maximum size of the value to 256 bytes to protect opt-in users. However, Greg Sanders questioned the need for limiting the maximum size and suggested using a TLV record itself to introduce the maximum size/weight of the witness/transaction. Antoine Riard also chimed in, stating that requiring every input to commit to an annex even if it is empty would require modifying current Taproot support on the Lightning-side. He added that this would be a mandatory upgrade for Lightning nodes, as failure to do so would break propagations of their `option_taproot` channel transactions.</summary>
