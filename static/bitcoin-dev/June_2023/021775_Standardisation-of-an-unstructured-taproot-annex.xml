    <summary>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list has centered around proposals related to Taproot support on the Lightning-side. One proposal requires every input to commit to an annex, even if it is empty, and failing to do so would break propagations of channel transactions. The second approach introduces a maximum size/weight of the witness/transaction as a TLV record in order to protect opt-in users. This can be further relaxed in the future by using max tx size policy "hints" in an annex field. The limit of 126 bytes proposed in a previous pull request was deemed insufficient for certain types of vaults involving multiple presigned transactions and additional parameters. Therefore, the proposal suggests limiting the maximum size of the value to 256 bytes to protect opt-in users. Overall, the proposals aim to ensure that existing multi-party protocols remain unaffected while also allowing for future extensibility.</summary>
