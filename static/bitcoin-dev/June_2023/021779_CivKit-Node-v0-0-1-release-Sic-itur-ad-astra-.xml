    <summary>The first release of CivKit Node, a basic Nostr relay with additional features for a functional peer-to-peer market board, has been announced. This release is written in Rust and is CLI-only, implementing basic NIP 01 support. However, it is still in a raw state and contains bugs and todos. The release has not been tested on multiple platforms and currently only works as a local host for several functions. CivKit Node includes a sample Nostr client binary for deployment and testing purposes, as well as a utility binary to manage the node with a gRPC interface. The gRPC interface is intended to lay the groundwork for building one or more GUI applications on top, as it has been a consistent request from the community. There is also an experimental integration with BOLT8 Noise transport, thanks to LDK. The goal is to unify the communication infrastructure between Nostr and Lightning, creating a single market of peer-to-peer service providers. This integration would benefit from network law effects and allow for shared work between the Lightning and Nostr ecosystems in terms of spamming mitigations, crypto engineering, and privacy-preserving monetary credentials. The release of CivKit Node marks the start of onion routing support and the implementation of fundamental NIPs like NIP-09, NIP-16, NIP-33, among others. There are plans for integration with a notary protocol, such as Mainstay. Feedback from the community will be taken into account for future development and feature plumbing. The project aims to avoid hard-to-integrate APIs and ensure that product management is owned by the community. Once the communication infrastructure and credentials framework are working, development will begin on the CivKit functionaries services themselves, such as market bulletin boards, rank proof servers, and moderation oracles. Custom services can also be built on top of CivKit Node. The release of CivKit Node brings back peer-to-peer market features that were present in Bitcoin Core in 2010 but were later removed. All works are released under MIT/Apache licenses, and the project aims to adhere to the open-source development standards set by Bitcoin Core and the Linux kernel communities. Contributions from anyone passionate and willing to build are welcomed. The future announcement of CivKit Node will be made on its own communication channel, potentially a new mailing list or an experimental platform on top of Nostr groups. Cryptography innovations are aiming to be standardized under BIPs.</summary>
