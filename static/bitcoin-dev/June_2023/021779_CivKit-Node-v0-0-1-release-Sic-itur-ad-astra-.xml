    <summary>Proudly announcing the first release of CivKit Node, a basic Nostr relay with additional features to create a functional peer-to-peer market board. The release is written in Rust and is currently CLI-only. It implements basic NIP 01 support but contains bugs and todos. It has not been extensively tested on different platforms and functions primarily as a local host. Included in the release is a sample Nostr client binary for deployment and testing purposes, as well as a utility binary to manage the node with a gRPC interface. This interface will serve as a foundation for building GUI applications, which has been a consistent request from the community.One notable feature of this release is the experimental integration with BOLT8 Noise transport, thanks to LDK. This integration allows users to connect to another CivKit Node as a peer, aiming to unify the communication infrastructure between Nostr and Lightning. The goal is to create a single market of peer-to-peer service providers that can benefit from network law effects, such as spamming mitigations, crypto engineering, and privacy-preserving monetary credentials.With this release, the focus will shift towards developing sound onion routing support, as well as implementing fundamental NIPs like NIP-09, NIP-16, NIP-33, and others. Integration with a notary protocol, such as Mainstay, is also planned. Feedback from the community will guide the development of additional features, as the project aims to avoid staying in an "ivory tower" and instead prioritize real-world use cases and constraints.The ultimate goal is to enhance the Bitcoin and Lightning internal economies by leveraging CivKit Node, potentially increasing their scale by an order of magnitude or two. All works are released under MIT/Apache licenses, and the project aims to adhere to the open-source development standards set by Bitcoin Core and the Linux kernel communities. Contributions from passionate individuals are highly encouraged.It should be noted that peer-to-peer market features were originally present in Bitcoin Core around 2010 but were later removed. The project recognizes the importance of careful layerization and believes that censorship-resistant and large-scale peer-to-peer markets are still missing pieces of the Bitcoin protocol stack.Future announcements regarding CivKit Node will be made on dedicated communication channels, such as a mailing list or an experimental platform built on top of Nostr groups. Any cryptographic innovations developed by the project will aim to be standardized under BIPs.Overall, the release of CivKit Node marks an important step towards building a robust peer-to-peer market infrastructure for Bitcoin and Lightning, and the project looks forward to further growth and development in collaboration with the community.Source: [1] [2] [3] [4]</summary>
