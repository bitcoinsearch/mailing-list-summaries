    <summary>The first release of CivKit Node, a basic Nostr relay with additional features for a functional peer-to-peer market board, has been announced by Bitcoin Devs. The release is written in Rust and is currently CLI-only. It supports basic NIP 01 and includes a sample Nostr client binary and a utility binary to manage the node with a gRPC interface. The goal is to build one or more GUI applications on top of this interface. There is also an experimental integration with BOLT8 Noise transport to unify the communication infrastructure between Nostr and Lightning. The hope is to create a single market of p2p service providers benefiting from network law effect.The next steps include implementing sound onion routing support, integrating fundamental NIPs, and exploring integration with a notary protocol. Feedback from the community will be taken into consideration for future development. The project aims to avoid hard-to-integrate APIs and ensure that "product management" is owned by the community. The ultimate goal is to develop CivKit functionaries services such as market bulletin boards, rank proof servers, and moderation oracles. However, custom services on top of CivKit Node are also encouraged.The announcement notes that peer-to-peer market features were present in Bitcoin Core in 2010 but were later removed. The project aims to fill this gap in the Bitcoin protocol stack. All works are released under MIT/Apache licenses and adhere to open-source development standards. The team welcomes anyone who is passionate and willing to contribute to the project. Future announcements will be made on a separate communication channel, potentially a new mailing list or something experimental on top of Nostr groups. The project aims to have cryptography standardized under BIPs.Overall, the release of CivKit Node marks an important step towards building a functional peer-to-peer market board and expanding the Bitcoin and Lightning internal economies.</summary>
