    <summary>A new release of CivKit Node, a Nostr relay with additional features to create a peer-to-peer market board, has been announced by the Bitcoin Devs. The release is written in Rust and is CLI-only and implements basic NIP 01 support. There is an experimental integration with BOLT8 Noise transport, which allows connection to another CivKit node as a peer. The aim is to unify the communication infrastructure between Nostr and Lightning, creating a single market of p2p service providers, including watchtower, state backup, and boards. The release is raw and full of bugs and todos, but there is a sample Nostr client binary for deployment and testing purposes, along with an utility binary to manage the node with a gRPC interface. The team aims to listen to user feedback and develop the project accordingly, without staying in a "purist developer" ivory tower to avoid hard-to-integrate APIs. Once the communication infrastructure and credentials framework are working, development of CivKit functionaries services themselves will begin, including market bulletin boards, rank proof servers, and moderation oracles. The works are released under MIT/Apache licenses, welcoming anyone strongly willing to build with passion and love. For the future, the announcement will be made on its own communication channel.</summary>
