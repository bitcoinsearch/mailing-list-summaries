    <summary>The first release of CivKit Node, a basic Nostr relay with additional features, has been announced by the Bitcoin Devs. The node is written in Rust and aims to provide a functional peer-to-peer market board. Since the publication of the paper in April, there has been interest from individuals looking to contribute code or integrate CivKit into their Nostr and Lightning peer-to-peer market clients.The current release is CLI-only and implements basic NIP 01 support. It is still in its early stages and contains bugs and todos. It has not been extensively tested on various platforms and mainly functions as a local host. The release includes a sample Nostr client binary for deployment and testing purposes, as well as a utility binary to manage the node with a gRPC interface. This interface lays the groundwork for building GUI applications on top, which has been a consistent request from the community.One notable feature of CivKit Node is the experimental integration with BOLT8 Noise transport, thanks to LDK. This integration aims to unify the communication infrastructure between Nostr and Lightning and create a single market of peer-to-peer service providers, such as watchtowers, state backups, and boards. The goal is to share the work between the Lightning and Nostr ecosystems in terms of spamming mitigations, crypto engineering (e.g., onion routing), and privacy-preserving monetary credentials.With this release, the plan is to focus on implementing sound onion routing support and integrating fundamental NIPs like NIP-09, NIP-16, NIP-33, and others. Additionally, there is a plan to integrate a notary protocol, such as Mainstay. Feedback from the community will play a crucial role in determining the development direction of CivKit Node. The project aims to avoid being an "ivory tower" and welcomes input from users to build a product that caters to real-world, unstable, and constrained mobile clients.Once the communication infrastructure and credentials framework are in place, the development of CivKit functionaries services will be a priority. This includes market bulletin boards, rank proof servers, and moderation oracles. However, the project is also open to supporting custom services on top of CivKit Node and exploring new possibilities with Nostr and Lightning maturation.The announcement also highlights the historical context of peer-to-peer market features in Bitcoin Core, which were present in the early days but later removed. The aim of CivKit Node is to fill this gap by providing censorship-resistant and large-scale peer-to-peer markets on the Bitcoin protocol stack.All works related to CivKit Node are released under the MIT/Apache licenses, and the project adheres to the open-source development standards set by Bitcoin Core and the Linux kernel communities. The team behind CivKit Node welcomes anyone passionate about building and contributing to join their efforts.For future announcements, there are plans to establish a dedicated communication channel, such as a new mailing list or an experimental platform built on top of Nostr groups. Additionally, any cryptographic innovations developed by CivKit Node aim to be standardized under BIPs.In conclusion, the release of CivKit Node marks an important milestone in the development of a functional peer-to-peer market board for Nostr and Lightning clients. The project aims to address the missing blocks in the Bitcoin protocol stack and contribute to the growth of the Bitcoin and Lightning internal economies.</summary>
