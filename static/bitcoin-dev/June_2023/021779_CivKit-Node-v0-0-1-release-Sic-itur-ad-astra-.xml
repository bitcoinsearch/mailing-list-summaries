    <summary>The CivKit Node has been released, which is a basic Nostr relay with additional features to have a functional peer-to-peer market board. This release is CLI-only and has not been tested on many platforms, but there is a sample Nostr client binary included for deployment and testing purposes. The node also includes an experimental integration with BOLT8 Noise transport to unify the communication infrastructure between Nostr and Lightning. The goal is to have a single market of p2p service providers benefiting from network law effect. The developers aim to listen to user feedback to improve the project's product management. The CivKit Node aims to build a communication infrastructure and credentials framework, enabling more serious development of CivKit functionaries services and exploration of new custom services on top of it. Peer-to-peer market features were present in Bitcoin Core circa 2010 but have since been removed. The CivKit Node hopes to fill this gap and grow the Bitcoin and Lightning internal economies. All works are released under MIT/Apache licenses, and the developers welcome anyone willing to build with passion and love.</summary>
