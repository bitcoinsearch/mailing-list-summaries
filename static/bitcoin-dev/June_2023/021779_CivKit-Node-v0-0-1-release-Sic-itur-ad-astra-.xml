    <summary>The first release of CivKit Node, a basic Nostr relay with additional features to have a functional peer-to-peer market board, has been announced by the Bitcoin Devs. The release is written in Rust and is CLI-only, implementing basic NIP 01 support. It has not been extensively tested and still works as a local host for many things. The release includes a sample Nostr client binary for deployment and testing purposes, as well as a utility binary to manage the node with a gRPC interface. This interface will serve as the foundation for building GUI applications on top, which has been a consistent request from the community.There is also an experimental integration with BOLT8 Noise transport, thanks to LDK. The goal is to unify the communication infrastructure between Nostr and Lightning, creating a single market of peer-to-peer service providers. This will enable sharing of work between the Lightning and Nostr ecosystems, including spamming mitigations, careful crypto engineering, and privacy-preserving monetary credentials.Future plans include implementing sound onion routing support, incorporating fundamental NIPs like NIP-09, NIP-16, NIP-33, and integrating with a notary protocol such as Mainstay. The developers are open to feedback from the community and emphasize the importance of building for the real-world of unstable and constrained mobile clients.The release of CivKit Node marks a significant step towards filling the gap of censorship-resistant and large-scale peer-to-peer markets in the Bitcoin protocol stack. The project aims to adhere to the best open-source development standards set by Bitcoin Core and the Linux kernel communities and welcomes passionate contributors.The announcement of future updates will be made through a dedicated communication channel, potentially a new mailing list or an experimental platform built on top of Nostr groups. The developers also plan to standardize their cryptographic innovations under BIPs.Overall, the release of CivKit Node is expected to contribute to the growth of the Bitcoin and Lightning internal economies. The project is released under MIT/Apache licenses, reflecting a commitment to open-source development principles.References:[0] CivKit Node GitHub repository: https://github.com/civkit/civkit-node[1] Bitcoin Dev mailing list announcement: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-April/021556.html[2] Lightning Dev mailing list discussion on privacy-preserving monetary credentials: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2023-May/003964.html[3] Bitcoin Core commit removing peer-to-peer market features: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/5253d1ab</summary>
