    <summary>The first release of CivKit Node, a basic Nostr relay with additional features to have a functional peer-to-peer market board, has been announced by the Bitcoin Devs. It is written in Rust and is still in its early stages. The release is CLI-only and implements basic NIP 01 support. However, it is filled with bugs and todos, has not been extensively tested on multiple platforms, and currently only works as a local host for various functions.Included in the release is a sample Nostr client binary for deployment and testing purposes, as well as a utility binary to manage the node with a gRPC interface. This interface lays the groundwork for building GUI applications on top of it, which has been a consistent request from the community. There is also an experimental integration with BOLT8 Noise transport, provided by LDK, to unify the communication infrastructure between Nostr and Lightning and create a single market of p2p service providers.The aim is to share the work between the Lightning and Nostr ecosystems in terms of spamming mitigations, careful crypto engineering (such as onion routing), and privacy-preserving monetary credentials. With this release, the plan is to focus on sound onion routing support, fundamental NIPs like NIP-09, NIP-16, NIP-33, integration with a notary protocol (e.g., Mainstay), and listening to user feedback to guide future development. The goal is to avoid staying in a "purist developer" ivory tower and ensure the project meets the needs of real-world unstable and constrained mobile clients.Once the communication infrastructure and credentials framework are in place, the development of CivKit functionaries services themselves, such as market bulletin boards, rank proof servers, and moderation oracles, will be pursued. However, if users want to start more custom services on top of CivKit Node, the developers are open to exploring those possibilities. The release of CivKit Node is seen as an opportunity to explore the maturation of Nostr and Lightning.The historical note highlights that peer-to-peer market features were present in Bitcoin Core around 2010 but were later removed. The developers believe that censorship-resistant and large-scale peer-to-peer markets are still missing blocks in the Bitcoin protocol stack. The works released are under MIT/Apache licenses, and the developers are committed to following the best open-source development standards set by Bitcoin Core and the Linux kernel communities.For future announcements, the plan is to use a separate communication channel, such as a new mailing list or something experimental on top of Nostr groups. Additionally, if there are cryptographic innovations, the aim is to have them standardized under BIPs.Overall, the release of CivKit Node aims to contribute to the growth of the Bitcoin and Lightning internal economies by providing a functional peer-to-peer market board and inviting passionate developers to join the project.</summary>
