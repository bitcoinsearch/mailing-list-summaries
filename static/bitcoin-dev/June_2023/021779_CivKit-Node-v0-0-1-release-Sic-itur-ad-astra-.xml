    <summary>The first release of CivKit Node, a basic Nostr relay with additional features for a functional peer-to-peer market board, has been announced. Written in Rust, this release is CLI-only and implements basic NIP 01 support. It has not been thoroughly tested on multiple platforms and still functions as a local host for various tasks. The release includes a sample Nostr client binary for deployment and testing purposes, as well as a utility binary to manage the node with a gRPC interface. The gRPC interface provides a foundation for building GUI applications, which has been a consistent request from the community.CivKit Node also features an experimental integration with BOLT8 Noise transport, thanks to LDK. This integration aims to unify the communication infrastructure between Nostr and Lightning, creating a single market of p2p service providers. By sharing work between the Lightning and Nostr ecosystems, spamming mitigations, careful crypto engineering (such as onion routing), and privacy-preserving monetary credentials can be implemented.With this initial release, the focus will shift towards implementing sound onion routing support and fundamental NIPs like NIP-09, NIP-16, NIP-33, as well as integration with a notary protocol like Mainstay. User feedback will play a crucial role in shaping future development, with the goal of building a product that caters to real-world use cases, including unstable and constrained mobile clients.In addition to developing the CivKit functionaries services themselves, such as market bulletin boards, rank proof servers, and moderation oracles, the team is open to exploring custom services built on top of CivKit Node. The announcement concludes with a historical note about peer-to-peer market features being present in Bitcoin Core back in 2010 but later removed. The CivKit project aims to fill this gap in the Bitcoin protocol stack by enabling censorship-resistant and large-scale peer-to-peer markets.All works related to CivKit Node are released under MIT/Apache licenses, and the project adheres to the open-source development standards set by Bitcoin Core and the Linux kernel communities. The team welcomes passionate individuals who want to contribute to the project.Moving forward, future announcements will be made on a dedicated communication channel, such as a new mailing list or an experimental platform built on top of Nostr groups. Additionally, any cryptographic innovations developed by the team will aim to be standardized under BIPs.Overall, the release of CivKit Node represents a significant step towards growing the Bitcoin and Lightning internal economies by providing a robust peer-to-peer market infrastructure.</summary>
