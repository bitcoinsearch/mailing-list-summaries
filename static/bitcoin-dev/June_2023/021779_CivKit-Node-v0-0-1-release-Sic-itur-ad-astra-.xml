    <summary>The first release of CivKit Node, a basic Nostr relay with additional features for a functional peer-to-peer market board, has been announced. It is written in Rust and is currently CLI-only, implementing basic NIP 01 support. However, it is still considered a raw release with bugs and todos that have not been tested on multiple platforms. The release includes a sample Nostr client binary for deployment and testing purposes, as well as a utility binary to manage the node with a gRPC interface. The gRPC interface is intended to lay the groundwork for building GUI applications on top of CivKit Node, which has been a consistent request from the community.There is also an experimental integration with BOLT8 Noise transport, thanks to LDK, which aims to unify the communication infrastructure between Nostr and Lightning. This integration allows for a single market of peer-to-peer service providers, such as watchtowers, state backups, and boards, benefiting from network law effect. The goal is to share the work between the Lightning and Nostr ecosystems in terms of spamming mitigations, crypto engineering, and privacy-preserving monetary credentials.With this release, the focus will shift towards sound onion routing support, as well as integrating fundamental NIPs like NIP-09, NIP-16, NIP-33, and others. Integration with a notary protocol, such as Mainstay, is also planned. Feedback from the community will play a crucial role in determining the features to be prioritized. The project aims to avoid staying in an "ivory tower" and instead embrace the real-world needs of unstable and constrained mobile clients.Once the communication infrastructure and credentials framework are in place, development of the CivKit functionaries services themselves, such as market bulletin boards and moderation oracles, will begin in earnest. However, the project is open to supporting custom services on top of CivKit Node if there is demand from the community.The announcement also reflects on the historical context of peer-to-peer market features in Bitcoin Core, which were present in 2010 but later removed. The removal was seen as a wise decision to ensure careful layerization and avoid the complexity that Bitcoin Core has evolved into. Nevertheless, censorship-resistant and large-scale peer-to-peer markets are still considered missing blocks in the Bitcoin protocol stack.The development team aims to follow the best open-source development standards set by Bitcoin Core and the Linux kernel communities. They welcome anyone who is passionate and willing to contribute to the project.In the future, announcements will be made through a dedicated communication channel, whether it be a new mailing list or an experimental platform built on top of Nostr groups. The project also aims to have its cryptographic innovations standardized under BIPs.Overall, the release of CivKit Node marks an important step towards growing the Bitcoin and Lightning internal economies and addressing the missing blocks in the Bitcoin protocol stack.</summary>
