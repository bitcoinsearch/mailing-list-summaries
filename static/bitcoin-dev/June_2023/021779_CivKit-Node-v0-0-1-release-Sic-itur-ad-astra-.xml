    <summary>The first release of CivKit Node, a basic Nostr relay with additional features to create a functional peer-to-peer market board, has been announced. Written in Rust, this release is CLI-only and implements basic NIP 01 support. However, it is still in a raw state, containing bugs and todos, and has not been extensively tested on various platforms. The release includes a sample Nostr client binary for deployment and testing purposes, as well as a utility binary to manage the node with a gRPC interface, which can be used to build GUI applications on top. The integration with BOLT8 Noise transport allows for connecting to another CivKit Node as a peer, aiming to unify communication infrastructure between Nostr and Lightning and create a single market of p2p service providers.Future developments include sound onion routing support, implementation of fundamental NIPs like NIP-09, NIP-16, NIP-33, and integration with a notary protocol. The project aims to gather relevant feedback from the community to guide feature development and ensure it meets the needs of real-world mobile clients. The release of CivKit Node marks an important step towards filling the gap of censorship-resistant and large-scale peer-to-peer markets in the Bitcoin protocol stack.All works associated with CivKit Node are released under MIT/Apache licenses, following the open-source development standards set by Bitcoin Core and the Linux kernel communities. The project welcomes passionate individuals who are eager to contribute and build using these standards. The announcement of future updates and developments will be made through dedicated communication channels, such as a new mailing list or experimental platforms built on top of Nostr groups. Additionally, efforts will be made to standardize cryptography under BIPs.Overall, the release of CivKit Node represents an exciting opportunity to grow the Bitcoin and Lightning internal economies exponentially, if supported by the karma of the community.Source links:[0] https://github.com/civkit/civkit-node[1] https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-April/021556.html[2] Of course, there are gazillins of things to implement, please open an issue on the repository directly rather than yelling that something doesn't work.[3] https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2023-May/003964.html[4] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/5253d1ab</summary>
