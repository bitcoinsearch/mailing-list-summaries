    <summary>The first release of CivKit Node, a basic Nostr relay with additional features for a functional peer-to-peer market board, has been announced. It is written in Rust and is a raw release that has not been extensively tested on multiple platforms. The current release is CLI-only and implements basic NIP 01 support. Despite being full of bugs and todos, it serves as a local host for various functions. The release includes a sample Nostr client binary for deployment and testing purposes, as well as a utility binary to manage the node with a gRPC interface.CivKit Node also features an experimental integration with BOLT8 Noise transport, thanks to LDK. This integration aims to unify the communication infrastructure between Nostr and Lightning, creating a single market of p2p service providers. The goal is to share work between the Lightning and Nostr ecosystems in terms of spamming mitigations, crypto engineering, and privacy-preserving monetary credentials.The plan moving forward is to focus on sound onion routing support and integrate fundamental NIPs such as NIP-09, NIP-16, NIP-33, and others. Additionally, there are plans to integrate a notary protocol, like Mainstay. Feedback from the community will be taken into consideration to guide future development. The project aims to avoid hard-to-integrate APIs and ensure that the "product management" is owned by the community.Once the communication infrastructure and credentials framework are in place, the development of CivKit functionaries services, such as market bulletin boards and moderation oracles, will begin. However, custom services on top of CivKit Node are also encouraged. The release of CivKit Node aims to fill the missing block in the Bitcoin protocol stack, namely censorship-resistant and large-scale peer-to-peer markets.All works are released under MIT/Apache licenses, with a commitment to adhere to the open-source development standards set by Bitcoin Core and the Linux kernel communities. The project welcomes anyone who shares a strong passion for building with love.In terms of future announcements, the plan is to use a dedicated communication channel, possibly a new mailing list or an experimental platform on top of Nostr groups. If there are innovations in cryptography, the project aims to have them standardized under BIPs.Overall, the release of CivKit Node is expected to contribute to the growth of the Bitcoin and Lightning internal economies by an order of magnitude or two.</summary>
