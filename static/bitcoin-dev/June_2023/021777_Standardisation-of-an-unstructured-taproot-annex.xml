    <summary>In an email, Joost Jager discusses the advantages of the taproot annex. He explains that the annex's data is not included in the calculation of transaction IDs, making it useful for applications that would ideally use covenants. One critical application he mentions is time-locked vaults, which have received positive reception. While proposals such as OP_VAULT are still in progress, pre-signed transactions using ephemeral keys can provide a short-term solution to improve Bitcoin safeguarding. However, without the annex, there is a circular reference problem that prevents the execution of vault creation and signature backup in one atomic operation. This means that if a vault is created but the ephemeral signatures are lost, the funds will be lost as well.Joost argues that the use case for the annex in this scenario has been labeled as speculative, but he believes that every use case appears speculative at this point because the annex is not yet available. He emphasizes the relevance of the intermediate solution described above, especially for those who consider time-locked vaults important for Bitcoin and acknowledge the challenges of implementing soft forks like OP_VAULT.To support this use case, Joost has created a simple demo application available on GitHub. The demo showcases how a coin can be spent to a special address and later moved to a predefined final destination. The annex is used to store the ephemeral signature for the pre-signed transaction, ensuring that the coin cannot get lost. Although the demo may not be practically useful, more advanced covenants such as time-locked vaults can be implemented similarly.Joost hopes that this demo raises awareness about the on-chain ephemeral signature backup functionality enabled by the annex.</summary>
