    <summary>In an email, Joost Jager explains the primary advantage of annex in taproot as its data not being included in the calculation of txid or a potential parent commit transaction's txid. He mentions that this feature makes the annex a powerful tool for applications that would ideally use covenants. He further discusses the most critical application which involves time-locked vaults and how pre-signed transactions signed using an ephemeral key can improve the safeguarding of Bitcoin in the short term. However, he notes that without the annex, backing up the ephemeral signatures of the pre-signed transactions on the blockchain itself is not as safe as it could be due to the circular reference problem. To support this use case of the taproot annex, Joost has created a simple demo application that shows how a coin can be spent to a special address from which it can only move to a pre-defined final destination at a later stage. The demo makes use of the annex to store the ephemeral signature for the presigned transaction so that the coin cannot get lost. Although this application may not be the most practically useful, more advanced covenants such as time-locked vaults can be implemented similarly. Overall, Joost hopes to raise awareness of the on-chain ephemeral signature backup functionality that the annex uniquely enables.</summary>
