    <summary>In an email, Joost Jager discusses the primary advantage of the taproot annex, explaining that its data is not included in the calculation of transaction IDs or potential parent commit transaction IDs. This feature makes the annex a powerful tool for applications that would ideally use covenants. The most critical application in this category is time-locked vaults. Joost believes that pre-signed transactions signed using an ephemeral key can improve the safeguarding of Bitcoin in the short term. However, without the annex, creating a vault and backing up the ephemeral signatures cannot be executed in one atomic operation due to a circular reference problem. This means that if you create a vault and lose the ephemeral signatures, the funds will be lost. Joost labels this use case for the annex as "speculative," but argues that it is relevant given the importance of time-locked vaults for Bitcoin and the difficulty of implementing soft forks like the one required for OP_VAULT. To support this use case, Joost has created a demo application on GitHub that demonstrates how a coin can be spent to a special address and then moved to a pre-defined final destination at a later stage. The demo uses the annex to store the ephemeral signature for the pre-signed transaction, ensuring that the coin cannot get lost. Although the demo may not be the most practically useful, it shows how more advanced covenants such as time-locked vaults can be implemented. Joost hopes that this raises awareness of the on-chain ephemeral signature backup functionality enabled by the annex.</summary>
