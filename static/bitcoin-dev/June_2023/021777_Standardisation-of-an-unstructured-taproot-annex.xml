    <summary>Joost Jager, a Bitcoin developer, has highlighted the primary advantage of Taproot annex in an email. He explained that the Taproot annex's data isn't included in the calculation of the txid or a potential parent commit transaction's txid, making it a powerful tool for applications that would ideally use covenants. The most critical application in this category involves time-locked vaults and pre-signed transactions signed using an ephemeral key. Joost has created a simple demo application to support this use case of the Taproot annex. It shows how a coin can be spent to a special address from which it can move only to a pre-defined final destination. The application may not be practically useful, but more advanced covenants such as time-locked vaults can be implemented similarly. This raises awareness of the on-chain ephemeral signature backup functionality that the annex uniquely enables.</summary>
