    <summary>In an email sent by Joost Jager on June 10, 2023, he discusses the primary advantage of using the annex in Bitcoin transactions. He explains that the annex's data is not included in the calculation of the transaction ID (txid) or a potential parent commit transaction's txid, making it a powerful tool for applications that would ideally use covenants.Jager specifically mentions the importance of time-locked vaults as a critical application for the annex. He refers to the positive reception of proposals like OP_VAULT and believes that pre-signed transactions signed using an ephemeral key can fill the gap and improve the safeguarding of Bitcoin in the short term.The problem Jager highlights is that without the annex, the creation of a vault and the backup of its ephemeral signatures cannot be executed in one atomic operation. This poses a risk because if you create a vault and lose the ephemeral signatures, the funds will be lost. To address this, Jager suggests backing up the ephemeral signatures of pre-signed transactions on the blockchain itself using the annex, ensuring that the vault can always be "opened."Jager acknowledges that some may consider this use case for the annex as speculative, but he argues that all use cases are speculative at this point since the annex is not yet available. He emphasizes the relevance of the intermediate solution described above, especially for those who believe that time-locked vaults are important for Bitcoin and understand the challenges of implementing soft forks like OP_VAULT.To support this use case of the taproot annex, Jager has created a simple demo application on GitHub. The demo shows how a coin can be spent to a special address and then only moved to a pre-defined final destination at a later stage. It utilizes the annex to store the ephemeral signature for the pre-signed transaction, ensuring that the coin does not get lost. Jager notes that while the demo may not be the most practically useful application, more advanced covenants such as time-locked vaults can be implemented similarly.Overall, Jager's email aims to raise awareness of the on-chain ephemeral signature backup functionality uniquely enabled by the annex and its potential applications in safeguarding Bitcoin transactions.</summary>
