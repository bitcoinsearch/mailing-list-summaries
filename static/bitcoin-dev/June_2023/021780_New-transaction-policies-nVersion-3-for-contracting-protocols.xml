    <summary>The proposal is for a set of mempool/transaction relay policies that aim to aid L2/contract protocols. The proposal addresses the issue of pinning and suggests modifications to the existing Package Mempool Accept package RBF rules. The implementation has been done for Bitcoin Core.The proposal introduces V3 transactions, which are currently non-standard in Bitcoin Core. These transactions have additional rules compared to standard transactions. One key rule is that a V3 transaction can be replaced even if it does not signal BIP125 replaceability. This allows for easier replaceability signaling when descendants of unconfirmed transactions are created.Another rule states that an unconfirmed V3 transaction cannot have more than 1 descendant. This prevents a pinning attack where a malicious counterparty adds many descendant transactions that aren't fee-bumping. However, at least 1 descendant is required to allow CPFP (Child-Pays-for-Parent) of the presigned transaction.Additionally, a V3 transaction with an unconfirmed V3 ancestor cannot be larger than 1000 virtual bytes. This limit ensures that the size of the descendant does not become too large, requiring significant fees for replacement. It also allows for a manageable number of UTXOs to fund fee-bumping without the need for a carefully-managed UTXO pool.The proposal also suggests modifications to the Package RBF rules. One modification is that a package may include new unconfirmed inputs, but the ancestor feerate of the child must be at least as high as the ancestor feerate of the parent. This ensures that the child transaction does not have a lower feerate than the parent transaction.Overall, these proposed policies aim to address pinning issues and improve the efficiency of fee-bumping in L2/contract protocols. They provide more flexibility for replaceability and ensure that transactions meet certain criteria to prevent abuse and optimize fee-bumping.Bitcoin developers have proposed a new package relay policy for Bitcoin transactions. The goal of this proposal is to improve the incentive compatibility of replacement transactions. In the new policy, the minimum fee rate between the package and its child's ancestor is not allowed to be lower than the individual fee rates of all directly conflicting transactions and the ancestor fee rates of all original transactions. This modification aims to ensure that replacement transactions are not less incentivized to be mined.Additionally, a new rule is introduced in which all package transactions with mempool conflicts must be Version 3 (V3). This requirement extends to the sponsoring child transaction as well. As a result, only V3 transactions can pay to replace their ancestors' conflicts, and only V3 transactions' replacements may be paid for by a descendant. This rule is economically rational for ancestor packages, specifically child-with-parents packages, but may not be applicable to other types of packages due to the complexities involved in accounting for all possibilities.The intended usage of this new policy for Lightning Network (LN) commitment transactions is also outlined. Commitment transactions should be V3 and have one anchor output. They can be signed with zero fees (or a minimum of 1 sat/vbyte) once package relay is deployed on a significant portion of the network. If the commitment transaction needs to be broadcasted, the desired fee rate should be determined at broadcast time, and the anchor output should be spent in a high fee-rate transaction. This broadcasted commitment transaction is referred to as "the parent," while the attached fee-bumping transaction is called "the child." Several guidelines are provided for the child transaction, including being V3, having a maximum size of 1000vB (which limits the number of inputs that can fund the fee bump), allowing one child to fund fees for multiple commitment transactions (batched fee-bumping), and replacing the child with a higher-feerate transaction for a second fee bump instead of attaching a grandchild. It is emphasized that unconfirmed V3 transactions should never be spent from due to the restrictive descendant limits for V3 transactions.The proposed policy addresses questions regarding Rule 3 Pinning, counterparty's commitment transaction in the mempool, privacy concerns related to fingerprinting LN transactions based on nVersion, backward compatibility issues between V2 and V3 transactions, and the replaceability of V3 transactions that do not signal BIP125 replaceability.Feedback and review of this package relay policy proposal are requested from the Bitcoin community. The full set of rules can be found in the doc/policy/version3_transactions.md and doc/policy/packages.md documents in the pull request. For more details, please refer to the original email proposal [1] and subsequent discussion [2]. Overall, this proposal aims to enhance the incentive compatibility of replacement transactions and provide guidelines for using V3 transactions in Lightning Network commitment transactions.</summary>
