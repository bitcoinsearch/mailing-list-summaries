    <summary>Bitcoin developer Gloria proposed a new package relay policy for Bitcoin transactions. The proposal suggests a set of mempool/transaction relay policies to aid L2/contract protocols and solve the remaining problems in the previously proposed Package Mempool Accept package RBF.The new set of policies includes additional policy rules applying to V3 transactions and modifications to package RBF rules. Existing standardness rules apply to V3, and they can be replaced even if they do not signal BIP125 replaceability. Any descendant of an unconfirmed V3 transaction must also be V3, and an unconfirmed V3 transaction cannot have more than one descendant. A V3 transaction that has an unconfirmed V3 ancestor cannot be larger than 1000 virtual bytes.The proposal also discusses two types of pinning - rule#3 pinning and package limit pinning. Commitment transactions should be V3 and have one anchor output. One child may fund fees for multiple commitment tx ("batched fee-bumping"). The fee-related rules are economically rational for ancestor packages but not necessarily other types of packages. The descendant limits for V3 transactions are very restrictive. The V3 descendant limit restricts both you and your counterparty. It is not necessary to fee-bump a counterparty's commitment tx using CPFP. A new rule requiring all package transactions with mempool conflicts to be V3 was also added. A V3 transaction that does not signal BIP125 replaceability is replaceable. It is possible for a V2 transaction to replace a V3 transaction and vice versa. Finally, two suggestions are made to save bytes by having the input be empty of witness data and allowing for a single dust-value output which is immediately spent by the package.</summary>
