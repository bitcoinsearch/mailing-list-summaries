    <summary>The discussion revolves around CivKit, a peer-to-peer marketplace that aims to enable censorship-resistant and permissionless global trading. The design combines the Nostr architecture with Lightning onion routing infrastructure to provide confidentiality. Market boards are Nostr relays with a Lightning gateway, operating autonomously and in competition.One of the main concerns raised is front-running, which refers to entering trades with advance knowledge of a block transaction that will influence the price of the underlying security. Participants suggest mitigating front-running risks by duplicating the announcement of offers to multiple boards operated by independent identities and monitoring latency anomalies. Another suggestion is to run the bulletin boards as a federation using consensus mechanisms such as Honey Badger BFT.Execution quality and providing a good user experience are important factors discussed. The possibility of tiered services is mentioned where market bulletin boards specialize in processing large-scale volumes of data, while brokers focus on content aggregation and quoting prices. By comparing metrics like execution quality, market participants can choose the service that provides better prices.Front-running is considered a sign of active participants and liquidity in the market, but the emphasis is on finding what products people are interested in trading and giving them a positive user experience.The paper delves deep into the architecture of the system and expresses gratitude to peer reviewers for their input. The authors plan to release code and modules gradually, leveraging the Lightning Dev Kit and Nostr libraries. They aim to adhere to open-source and decentralized standards set by Bitcoin Core and collaborate with the community to standardize libraries and ensure interoperability between clients.Feedback on their work is encouraged, and the authors are named as Nick, Ray, and Antoine.
