    <summary>The LNP/BP Standards Association has proposed Prime, a new layer 1 upgrade for the Bitcoin protocol that aims to make most validation work client-side. This upgrade does not require consensus or majority for initial deployment and can be implemented without a softfork or miners upgrade. The proposal renders Lightning Network and other layer 2 systems redundant and promotes the use of RGB smart contracts for proper assets like NFTs. The white paper outlining the proposal is available on GitHub. The association plans to establish a working group dedicated to formal specifications and reference implementation of the new layer, as well as organize educational activities. To fundraise for the infrastructural effort, they will rely on non-profit donations. Interested parties can contact them via email, while for-profit organizations can become members and contribute to shaping future Bitcoin technologies.Concerns have been raised about the Bitcoin Proof of Work (PoW) anchoring proposal, particularly regarding the potential misuse of the miner single-use-seal and the consensus on protocol reset. These concerns have been addressed in a white paper available on GitHub, which provides detailed explanations. However, reaching a consensus on protocol reset remains challenging, akin to agreeing on mempool contents. It remains to be seen how this issue will be resolved in the future.Dr. Maxim Orlovsky announced the release of the RGB smart contract system by the LNP/BP Standards Association. He emphasized the need to upgrade Bitcoin's layer 1 blockchain, which poses scalability and privacy issues. The Prime proposal aims to address these problems by introducing a scalable and anonymous layer 1, moving most validation work client-side. It can be deployed without affecting users who do not wish to upgrade and without requiring consensus or majority. The proposal also makes Lightning Network and other layer 2 systems obsolete. Proper assets, such as NFTs, would be handled through RGB smart contracts. The white paper for the Prime proposal is available at https://github.com/LNP-BP/layer1/. However, criticisms have been raised regarding the design of the timestamping service and issues with data availability. The proposal needs to provide more clarity on the specific type of single-use-seal it proposes and further discuss double-spend prevention in the smart contract protocol. Additionally, improvements are needed in the P2P network section. To address these concerns, the author suggests reading papers on scalable single-use-seal asset transfer and tree chains.In response to comments from Peter, Maxim Orlovsky agrees that the section describing the timestamping service should be expanded. He clarifies the term "timestamping" as referring to knowledge of certain facts prior to a specific moment in time. He also explains that the term "timechain" is used historically based on Satoshi Nakamoto's naming in the Bitcoin whitepaper. Orlovsky disagrees with claims that the system does not scale, noting that the consensus layer only includes fixed-size headers and does not require sharding. Other data are client-side and shared among network users. Addressing the data availability problem, he proposes a scenario where witnesses can attest to a miner failing to release data from a previous PMT, and the miner can subsequently provide the missing data in the following headers. Orlovsky suggests incorporating fees cryptoeconomics to incentivize miners to provide data promptly. He confirms the proposal utilizes a proof-of-publication-based single-use-seal. While he acknowledges that details of the smart contract protocol, client-side validation, and P2P network structure need further discussion, he believes that exact specifics are less relevant at this stage. In conclusion, Orlovsky agrees to extend explanations in the paper to address the mechanisms for resolving the issues mentioned by Peter.</summary>
