    <summary>The LNP/BP Standards Association has proposed a new upgrade for the Bitcoin protocol called Prime, which aims to address scalability and privacy issues by introducing a scalable and anonymous layer 1. This upgrade would move most validation work into the client-side validation system, leaving Bitcoin as money and the rest of the ecosystem intact. The proposal does not require consensus or majority for initial deployment and can be implemented without a softfork and miners upgrade. It also renders Lightning Network and other layer 2 systems redundant, while ensuring proper assets, NFTs, etc. are done with RGB smart contracts. The white paper detailing the Prime proposal is available on GitHub.In order to facilitate the development and implementation of the new layer, the LNP/BP Standards Association plans to establish a working group focused on formal specification and reference implementation. They also intend to organize educational and workshop activities to enhance community understanding of the technology. As the infrastructure effort should not be managed by a for-profit company, the association plans to raise funds through non-profit donations. Interested parties can contact them via email, while for-profit organizations can become members of the association to contribute to the shaping of future Bitcoin technologies.However, concerns have been raised regarding the Bitcoin Proof of Work (PoW) anchoring proposal. Some individuals question what would happen if a miner spends the current miner single-use-seal while creating a commitment but makes the Payment Transaction (PMT) only partially available or entirely unavailable. The issue of how other miners would reach consensus on whether a protocol reset is required, similar to mempool contents, also remains unclear. These concerns and questions are addressed in a white paper available on GitHub, which provides detailed explanations and proposals.Dr. Maxim Orlovsky, responding to inquiries about the PoW anchoring proposal, pointed out that the scenario mentioned could result in a protocol reset. If a party spends the current miner single-use-seal without creating a commitment or commits to a header without sufficient PoW, any party can create a special bitcoin transaction providing publicly-identifiable OP_RETURN information about a new miner single-use-seal. However, only the first OP_RETURN announcement closed with the proper procedure is considered valid under consensus rules. The specific issue of PMT availability and how miners would reach consensus on a protocol reset, given the difficulty of agreeing on something like PMT availability, remain open questions.On June 1, 2023, Dr. Maxim Orlovsky announced the release of the RGB smart contract system by the LNP/BP Standards Association. He highlighted that the introduction of client-side validation holds the potential for upgrading the Bitcoin layer 1 - the blockchain, which currently poses scalability and privacy challenges. The Prime proposal, a scalable and completely anonymous layer 1 upgrade, aims to address these issues by moving most validation work into the client-side validation system. The proposal does not require a softfork or miners upgrade and does not affect users who choose not to upgrade. It renders Lightning Network and other layer 2 systems obsolete, enabling assets, NFTs, etc. to be done with RGB smart contracts. The white paper detailing the Prime proposal is available at https://github.com/LNP-BP/layer1/.However, criticisms have been raised regarding the design of the timestamping service and the scalability claims. The section about proofs also raises concerns about the scalability of tracking all new PMTs. Additionally, there are issues with data availability, clarity regarding the specific type of single-use-seal proposed, and the functioning of the smart contract protocol operating with client-side-validated data. The P2P network section requires further development as well. To address these concerns, the author suggests reading two papers in detail: https://petertodd.org/2017/scalable-single-use-seal-asset-transfer and https://petertodd.org/2014/tree-chains-preliminary-summary.In response to comments from Peter, Maxim Orlovsky agrees that the section describing the timestamping service should be expanded and clarifies the usage of the term "timestamping" to indicate knowledge of facts prior to a specific moment in time. He also explains that the term "timechain" is used as a historical reference. Orlovsky disagrees with claims that the system does not scale, emphasizing that the consensus layer only includes fixed-size headers, requiring no sharding. Other data are client-side and shared by network users, allowing each user to track and keep only the relevant data for their part of the state history. Orlovsky acknowledges the data availability problem and suggests potential solutions, including witness scenarios and fees cryptoeconomics. He confirms that the proposal involves a proof-of-publication-based single-use-seal. Orlovsky agrees that further explanation is needed regarding the smart contract protocol, P2P network structure, and how the mentioned problems are addressed.In conclusion, Maxim Orlovsky agrees to provide more detailed explanations in the paper to address the issues raised by Peter and clarify the mechanisms employed to tackle those</summary>
