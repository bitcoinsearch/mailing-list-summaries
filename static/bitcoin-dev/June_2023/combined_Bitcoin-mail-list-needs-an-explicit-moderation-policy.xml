    <summary>In a recent post to the bitcoin-dev mail list, Dr. Maxim Orlovsky expressed concern over the lack of clear moderation policies and potential censorship on the list. He had submitted a post regarding a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol that had received broad community support but was not published on the list. Orlovsky proposed several suggestions, including the creation of a dedicated mail list for non-censored submissions, the implementation of clear moderation policies, and the replacement of the current moderator, Bryan Bishop.Orlovsky provided evidence of Bishop's abuse of power and personal biases in moderating the list. He also noted his contributions to the bitcoin community and the support he received from known community members. The post includes links to Orlovsky's previous work and supporting tweets. Annex A provides a Twitter conversation with Bishop, highlighting the lack of clear policies on the list.Orlovsky proposed that the role of the moderator(s) should be purely executive of the policies without any personal preferences, and the incentive to work as a moderator should be reputation-based. He emphasized the need for clear explicit moderation policies and unbiased enforcement to ensure that the mailing list remains an effective platform for discussion among developers.The email exchange between Orlovsky and Bishop revealed Orlovsky's frustration with the moderation process and how it is affecting the publication of his posts on the mailing list. Bishop responded by questioning the abuse being alleged and suggesting that Orlovsky's complaint may be about moderation queue latency and delay rather than personal bias. He also mentioned asking Orlovsky to stop tagging him on quantum woo, which may have caused some tension between them.Overall, the email exchange emphasized the importance of establishing clear moderation policies and ensuring unbiased enforcement on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. Orlovsky's proposals aimed to address the lack of transparency and potential censorship, with the goal of maintaining an inclusive and productive platform for developers.</summary>
