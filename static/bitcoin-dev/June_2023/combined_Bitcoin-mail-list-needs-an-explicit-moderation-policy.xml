    <summary>In a recent post to the bitcoin-dev mail list, Dr. Maxim Orlovsky expressed concern over the lack of clear moderation policies and potential censorship on the list. Orlovsky had submitted a post regarding a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol that had received broad community support but was not published on the list. This prompted Orlovsky to propose several suggestions, including the creation of a dedicated mail list for non-censored submissions, the implementation of clear moderation policies, and the replacement of the current moderator, Bryan Bishop.Orlovsky provided evidence of Bishop's abuse of power and personal biases in moderating the list. He also noted his contributions to the bitcoin community and the support he received from known community members. The post includes links to Orlovsky's previous work and supporting tweets. Annex A provides a Twitter conversation with Bishop, highlighting the lack of clear policies on the list.Orlovsky proposes that the role of the moderator(s) should be purely executive of the policies without any personal preferences, and the incentive to work as a moderator should be reputation-based. He believes that a clear policy must be established and made public after discussion in the mail list. He suggests that Bryan Bishop should be replaced with a new moderator selected from a list of potential candidates using the criteria "least votes against."Additionally, Orlovsky suggests creating a dedicated mail list called "bitcoin-dev-unmoderated" that will publish all submissions without moderation. He believes that this would allow people interested in auditing the bitcoin-dev main mail list's non-censorship to notice if any non-spam email is censored, which can then be announced publicly. In such cases, the failing moderator(s) should be removed and replaced.The email exchange between Orlovsky and Bishop highlights the need for clear moderation policies and unbiased enforcement to ensure that the mailing list remains an effective platform for discussion among developers. It also raises questions about the transparency and fairness of the current moderation process.Overall, Orlovsky's proposals aim to address the concerns of censorship and lack of clear policies on the bitcoin-dev mail list. By suggesting changes to the moderation process and creating a dedicated unmoderated mail list, Orlovsky seeks to promote transparency and inclusivity in the Bitcoin community.</summary>
