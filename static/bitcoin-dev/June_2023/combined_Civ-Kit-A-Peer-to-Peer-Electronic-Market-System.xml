    <summary>The email thread discusses the concept of front-running in peer-to-peer marketplaces. Front-running involves entering into a trade with advance knowledge of a block transaction that will influence the price of the underlying security to capitalize on the trade. The concern is that bulletin board operators may front-run trades, but there are security paradigms to mitigate this risk.One paradigm involves duplicating the announcement of offers to multiple concurrent boards and monitoring the latency for anomalies. Another paradigm involves running the bulletin boards as a federation under Honey Badger BFT, where incoming board offers become consensus items that must be announced to all federation members before adoption. The Civkit proposes a flexible framework for peer-to-peer marketplaces, where propagation latency monitoring and federation set and rules can be tweaked as "front-running resistance" parameters, adapting to the types of trades and market participants' tolerance.Antoine Riard, Nicholas Gregory, and Ray Youssef have been working on a peer-to-peer market system that enables censorship-resistant and permissionless global trading. The design combines the Nostr architecture of simple relays announcing trade orders to their clients with Lightning onion routing infrastructure. The market boards are Nostr relays with a Lightning gateway, each operating autonomously and in competition. The trades are escrowed under Bitcoin Script contracts, relying on moderations and know your peer oracles for adjudication.One of the most relevant feedback received on the paper publication was the lack of underscoring front-running resistance as a fundamental property wished for a peer-to-peer marketplace. It is expected that the level of front-running resistance aimed by the market participants will be heavily functioned by the types of trades considered. There are two security paradigms proposed to mitigate front-running in peer-to-peer marketplaces.The first one is to duplicate the announcement of the offers to a number of concurrent boards operated by independent identities and monitor the latency. Latency anomalies should be spotted by watchtower-like infrastructure, and in case of repeated anomalies, a maker should disqualify the misbehaving board from future announcements. Another paradigm is to run the bulletin boards as a federation, e.g., under Honey Badger BFT, where incoming board offers become consensus items that must be announced to all the federation members' onion gateway.The scoring of trades, counterparties, and services operators should be enabled by the introduction of a Web-of-Stakes, assembled from previous ideas. From the Bitcoin UTXO set servicing as a trustless source of truth, an economic weight can be assigned to each market entity. This reputation paradigm could be composed with state-of-the-art Web-of-Trust techniques like decentralized identifiers. A consistent incentive framework for service operators is proposed through privacy-preserving credentials backed by Bitcoin payments, following the lineaments of IETF's Privacy Pass.The whitepaper goes deep into the architecture of the system. The researchers will gradually release code and modules, building extensively on top of the Lightning Dev Kit and Nostr libraries. They're looking forward to collaborating with everyone in the community to standardize libraries and guarantee interoperability between clients with long-term thinking. Feedback is welcome.</summary>
