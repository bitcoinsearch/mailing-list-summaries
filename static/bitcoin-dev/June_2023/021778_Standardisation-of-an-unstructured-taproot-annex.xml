    <summary>In an email exchange between Antoine and Joost, they discussed the opt-in annex in relation to multi-party protocols. The opt-in annex requires every input to commit to an annex even if it is empty. However, this does not mean rejecting a transaction where the minimal annex with its 0x50 tag is absent. Instead, either all inputs have an annex or none of them have one. This ensures that no version of the transaction will appear where another signer surprises you with a potentially large annex. For future protocols that rely on the annex, everyone would need to opt-in by committing to an annex, which can be empty just to signal opt-in.</summary>
