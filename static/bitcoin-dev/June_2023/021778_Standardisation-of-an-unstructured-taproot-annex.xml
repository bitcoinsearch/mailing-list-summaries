    <summary>In an email exchange, Joost proposed an opt-in annex requirement for inputs to ensure that existing multi-party protocols remain unaffected. The proposal does not reject transactions where the minimal annex is absent, but rather requires that either all inputs have an annex or none of them do. This ensures that signers in a multi-party transaction will not be surprised by potentially large annexes from other signers. For future protocols that rely on the annex, everyone would need to opt-in by committing to an annex, which can be empty to signal opt-in.</summary>
