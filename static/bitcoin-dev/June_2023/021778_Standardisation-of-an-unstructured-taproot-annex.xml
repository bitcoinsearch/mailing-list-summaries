    <summary>In a recent email exchange, Antoine Riard raised a question about the requirement for every input to commit to an annex, even if it is empty. Joost clarified that this requirement aims to ensure that existing multi-party protocols remain unaffected. Specifically, either all inputs must have an annex or none of them should have one.The purpose of this requirement is to prevent situations where one signer surprises another with a potentially large annex in a multi-party transaction. By making it mandatory for all participants to commit to an annex, even if it is empty, everyone can be assured that no version of the transaction will appear with unexpected annexes.Joost also mentioned that this requirement is important for future protocols that rely on the annex. In such cases, everyone involved would need to opt-in by committing to an annex, which can be empty as a signal of opting in.Overall, this requirement ensures consistency and transparency in multi-party transactions and lays the groundwork for future protocols that rely on the annex.
