    <summary>In an email exchange between Antoine Riard and Joost, the topic of requiring every input to commit to an annex was discussed. Antoine sought clarification on whether a transaction would be rejected if it did not include the minimal annex with its 0x50 tag. Joost clarified that the requirement was not to reject transactions without an annex, but rather to ensure consistency in multi-party transactions. Specifically, either all inputs must have an annex or none of them should have one.The purpose of this requirement is to prevent surprises in multi-party transactions where one signer includes a potentially large annex while others do not. By making it mandatory for all participants to commit to an annex, even if it is empty, the risk of unexpected annexes is mitigated. This opt-in approach allows future protocols that rely on the annex to function smoothly, as everyone would have already signaled their intention to participate by including an annex, regardless of its content.Overall, the discussion highlights the importance of maintaining consistency in multi-party transactions by ensuring that all inputs either have an annex or none of them do. This approach helps to prevent surprises and maintain the integrity of future protocols that rely on the annex.</summary>
