    <summary>In an email conversation, Antoine Riard raised a question regarding the requirement for every input to commit to an annex, even if it is empty. Joost clarified that the intention is to ensure that existing multi-party protocols are unaffected. He explained that either none of the inputs should have an annex or all of them should have one. The purpose of this requirement is to prevent surprises in multi-party transactions where one signer adds a potentially large annex without informing others. By committing to an annex, participants can avoid such scenarios. Even if the annex is empty, it serves as a signal of their opt-in to future protocols that rely on the annex.This clarification was provided in response to Antoine's query about rejecting a transaction if the minimal annex with its 0x50 tag is absent. Joost made it clear that rejection is not the intended outcome; rather, the goal is to establish a consistent approach for the inclusion of annexes in multi-party transactions.</summary>
