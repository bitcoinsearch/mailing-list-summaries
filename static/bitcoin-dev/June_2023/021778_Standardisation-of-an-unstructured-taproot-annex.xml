    <summary>In an email exchange, Antoine Riard sought clarification on a proposed opt-in annex. Joost clarified that the requirement for every input to commit to an annex, even if it is empty, does not mean rejecting a transaction without the minimal annex. Rather, it means that in a multi-party transaction, either all inputs have an annex or none of them do. This approach ensures that no version of the transaction will surprise any signer with a potentially large annex. In future protocols that rely on the annex, everyone would need to opt-in by committing to an annex, which can be empty to signal opt-in.</summary>
