    <summary>In an email conversation between Antoine Riard and Joost, the topic of discussion is the opt-in annex for multi-party protocols. Antoine asks for clarification on the requirement for every input to commit to an annex, even if it is empty. Joost explains that the requirement means either all inputs have an annex or none of them do. This ensures that in a multi-party transaction, if one signer chooses not to commit to an annex, they will not be surprised by another signer adding a potentially large annex. The opt-in annex allows for future protocols to rely on it, with everyone needing to commit to an annex, even if it is empty, to signal their opt-in. The email thread does not mention any specific URLs or links.</summary>
