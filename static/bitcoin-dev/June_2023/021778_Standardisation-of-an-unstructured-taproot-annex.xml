    <summary>In a recent email conversation, Antoine Riard questioned the requirement for every input to commit to an annex, even if it is empty. Joost clarified that the intention is not to reject a transaction if the minimal annex with its 0x50 tag is absent. Instead, the requirement is that either all inputs have an annex or none of them do. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that existing multi-party protocols are not affected. In the case of a multi-party transaction, if one participant does not commit to an annex, they can be confident that no version of the transaction will include a surprise annex from another signer. This prevents potential issues arising from unexpected large annexes.For future protocols that rely on the annex, every participant would need to opt-in by committing to an annex. The annex can be empty, serving as a signal of their opt-in status. This ensures consistency and clarity in transactions involving multiple parties.Overall, the requirement for every input to have an annex, even if empty, aims to maintain the integrity of multi-party protocols while allowing for future enhancements that rely on the annex feature.</summary>
