    <summary>In an email exchange between Antoine Riard and Joost, the topic of requiring every input to commit to an annex is discussed. Joost clarifies that by requiring every input to commit to an annex, he means that either all inputs have an annex or none of them do. This ensures that existing multi-party protocols remain unaffected. Joost further explains that if a participant in a multi-party transaction does not commit to an annex, they can be sure that no version of the transaction will appear where another signer surprises them with a potentially large annex. For future protocols that rely on the annex, everyone would need to opt-in by committing to an annex, even if it is empty, just to signal their opt-in.</summary>
