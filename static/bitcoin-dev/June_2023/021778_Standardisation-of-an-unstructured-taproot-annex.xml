    <summary>In an email exchange between Antoine Riard and Joost, they discussed the concept of an opt-in annex in multi-party protocols. Antoine asked for clarification on whether a transaction would be rejected if it didn't include a minimal annex with a 0x50 tag. Joost responded by explaining that the requirement for an annex applies to all inputs in a transaction. Either all inputs have an annex or none of them do. This ensures that no surprises occur where one signer includes a potentially large annex while others don't. Joost also mentioned that in future protocols relying on the annex, everyone would need to commit to an annex to signal their opt-in, even if the annex is empty. The purpose of this opt-in annex is to maintain the integrity of multi-party protocols without affecting existing ones.</summary>
