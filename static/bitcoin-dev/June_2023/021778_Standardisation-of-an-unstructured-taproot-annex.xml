    <summary>In an email exchange between Antoine and Joost, the topic of discussion is about an opt-in annex for transactions. Antoine seeks clarification on what it means to require every input to commit to an annex even if it is empty. Joost responds by explaining that it means either all the inputs have an annex or none of them do. This ensures that in a multi-party transaction, if one participant does not commit to an annex, they can be certain that no version of the transaction will appear with a surprise annex added by another signer. Joost also mentions that for future protocols that rely on the annex, everyone would need to opt-in by committing to an annex, even if it is empty. This serves as a signal of their participation. The purpose of this opt-in annex is to ensure that existing multi-party protocols remain unaffected. The email conversation provides a clear understanding of the concept of an opt-in annex for transactions and its implications in multi-party transactions. It emphasizes the importance of commitment to the annex for participants and highlights its role in maintaining the integrity of the transaction process.</summary>
