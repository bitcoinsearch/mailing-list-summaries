    <summary>In an email conversation, Antoine Riard sought clarification on the requirement for every input to commit to an annex, even if it is empty. Joost clarified that this requirement aims to ensure that existing multi-party protocols are not affected. Specifically, either all inputs should have an annex or none of them should. This means that in a multi-party transaction, if one participant does not commit to an annex, they can be confident that no version of the transaction will include a potentially large annex unexpectedly. For future protocols relying on the annex, all participants would need to opt-in by committing to an annex, even if it is empty.</summary>
