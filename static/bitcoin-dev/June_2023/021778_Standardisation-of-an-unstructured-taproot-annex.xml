    <summary>In a recent email exchange, Joost discussed the idea of an opt-in annex for transactions. The purpose of this annex is to ensure that existing multi-party protocols are not affected. Joost clarified that when he mentioned every input committing to an annex, he meant that either none of the inputs have an annex or all of them have one.The key point Joost made was that if you are part of a multi-party transaction and you do not commit to an annex, you can be certain that no version of that transaction will appear where another signer surprises you with a potentially large annex. This is important because it protects participants from unexpected changes in the annex.For future protocols that rely on the annex, everyone would need to opt-in by committing to an annex. It is worth noting that the annex can be empty, serving only as a signal of opt-in.Overall, the opt-in annex proposal aims to maintain the integrity of multi-party protocols while allowing for future development and reliance on the annex feature.</summary>
