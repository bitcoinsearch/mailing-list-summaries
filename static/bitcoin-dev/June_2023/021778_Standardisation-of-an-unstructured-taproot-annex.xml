    <summary>In an email exchange between Joost and Antoine, the topic of requiring every input to commit to an annex was discussed. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that existing multi-party protocols remain unaffected. Antoine sought clarification on whether a transaction would be rejected if the minimal annex with its 0x50 tag is absent. Joost clarified that all inputs should either have an annex or none at all. By committing to an annex, users can avoid being surprised by potentially large annexes in future versions of the transaction. Opting in by committing to an annex, even an empty one, will be necessary for future protocols that rely on it.</summary>
