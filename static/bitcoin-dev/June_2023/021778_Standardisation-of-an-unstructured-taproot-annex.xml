    <summary>In an email conversation between Antoine and Joost, the topic of an opt-in annex was discussed. The annex is a protocol that requires every input to commit to an annex even if it is empty. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that existing multi-party protocols remain unaffected. If one were to be part of a multi-party transaction and not commit to an annex, they can be certain that no version of that transaction will appear where another signer surprises them with a potentially large annex. For future protocols that rely on the annex, everyone would need to opt-in by committing to an annex (which can be empty just to signal opt-in).</summary>
