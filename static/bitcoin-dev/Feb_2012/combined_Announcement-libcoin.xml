    <summary>Michael Grønager claims that the libcoin/bitcoind client downloads the entire block chain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client, taking less than 90 minutes on a modern laptop. This speedup may have been because of the removal of the secure allocator and as a result fixed the mlock performance bug in the version forked from rather than the current reference client. However, he notes that in the same time it takes the reference client to fully sync, libcoin only made it to height 138k, which is not very far along and will take 3x-4x longer all said. Grønager assumes that libcoin is actually slower because it is CPU-bound on ECDSA checks, which are skipped in bitcoin in blocks up to the highest hardcoded checkpoint. He also mentions that the RPC server in libcoin is much faster than the Satoshi client. In libcoin, all the query methods access the blockChain as a const object and they can hence safely query it without intervening the work of the Node thread. Gregory Maxwell, who was discussing the issue with Grønager, notes that it ended up taking almost exactly twice as long for libcoin to sync compared to the reference client. Maxwell also claimed that straight refactors that don't change data structures and the like usually do not see such big speedups.</summary>
