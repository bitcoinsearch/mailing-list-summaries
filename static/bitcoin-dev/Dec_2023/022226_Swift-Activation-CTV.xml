    <summary>The communication emphasizes the need to construct a BIP 8 client with the 'LOCKINONTIMEOUT' (LOT) parameter set to true, and to distribute it to allow users the option to run this specific configuration. The sender expresses frustration over the lack of support received despite having already created a branch for this purpose, which can be found at https://github.com/xbtactivation/bitcoin/tree/bip8-ctv. The sender asserts that opening a discussion on the trade-offs between different activation methods and providing options should not be perceived as an attack, highlighting the importance of such discourse within the development community. This request conveys a persistent concern regarding the approach to Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) activation, suggesting a desire for more collaborative problem-solving and user empowerment in the decision-making process. The email was sent using Proton Mail, a service known for secure email communication.</summary>
