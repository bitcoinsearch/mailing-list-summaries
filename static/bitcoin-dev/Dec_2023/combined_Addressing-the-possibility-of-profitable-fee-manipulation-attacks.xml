    <summary>In recent months, there has been a noticeable increase in the size of the Bitcoin mempool and accompanying transaction fees. This trend has been attributed to the introduction of ordinals, but patterns within these transactions suggest that there may be deliberate attempts to keep fees high and prevent the mempool from clearing during periods when it naturally would decrease. Observations reveal bursts of small ordinals/BRC-20 transactions with fees set above the average, suggesting coordination by a single actor. The significant growth in the UTXO set, more than doubling over half a year, has caused the chainstate stored by Bitcoin Core to grow substantially, indicating a strain on network resources.

The potential for miners or groups of miners to engage in fee manipulation is a serious concern. Miners padding blocks with junk transactions to inflate fees could be profitable if the cost of creating those transactions is less than the additional fees collected from genuine user transactions. The feasibility of such an attack depends on several factors: the percentage of hashrate participating, the ratio of fee-stuffing to genuine transactions, and the transaction fees necessary to maintain full blocks. A higher percentage of colluding miners reduces the cost of the attack, as they can recoup more of the spent fees. In contrast, honest miners not part of the collusion suffer the opportunity cost of lost fees.

However, this kind of collusion faces challenges. Colluding miners have incentives to cheat by underreporting their hashrate or secretly mining with undeclared hash power, thus benefiting from reduced costs while still collecting the same amount of fees. If every participant follows this rationale, the proportion of colluding miners would inevitably decline. Such behavior undermines the stability of any collusive agreement.

Fee-burning mechanisms, which could potentially counteract fee inflation by removing the incentive for miners to stuff blocks with high-fee transactions, are not a viable solution due to the possibility of out-of-band fee payments. As an alternative, increased use of Replace-by-Fee (RBF) is advocated over Child Pays for Parent (CPFP), the latter being criticized for inefficiency and inaccurate fee estimation. Payment processors like BitPay are mentioned negatively, implying a role in exacerbating fee issues possibly to promote agendas such as larger block policies.

The concern extends to mining pools that filter out fee-paying transactions, which inadvertently aid attackers by reducing the cost of their activities. External links provided offer evidence supporting these observations, including charts illustrating the dramatic rise in UTXOs and examples of blocks containing suspicious transaction clusters.

In summary, the Bitcoin network is currently experiencing abnormal trends in transaction fees and mempool size, possibly due to intentional actions by certain actors. While these observations are speculative, they raise important questions about the integrity of fee markets and the resilience of Bitcoin's design against potential abuses by miners.</summary>
