    <summary>In the examination of blockchain technology, certain inefficiencies and vulnerabilities have been identified, which include the misallocation of block space and the inadvertent destruction of blockspace value. These issues can lead to a discouragement of simple transactions while concurrently fostering a centralization tendency around entities that originate complex transactions.

A detailed mechanism is requested for clarification on how these inefficiencies manifest within the system, with an emphasis on whether they occur inside or outside of the witness. Specific byte examples were cited, such as 205/205 and 767/767, to illustrate the point at hand. The use of the word "should" in this context prompts a question about the intended outcome or objective being pursued through this line of inquiry.

The discussion reflects a need for a deeper understanding of the blockchain's operational mechanisms, particularly how they impact transaction processing and overall network health. The concerns raised suggest that there might be underlying structural issues that could affect the blockchain's efficiency and decentralization principles.</summary>
