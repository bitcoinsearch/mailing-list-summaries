    <summary>In a recent discussion on optimizing transaction sizes with the use of taproot and ephemeral anchors, it has been clarified that the typical size of a commitment transaction is significantly smaller than previously anticipated. The structure of such a transaction includes a single-sig input leveraging musig, two taproot outputs, and an ephemeral anchor output, resulting in a total size of only 162 virtual bytes (vB), which contrasts sharply with the assumed 1000vB. It is noted that the prevalence of commitment transactions containing HTLCs (Hashed Time-Locked Contracts) that are mined is relatively low. However, even when these contracts are present, the transaction size only increases to 206vB.

The potential benefits of removing certain restrictions were also discussed, particularly in scenarios involving multiple force closes. This could lead to significant improvements in such situations, but it seems there was a misrecollection regarding the removal of this restriction.
