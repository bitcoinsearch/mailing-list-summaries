    <summary>The recent developments in a new cryptographic protocol have led to a significant improvement with the potential to reduce the blockchain footprint by up to 66%. This advancement streamlines the process by eliminating the necessity of mining the conventional public key and the requirement for users to broadcast two separate payloads. The innovative protocol is rooted in a cryptosystem that leverages the presumed difficulty of factorizing polynomials in finite fields. The details of this cryptographic method are accessible via a GitHub repository, which can be found at https://github.com/Yuri-SVB/FFM-cryptography/. The author of this breakthrough is preparing to formally introduce these findings as a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) and invites interested parties to establish direct contact for further discussion or collaboration on this project.</summary>
