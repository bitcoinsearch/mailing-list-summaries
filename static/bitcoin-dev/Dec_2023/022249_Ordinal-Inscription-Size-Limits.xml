    <summary>Bitcoin's existing spam prevention mechanism operates through the use of transaction fees. This system is, for the most part, effective. However, the randomness in its efficacy poses a challenge. To overcome this variability, solutions such as payment pools and tree payments have been proposed. Tree payments, for instance, are detailed at the provided link (https://utxos.org/uses/scaling/) and represent one of the innovative methods aimed at enhancing the scalability of Bitcoin by streamlining transactions. These proposed solutions could potentially standardize the effectiveness of spam prevention and contribute to the overall efficiency of Bitcoin transactions.</summary>
