    <summary>The email presents a white paper on a new Kerckhoffian protocol designed for coercion-resistance in the context of self-custody. This protocol aims to provide robust security measures for individuals managing their digital assets without the need to share custody. The significance of this protocol lies in its non-obscure nature, adherence to Kerckhoff's principle, and its compatibility with existing cryptographic schemes such as multi-signature setups, Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme (S4), and inheritance protocols.

Moreover, the proposed protocol is not only secure but also monetizable, suggesting potential for commercial applications. It is designed with the capacity to function as a distributed service analogous to the Lightning Network (LN), which could enhance its adoption and integration into existing systems.

In addition to the coercion-resistant protocol, the author introduces a nascent public-key cryptosystem that relies on the presumed difficulty of factorizing polynomials within finite fields. The details of this cryptosystem are still under development, and more information can be accessed through the provided links to GitHub repositories and additional resources on Linktree. These innovations indicate an ongoing effort to contribute to the field of cryptography and digital asset security.

The links included in the email contain comprehensive details on both the coercion-resistant protocol and the public-key cryptosystem:
