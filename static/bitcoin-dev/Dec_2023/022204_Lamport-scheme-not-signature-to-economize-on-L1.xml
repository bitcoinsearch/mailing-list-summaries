    <summary>Schnorr signatures are a significant aspect of discussions surrounding Bitcoin's security and efficiency. These cryptographic signatures have a serialized format size of 64 bytes, which is achieved by combining the x-coordinate of R and the value of s, each occupying 32 bytes. When compared to two SHA256 hashes, which together also total 64 bytes, it becomes evident that Schnorr signatures are compact and offer a practical way to represent transactions.

However, concerns have been raised regarding the level of security provided, particularly when considering the safekeeping of bitcoins. A mere 12 bytes of security is recognized as insufficient for ensuring the robust protection of bitcoin spending. This highlights the need for a more secure approach to safeguard cryptocurrencies against potential threats and vulnerabilities.</summary>
