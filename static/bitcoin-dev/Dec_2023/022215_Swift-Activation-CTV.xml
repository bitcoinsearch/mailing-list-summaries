    <title>Swift Activation - CTV</title>

    <summary>The email presents an update in the activation parameters for a Bitcoin-related feature, with the author expressing a preference for simplicity and practicality. The author has made modifications to the activation parameters without introducing any new innovation or magic. The updated parameters for the deployment of the covenant tools (CTV) have been shared, which include specific start times, timeouts, and minimum activation heights.

The sender of this email believes that CheckTemplateVerify (CTV) is a simple covenant proposal that meets expectations and is upgradeable. They express a particular interest in payment pools, which CTV facilitates, along with other features such as enabling vaults and congestion control. The email notes that there are more Proof of Concepts (PoCs) available for CTV than were available for the previous Taproot upgrade, indicating a deeper understanding and possibly broader support.

The sender shows urgency in their message, encouraging those who agree with the proposed changes to build and run this client before January 1, 2024. They suggest that failing to do so will result in extended discussions on alternative options like ordinals, potentially delaying activation until 2028. The email closes by identifying the sender as "floppy disk guy" and noting that the email was sent via Proton Mail, suggesting an emphasis on secure communication.</summary>
