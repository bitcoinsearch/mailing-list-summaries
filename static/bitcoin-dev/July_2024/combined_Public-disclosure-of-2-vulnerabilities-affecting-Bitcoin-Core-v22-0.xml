    <summary>The newly disclosed security vulnerabilities pertain to versions of Bitcoin Core that are earlier than version 22.0. This disclosure is a part of the project's shift towards a new vulnerability disclosure policy, details of which, along with information about the two specific security advisories, can be found on the [Bitcoin Core project's website](https://bitcoincore.org/en/security-advisories). The transition to this new policy is being implemented in stages. Future disclosures regarding vulnerabilities fixed in subsequent versions of Bitcoin Core, such as version 23.0 and version 24.0, are scheduled for public release in August and September, respectively. This systematic approach will continue until there are no longer any unmaintained versions left to report on. Following this phase, the newly established disclosure policy will then be applied to newer versions as they are released.</summary>
