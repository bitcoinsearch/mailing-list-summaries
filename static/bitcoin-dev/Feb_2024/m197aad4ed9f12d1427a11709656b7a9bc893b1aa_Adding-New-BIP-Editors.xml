    <summary>The email emphasizes the current state of the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) process and suggests measures to alleviate identified issues. It starts by acknowledging the friction experienced in the BIP process and references admissions from Luke regarding his inability to actively manage the BIPs repository due to time constraints. To address this situation, the proposition involves adding more editors to the BIPs, granting them the same permissions and responsibilities currently held by Luke. This includes assigning BIP numbers, merging pull requests (PRs) for new BIPs, making amendments to existing BIPs, among other tasks as outlined in [BIP 2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0002.mediawikiuser-content-BIP_Editor_Responsibilities__Workflow).

The proposed solution aims to expedite the handling of BIP PRs backlog and improve the efficiency of incorporating changes into BIPs. For the continuity and consistency of the BIP numbering scheme, it is crucial that all BIP editors concur on the adopted numbering methodology. The email further specifies the criteria for selecting new BIP editors, highlighting the importance of choosing individuals with a proven track record in following and contributing to Bitcoin development, possessing the ability to evaluate proposals objectively, and demonstrating a willingness to undertake the editorship roles.

Kanzure and RubenSomsen are recommended as suitable candidates for the BIP editor positions, based on their history and involvement in Bitcoin development. The inclusion of these individuals as BIP editors is anticipated to significantly benefit the Bitcoin community by enhancing the management and progression of BIPs.</summary>
