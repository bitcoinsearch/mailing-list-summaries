    <summary>The recent discussions within the Bitcoin community have highlighted a pressing issue concerning the BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) process. The acknowledgment by Luke, a key figure in managing the BIPs repository, of his inability to actively work on it due to time constraints has led to the suggestion of appointing additional editors for the BIP repository. These new editors would inherit the same permissions and responsibilities currently held by Luke. This includes the ability to assign BIP numbers, merge pull requests (PRs) that propose new BIPs or amendments to existing ones, among other tasks as outlined in [BIP 2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0002.mediawikiuser-content-BIP_Editor_Responsibilities__Workflow). The aim of expanding the team of editors is to alleviate the backlog of BIP PRs, ensuring they are addressed promptly which in turn, would reduce the friction associated with merging changes to BIPs.

For the Bitcoin development ecosystem to continue thriving, it's critical that these new editors not only understand but also agree with the established numbering scheme to maintain consistency in BIPs numbering. The criteria for selecting new BIP editors is stringent, requiring candidates to have a proven track record in following and contributing to Bitcoin development. Additionally, they must be recognized for their ability to objectively evaluate proposals. Two individuals who stand out as potential candidates for this role are Kanzure and RubenSomsen. Their involvement in the BIPs repository is anticipated to significantly benefit the Bitcoin development community by streamlining the process for introducing and amending improvement proposals.</summary>
