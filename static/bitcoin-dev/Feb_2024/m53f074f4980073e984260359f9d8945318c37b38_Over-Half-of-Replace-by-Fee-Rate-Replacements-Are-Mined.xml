    <summary>In the email from Nagaev Boris, a detailed explanation is provided on the selection of a coefficient value for a prototype aimed at balancing between avoiding overpayment and mitigating the risk of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The discussion revolves around the ideal multiplication factor to be applied to transactions to prevent both excessive costs and security vulnerabilities. Several examples of potential coefficients are given, illustrating how different values can drastically change the number of replacements possible within a system: a 2^10 coefficient allows for 1024 replacements, 1.5^10 results in 58, 1.25^10 leads to approximately 9.3, and 1.1^10 reduces this number to 2.6.

Boris elaborates on the decision to use a 2x multiplier in the prototype version, citing four main reasons. First, it establishes a high cost barrier against DoS attacks, making them financially impractical. Second, this multiplier is low enough to serve its primary function of preventing pinning attacks effectively. Third, the chosen ratio is deemed sufficient to incentivize miner participation by clearly aligning with their economic interests. Lastly, the 2x ratio was selected for its ease of implementation due to technical limitations within Bitcoin Core v26.0, which lacks support for multiplication or division operations. Thus, the 2x adjustment was achieved through simple addition, doubling the fee-rate as a workaround.

Despite the conservative choice of a 2x ratio for the initial release, Boris personally considers a 1.25 ratio as potentially more reasonable, suggesting it strikes a better balance. However, he opted for a more cautious approach initially to reduce the likelihood of DoS attacks adversely affecting the system. For further details, Boris references the work of Peter Todd, providing a link ([https://petertodd.org](https://petertodd.org)) for additional insights into the considerations behind these decisions.</summary>
