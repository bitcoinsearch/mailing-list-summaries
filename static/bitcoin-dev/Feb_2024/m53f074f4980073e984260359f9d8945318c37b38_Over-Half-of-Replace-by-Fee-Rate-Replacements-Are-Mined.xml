    <summary>In the development of a prototype aimed at enhancing the security and functionality within Bitcoin Core version 26.0, a specific coefficient was selected to balance between preventing Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and avoiding overpayment scenarios. The chosen coefficient, set at a 2x ratio, was determined after considering various potential values and their implications on system security and operational efficiency. Values such as 2^10, 1.5^10, 1.25^10, and 1.1^10 were analyzed, resulting in replacement capacities of 1024, 58, 9.3, and 2.6, respectively. The 2x ratio was ultimately selected for several reasons.

Firstly, the 2x ratio significantly raises the cost for anyone attempting to conduct a DoS attack, thereby enhancing the system's resilience against such threats. Secondly, this ratio still effectively prevents pinning attacks, which can compromise the network's integrity. Thirdly, it is deemed incentive compatible for miners, ensuring their continued participation and support for the networkâ€™s stability and security. Lastly, its implementation simplicity, due to the current limitations within Bitcoin Core v26.0 that preclude multiplication or division operations, made the 2x ratio an attractive option. This limitation led to the innovative solution of implementing the desired increase by simply adding a fee-rate to itself.

Despite these considerations, there's an acknowledgment that a 1.25 ratio might be more optimal under different circumstances, offering a more balanced approach between security and cost efficiency. However, a conservative approach was preferred for the initial release to minimize potential vulnerabilities to DoS attacks. This decision underscores a careful and deliberate strategy in introducing changes to critical infrastructure, prioritizing system integrity and user protection.
