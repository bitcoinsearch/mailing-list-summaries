    <title>Adding New BIP Editors</title>

    <summary>The discussion revolves around a suggestion to modify the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process. The current practice involves editors rigorously checking each new BIP for technical soundness and completeness, ensuring that the ideas presented are not only plausible but also technically coherent. This is in line with the BIP2 process, which emphasizes the importance of evaluating proposals for their technical merit, regardless of their perceived likelihood of acceptance.

There is a proposition to streamline this procedure by limiting the role of editors to verifying that a BIP is relevant to the Bitcoin ecosystem and adheres to certain formal requirements, such as being a self-contained document with the necessary sections already mandated. This approach aims to alleviate the burden on editors, freeing them from the exhaustive task of assessing technical soundness. Instead, it suggests that the responsibility for evaluating the technical merits of a BIP should fall to the broader audience engaged with the proposal.

By redefining the role of editors to focus primarily on the relevance and formal structure of BIPs, the proposed change seeks to expedite the review process. It positions the Bitcoin community at large as the ultimate arbiter of a proposal's technical viability, thereby democratizing the evaluation process and potentially fostering a more inclusive and diverse range of ideas within the ecosystem.</summary>
