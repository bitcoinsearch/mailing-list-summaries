    <summary>The proposed Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) introduces a standard for resolving human-readable names to Bitcoin payment instructions using DNS TXT records. This approach allows for encoding BIP 21 URI schemes in DNS, addressing the strong user demand for easily understandable names for payment instructions across various cryptocurrency applications. The utilization of DNS offers a global, hierarchical namespace that, when combined with DNSSEC, provides cryptographic security through a simple PKI system, allowing for stateless and even offline validation from a single trusted root. Moreover, DNS queries typically do not reveal the querier's IP address due to proxying through ISP-provided resolvers or the use of open resolvers, further preserving privacy.

The specification mandates that Bitcoin wallets should prioritize explicit public key methods over DNS-based resolution when available. Payment instructions, associated with specific user and domain names, must be stored in a single TXT record and be DNSSEC-signed. Additionally, the proposal outlines strict requirements for DNSSEC signature validation, including the rejection of SHA-1 or RSA signatures with keys shorter than 1024 bits, although SHA-1 DS records may be accepted. It also recommends regular rotation of on-chain addresses in payment instructions to minimize address reuse and suggests displaying recipient information in a specific format for enhanced clarity.

The rationale behind choosing DNS over blockchain-based or HTTP(s)-based solutions includes the drawbacks of existing schemes, such as lack of succinct proofs, exposure of sender IP addresses, reliance on TLS Certificate Authority infrastructure, and limited open access. Despite the censorship-resistance and security benefits of blockchain alternatives, their lack of material adoption and reliance on trusted intermediaries make DNS a more practical choice. The proposal also advocates for private DNS querying methods, like Tor or VPN technologies, to improve privacy and suggests strategies to mitigate potential user enumeration risks inherent in storing valid users directly in the DNS.

Examples provided illustrate how human-readable names would resolve to Bitcoin payment instructions, including support for lightning BOLT12 offers. Reference implementations are also mentioned, including a DNSSEC proof generation and validation tool, and a lightning-specific name to payment instruction resolver, alongside parsing implementations based on BIP 21.
