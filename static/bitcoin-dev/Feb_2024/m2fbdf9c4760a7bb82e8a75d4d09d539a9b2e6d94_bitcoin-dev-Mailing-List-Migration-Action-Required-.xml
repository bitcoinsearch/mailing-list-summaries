    <summary>The migration of the bitcoindev mailing list to Google Groups has been successfully completed after overcoming several obstacles. This transition means that, starting February 2024, emails sent to the old list will no longer be accepted. To avoid missing out on any communications, it's important for members to subscribe to the new mailing list promptly. A 24-hour waiting period before allowing new emails through has been implemented to give individuals ample time to join. The new group can be found at [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/group/bitcoindev), with an ongoing archive of previous messages available at [Gnusha.org](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev).

For those looking to subscribe manually, there are two methods provided: sending a subscription request via email to bitcoindev+subscribe@googlegroups.com and then confirming the subscription by replying to the automated response (users are reminded to check their spam folders), or signing up through the online interface at the provided Google Groups link. It's encouraged for members to opt-in to receiving all messages to facilitate active participation and ease of replying to existing threads, which helps maintain conversation continuity and benefits all readers.

To manage inbox clutter, setting up a filter for messages sent from bitcoindev@googlegroups.com is recommended. Furthermore, the new mailing list archive is accessible online without needing a Google account and is backed up externally at Gnusha.org, ensuring that reliance on Google is minimized and information meant to be public remains accessible. Members of the community are also encouraged to host additional public archives of the mailing list to support data redundancy, with instructions provided for setting up a public-inbox archive.

In addition to operational details, a comprehensive archive of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, reflecting the migration and establishment of the new public-inbox archive, is available [here](https://diyhpl.us/~bryan/irc/bitcoin/bitcoin-dev/bitcoin-dev-ml-archive.2024-02-09-004.tar.gz) with verification hashes provided for integrity checks. It's reiterated that the nature of mailing lists as a mass communication tool necessitates consideration of the relevance and value of posts to the entire community, maintaining a healthy signal-to-noise ratio. The unchanged rules and contact information for moderators are available at the Google Groups page for reference.

Acknowledgments are extended to Joe Rayhawk for his assistance with software and infrastructure configuration during the migration process, highlighting the collaborative effort involved in ensuring a smooth transition for the bitcoindev mailing list.</summary>
