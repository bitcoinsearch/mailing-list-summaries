    <summary>The recent prototype Libre Relay fork of Bitcoin Core v26.0, developed by Peter Todd, introduces a significant update in the form of Pure Replace-By-Fee-Rate (RBFR) with a 2x ratio. This update allows transactions to be replaced if the fee rate of the new transaction is at least twice as high as that of the old transaction(s), potentially even if the absolute fee is lower. This advancement is particularly beneficial for Lightning and similar smart contract systems, offering a solution to pinning attacks by enabling protocol progress through sufficiently high fee bids to ensure mining within a short period.

Despite the potential advantages RBFR offers, current data indicates that miners have not yet widely adopted this practice. A study conducted over a month involving one of the well-connected Libre Relay nodes revealed that among the RBFR replacements meeting the 2x fee-rate requirement, approximately 64% were successfully mined by various pools. This finding underscores a missed opportunity for miners who, by not implementing RBFR, fail to capitalize on mining more profitable transactions before others seize the fees.

The analysis further suggests that relaying RBFR replacements is an effective use of relay bandwidth, given the majority of such transactions are eventually mined. Consequently, there's a call for more nodes and miners to experiment with RBFR, possibly by utilizing Libre Relay to explore its benefits and limitations firsthand. However, it's essential to note that the dataset analyzed was relatively small, consisting of just 14 RBFR replacements observed over the course of a month. These replacements likely originated from various wallets under conditions where transactions were double-spent due to the original transactions having too low a fee-rate for quick mining. Additionally, while this analysis primarily focused on instances where the absolute fee decreased, it acknowledges the potential for scenarios where the absolute fee might increase but still qualify as RBFR due to insufficient increases to meet the normal BIP125 RBF replacement criteria. Therefore, the count of 14 RBFR replacements could be an underestimate, highlighting the need for further research and data collection in this area.</summary>
