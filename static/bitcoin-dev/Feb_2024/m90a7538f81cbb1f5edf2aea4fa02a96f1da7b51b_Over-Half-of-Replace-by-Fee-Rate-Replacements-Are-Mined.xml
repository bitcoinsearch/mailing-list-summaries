    <summary>The recent development and experimentation with Pure Replace-By-Fee-Rate (RBFR) within the Bitcoin network, particularly through a prototype Libre Relay fork of Bitcoin Core v26.0, sheds light on the potential improvements in transaction prioritization and mining incentives. This new RBFR policy allows transactions to be replaced if the fee rate of the new transaction is at least twice as high as that of the existing one(s), even if the absolute fee decreases. This approach is especially beneficial for Lightning and similar smart contract systems, as it can potentially mitigate pinning attacks by ensuring protocol progression through higher fee bids.

Despite the lack of widespread adoption among miners, data collected over a one-month period from a well-connected Libre Relay node indicates a significant success rate for RBFR replacements. Specifically, at least 64% of the observed RBFR replacements, which met the 2x fee-rate requirement, were mined by various pools. This suggests that miners who have not implemented RBFR are missing out on profitable transactions that other miners are capitalizing on. Moreover, relaying RBFR replacements appears to be an efficient use of relay bandwidth, given the majority of these transactions are successfully mined.

The observed data, albeit limited, originates from a diverse set of wallets involving transactions replaced due to insufficient initial fee rates for prompt mining. The analysis focused solely on instances where the absolute fee decreased with the RBFR replacement, excluding cases where the absolute fee increased but did not meet the criteria for a standard BIP125 RBF replacement due to insufficient increase.

This exploration into RBFR reveals its feasibility and benefits, suggesting that more nodes and miners should consider experimenting with this policy to enhance transaction efficiency and mining profitability within the Bitcoin network. The findings, based on a modest dataset of 14 RBFR replacements, underscore the potential for RBFR to improve the dynamics of transaction processing and mining incentive structures.</summary>
