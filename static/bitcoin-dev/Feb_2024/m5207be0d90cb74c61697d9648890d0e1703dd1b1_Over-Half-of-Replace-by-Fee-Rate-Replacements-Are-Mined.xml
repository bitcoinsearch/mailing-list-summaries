    <summary>The concept of a pure replacement by fee rate is being evaluated, focusing on the specific application of a 2x coefficient. Concerns have been raised regarding the potential for this coefficient to lead to excessive payment. The underlying rationale for implementing a 2x coefficient appears to be its utility in mitigating Denial of Service (DoS) attacks that could occur through minimal incremental increases in the fee rate. However, there's an argument to be made for considering a lower multiplier, such as 1.1x, to prevent such DoS vectors effectively without imposing the significant financial burden associated with doubling the fee from 100 satoshis/byte to 200 satoshis/byte. This adjustment would be more manageable and less financially strenuous, particularly when the forthcoming block's fee rate is anticipated to be around 105 satoshis/byte, thereby making a rise to 110 satoshis/byte more palatable than a surge to 200 satoshis/byte.</summary>
