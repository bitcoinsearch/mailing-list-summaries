    <summary>The project in discussion, named Spaces, aims at establishing a scalable and permissionless Bitcoin Certificate Authority with an approximate size of 250KB. This initiative is in the developmental phase, focusing on constructing a zk light client that utilizes the RISC0 zkVM for its protocol. A significant feature of this protocol is its reliance on client-side validation, which is instrumental in achieving decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) that is both efficient and lightweight enough for end-user verification. 

Spaces distinguishes itself through the introduction of "subspaces," which are off-chain entities endowed with substantial autonomy. Although these subspaces share similarities with zk-rollups because the data remains off-chain, they do not fully align with the validium model since data availability does not pose a major concern in this context. Users are empowered to manage their own inclusion proofs, and the commitments made on-chain possess a certain lifespan, within which transactions can be conducted both on and off-chain.

Given the project's nascent stage, feedback from the community is highly encouraged to refine and enhance its development further. For those interested in delving deeper into the technical aspects of the Spaces project, more information is available on their official website, which can be accessed via [https://spacesprotocol.org](https://spacesprotocol.org).</summary>
