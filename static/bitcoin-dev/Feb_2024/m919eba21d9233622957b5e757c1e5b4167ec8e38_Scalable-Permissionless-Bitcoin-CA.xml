    <summary>The project named Spaces is being developed to create a scalable and permissionless Bitcoin Certificate Authority, with an approximate size of 250KB. The team behind Spaces is utilizing RISC0 zkVM for building a zk light client that supports the protocol, which fundamentally relies on client-side validation. This innovative approach aims to leverage Bitcoin and Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs to achieve a decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) that is both effective and lightweight enough for end-user verification.

Spaces introduces a novel concept termed “subspaces.” These are off-chain elements designed with significant autonomy, contributing to the scalability of the system. Unlike zk-rollups, where data is processed on-chain, Spaces operates with its data off-chain. This differentiates it from the "validium" model as well, since ensuring data availability is not a primary concern within the Spaces framework. Within this structure, users possess their own inclusion proofs, allowing them to securely manage their transactions both on-chain and off-chain during the commitments' active lifetime.

At its core, Spaces aims to redefine decentralized PKI by making it more accessible and efficient for users. The project is still in its initial phases, and the development team is open to feedback from the community. For individuals interested in delving deeper into the technical aspects of Spaces, further information can be found at [https://spacesprotocol.org](https://spacesprotocol.org). This initiative represents a significant step towards achieving a decentralized, scalable, and user-friendly PKI solution leveraging the robustness of Bitcoin and the privacy-preserving capabilities of ZK proofs.</summary>
