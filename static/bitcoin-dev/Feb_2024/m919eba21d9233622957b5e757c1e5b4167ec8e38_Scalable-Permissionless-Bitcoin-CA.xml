    <summary>The project under discussion, named Spaces, aims at revolutionizing the domain of Bitcoin Certificate Authority by creating a scalable and permissionless system approximately 250KB in size. This initiative is in the developmental phase and focuses on employing a zero-knowledge light client leveraging RISC0 zkVM for protocol operations, emphasizing client-side validation. The utilization of Bitcoin and Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology paves the way for a decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) that is not only effective but also lightweight enough for end-user verification processes.

A distinctive feature of the Spaces project is its introduction of "subspaces". These are off-chain entities designed to operate with significant autonomy, contributing to the scalability of the system. The concept of subspaces sets this project apart as it doesn't align precisely with existing frameworks such as zk-rollups due to its off-chain data management, nor does it fit into the validium category because data availability concerns are not predominant here. Users of this system will manage their own inclusion proofs, adding a layer of user control over data.

Moreover, the commitments made on-chain within the Spaces protocol have a predetermined lifetime. During this period, users can perform transactions both on-chain and off-chain, indicating a flexible approach to transaction management within the ecosystem. While the project is still in the nascent stages, there is an open invitation for feedback from the community to refine and enhance the protocol further. For individuals interested in delving deeper into the technical specifics of the Spaces project, detailed information is available on their website: [https://spacesprotocol.org](https://spacesprotocol.org).</summary>
