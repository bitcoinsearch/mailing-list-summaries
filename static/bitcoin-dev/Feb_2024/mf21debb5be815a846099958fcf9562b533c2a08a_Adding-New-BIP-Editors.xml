    <summary>In recent discussions, the topic of enhancing the efficiency and organization of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) has taken center stage. A key issue identified is the delay in assigning numbers to proposed BIPs and subsequently getting those proposals merged. This bottleneck has been a primary concern among contributors, suggesting that the process for managing BIP submissions needs refinement.

The suggestion to introduce non-developer triagers or editors has been brought up as a potential solution to alleviate this backlog. These individuals would focus on going through the pile of PRs that seek to modify BIPs, helping streamline the process. Specifically, their role could include the crucial task of assigning numbers to the proposed BIPs, which is seen as an immediate action that could significantly improve the current situation.

This idea aims at not only addressing the current backlog but also at ensuring a smoother, more efficient system for handling BIPs moving forward. The introduction of dedicated roles for managing the administrative aspects of BIP submission and approval could lead to more organized and timely updates to the protocol, benefiting the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.</summary>
