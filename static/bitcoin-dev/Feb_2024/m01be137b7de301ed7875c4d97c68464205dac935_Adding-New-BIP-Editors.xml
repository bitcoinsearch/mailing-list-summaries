    <summary>The email from LÃ©o Haf to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List addresses the need for additional help in reviewing new Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) and suggests how to proceed with the involvement of both developers and non-developers. Haf acknowledges the response to his earlier tweet, which resulted in many volunteers coming forward, indicating a community-driven interest in supporting BIP reviews. While he concurs that having another developer review BIPs would be beneficial, Haf also sees value in involving non-developers for tasks that do not require development skills, particularly in triaging proposals.

Among the volunteers, Jon Atack and Roasbeef are highlighted as experienced developers suitable for reviewing BIPs, though Haf expresses some reservations about Roasbeef taking on this role. Additionally, there seems to be uncertainty regarding the availability of other potential contributors, Kanzure and Ruben. For the non-developer aspect of triaging, Haf proposes considering Seccour and/or Greg Tonoski to test the idea.

Haf emphasizes that while assigning numbers to BIPs is straightforward, the challenge lies in assessing whether a proposal meets the necessary criteria, an evaluation that requires technical expertise. Therefore, he advocates for the swift appointment of more editors to address the immediate need without delaying for a new coordination system for numbering. This approach aims to ensure that the process of reviewing and improving Bitcoin continues efficiently and involves contributions from both the developer and broader community.</summary>
