    <title>Adding New BIP Editors</title>

    <summary>The discussion revolves around the procedure for triaging and editing Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), emphasizing the accessibility of the process to individuals outside the developer community. It is highlighted that for modifications to existing BIPs, the necessary information, such as the list of authors, can easily be obtained from the header of each BIP document. This enables anyone with a basic understanding of the GitHub platform to contact the authors directly for approval of changes without needing special permissions. Once an author approves the modification, the editors can be informed to finalize the changes.

Moreover, the conversation touches upon the handling of newly proposed BIPs, pointing out that individuals familiar with the BIP documentation can assist in identifying and addressing simple issues, such as missing sections, by referencing specific guidelines or requirements outlined in the BIP process documentation. An example given includes directing attention to a pull request review on GitHub ([GitHub pull request review](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1500pullrequestreview-1796550166)), demonstrating how community members can contribute to the improvement and correction of BIP submissions.

Despite the apparent ease with which community members can engage in the non-developer triage of BIPs, there is recognition of the ongoing challenges faced by the BIP editorial team, including delays in assigning numbers to new proposals and merging approved changes to existing BIPs. The correspondence concludes with an acknowledgment of the need for additional BIP editors to address these backlogs and suggests that the proposed candidates for this role are well-suited to help alleviate the current bottlenecks in the process.</summary>
