    <summary>In a recent discussion, it was emphasized that the security of Bitcoin fundamentally relies on ensuring that all parties adhere to economic incentives designed to maintain the integrity of the system. Specifically, the conversation highlighted the potential risks associated with miners receiving offchain payments for their mining decisions. Such practices could undermine the principle that onchain fees ought to reflect the true cost of transaction confirmations on the blockchain. This is crucial for maintaining the decentralized nature of Bitcoin and preventing any manipulation that could compromise its security.

The discourse further explored the implications of using feerate-dependent timelocks (FDTs) as a method to secure Layer 2 protocols on the Bitcoin network. It was argued that while FDTs present a novel approach to enhancing security, they also introduce the possibility of collusion among miners and Layer 2 operators. This collusion could potentially lead to the manipulation of median feerates, thereby enabling theft through artificially low transaction fees. However, it is important to note that Bitcoin already possesses mechanisms to mitigate similar risks, such as those posed by double-spend attacks, through careful selection of security parameters. For instance, an FDT configured with specific parameters could have a negligible chance of being compromised by miners, provided less than 45% of the hashpower is involved in any malicious attempt.

The discussion underscored that the real concern lies in whether a majority, or at least a significant minority, of the hashing power would collude in ways that could facilitate theft, either through double-spend attacks or manipulation of FDTs. In both scenarios, such collusion would likely result in highly visible attacks that could damage the reputation and value of Bitcoin, thereby acting as a deterrent against such actions. Nonetheless, the exploration of alternatives to FDTs that do not depend on detecting spikes in onchain fees was identified as a desirable goal. Unfortunately, no such alternative has yet been identified, underlining the importance of relying on mechanisms like FDTs that are based on onchain fees to prevent security breaches, including forced expiration spam attacks.

In conclusion, the conversation solidified the argument against enabling mechanisms, such as the use of anchor outputs for fee payments, that incentivize miners to seek offchain payments. Such practices pose a threat to miner decentralization and the scalability of Bitcoin without compromising its security through incentivized attacks. Hence, there is a strong case for ensuring that all transaction fees remain onchain to preserve Bitcoin's value, decentralization, and ability to scale securely.</summary>
