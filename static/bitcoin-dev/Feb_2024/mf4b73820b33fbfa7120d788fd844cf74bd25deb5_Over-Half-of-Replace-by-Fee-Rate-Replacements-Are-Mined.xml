    <summary>The Libre Relay implementation presents a unique approach to transaction fee rates, characterized by its memoryless nature which does not take into account the overall conditions of the mempool. This allows for continuous Replace-By-Fee (RBF) replacements beyond the next block fee rate, albeit at a potentially high financial cost. Historically, the absolute maximum fee rate for the next block has been under 1000 satoshis per virtual byte (sat/vB), with the minimum being 1 sat/vB. Utilizing these figures as conservative estimates is advisable, given that escalating the fee rate significantly incurs substantial monetary expenditure for what amounts to relatively minor bandwidth usage at lower fee rates.

In an analysis focusing on the economic viability of such strategies, it's suggested that launching a direct Denial of Service (DoS) attack on public nodes could be a more cost-effective method of achieving similar outcomes. This perspective underscores the potential impracticality of employing aggressive fee rate strategies, especially when alternative tactics could yield comparable results at a lower cost.

Further insight into the development and adjustments within the Libre Relay's codebase reveals that a specific patch related to this topic was not included in the v26.0 release, and its presence in the forthcoming v26.1 update remains uncertain. Nonetheless, integrating this patch through cherry-picking is straightforward, indicating a level of flexibility in adapting the codebase to incorporate new functionalities or improvements. The discussion also introduces resources for deeper exploration of this subject, including a detailed analysis available at [Peter Todd's website](https://petertodd.org/2024/one-shot-replace-by-fee-ratedenial-of-service-attacks). This link provides readers with access to comprehensive insights into the intricacies of replace-by-fee strategies and their implications for network security and operational efficiency.</summary>
