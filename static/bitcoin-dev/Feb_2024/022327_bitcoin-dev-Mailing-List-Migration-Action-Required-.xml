    <title>bitcoin-dev Mailing List Migration (Action Required)</title>

    <summary>The bitcoindev mailing list has been successfully migrated to Google Groups after overcoming initial roadblocks. Subscriptions to the old list are no longer accepted as of February 2024. To avoid missing out on future communications, stakeholders are encouraged to subscribe to the new mailing list promptly. A brief waiting period will be observed before allowing new emails to flow through, providing an opportunity for members to join.

For those wishing to subscribe, two methods are available: via email by sending a request to bitcoindev+subscribe at googlegroups.com and responding to the subsequent automated message (which may appear in the spam folder), or through the online interface at [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev) with any email address registered as a Google account.

Active participation in discussions is best facilitated by opting to receive all messages, ensuring seamless engagement with the community. To maintain an organized inbox, setting up a filter for messages sent to bitcoindev at googlegroups.com is recommended.

The archive of the mailing list, accessible without a Google account, can be viewed online and is externally backed up at [gnusha.org](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev). The same site houses the old mailing list content. The use of Google services for this list is not critical; it serves as a means to distribute public information. In support of decentralization, others are encouraged to host additional public archives of the mailing list. Instructions for creating such archives are straightforward, involving git cloning, subscribing, and configuring either a public-inbox instance or another preferred mail archive system. Once established, details of these archives should be communicated to the moderators.

A complete archive of the bitcoin-dev mailing list is available for download at [diyhpl.us](https://diyhpl.us/~bryan/irc/bitcoin/bitcoin-dev/bitcoin-dev-ml-archive.2024-02-09-004.tar.gz), along with a README explaining the details. Additionally, the integrity of the archive can be verified using provided SHA-256 and SHA-512 hashes.

It's important to remember that mailing lists function as a mass communication tool with limited moderation capabilities. Participants are urged to consider the relevance of their posts to the wider audience, particularly when initiating new topics, in order to preserve a high signal-to-noise ratio. The mailing list rules remain consistent with previous guidelines, which can be reviewed at the Google Groups about page.

Acknowledgments were extended to Joe Rayhawk for his contribution to software and infrastructure configuration during the migration process. Contact information for the moderators remains available for those seeking assistance or wishing to discuss matters related to the mailing list.</summary>
