    <summary>In September 2011, Gavin Andresen proposed a solution to the problem of timejacking and related exploits launched against low-difficulty alternative chains. His proposal involved keeping network rules as they were but changing the timestamp value of blocks that were multiples of 2016. This was to prevent an attacker from introducing a time lapse in between the windows. The timestamp value would be set equal to the highest timestamp that occurred in the previous 11 blocks instead of the current time. This new rule would be initially rolled out for block creation but not enforced until enough miners have upgraded. Luke-Jr reminded Pieter Wuille that there is already a short interval only allowed for blocks in general. However, during a timejacking attack, multiple-of-2016 blocks' timestamps are essentially independent of others. Therefore, most timestamps are very low, and only those of multiple-of-2016-blocks correspond to the current time. By fixing the timestamp occasionally more tightly to the maximum, instead of the median, no such time lapses are possible. Pieter updated his proposed rule: limit the timestamp of multiple-of-2016-blocks to [max(past 11 timestamps)+1 ... current_time+7200], essentially just using a maximum instead of a median. Alex Waters suggested bundling this and potential future blockchain-splitting changes and implementing them in a major release down the road or saving them for when they are very necessary. Pieter however, is generally opposed to doing too much at once in this kind of change, some changes are completely uncontroversial where some have more complicated social/economic impacts. He suggests taking one per year, with six months of gap between implementation. Aidan Thornton pointed out that if only a small percentage of mining power adopts this scheme, everyone that does so will presumably harm themselves by increasing the odds that the next block they mine will become invalid. Pieter suggested delaying the forwarding of these blocks and blocks that extend them until extended one more time.</summary>
