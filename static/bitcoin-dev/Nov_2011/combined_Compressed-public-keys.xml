    <summary>Pieter Wuille has submitted a pull request (#649) that allows the use of compressed public keys in Bitcoin. These keys are 33 bytes long and contain only X-coordinate information while the value of Y-coordinate is reconstructed upon use. This requires less CPU than verifying a signature. One private key now corresponds to two public keys, creating two different addresses. The implementation chooses only one address (at key generation time) to avoid confusion. All keys generated when -compressedpubkeys is active are compressed, and their reported address is that corresponding to its compressed pubkey. OpenSSL supports compressed public keys, but it is unclear if all client implementations support them. Secrets for compressed pubkeys also require attention. Finally, send-to-pubkey transactions have not been tested yet. A compressed public key testnet address was provided for testing purposes.</summary>
