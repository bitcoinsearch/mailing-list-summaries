    <summary>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process aims to provide a means of measuring consensus for potential changes to the Bitcoin protocol. The CCVS, or Confirmed Commitment Voting System, is a tool that developers can use to measure support for BIPs and provide a public record of confirmed votes. However, node voting has yet to be resolved. The CCVS introduces a financial component to the decision-making process but seeks to mitigate the influence of money by giving confirmed votes to key stakeholders and negating the effect of anyone trying to manipulate the results by voting repeatedly. Nonetheless, the author believes that the CCVS lacks systemization around what is required to pass or fail a proposal and that involving money in raising an objection is not ideal.The author is in favor of having a way for developers to show that they have given an idea legitimate consideration but believes that involving money in raising an objection would shut down important valid opinions. The author prefers to think of Bitcoin as a system of vetoes rather than approvals, where legitimate objections should not require money or political power. The author thinks that legitimate objections should not require money or political power and anyone with a legitimate objection should be able to raise it, even if they are a 13-year-old who has never been seen before.Voting would run for a pre-defined period, ending when a particular block number is mined. Each competing BIP will be assigned a unique bitcoin address which is added to each header, and anyone wanting to vote would cast their ballot by sending a small amount (0.0001 btc) to their preferred BIP's address. Confirmed Vote Multiplier is also introduced to give a larger voice to organizations and people who will have to implement whatever BIP the community prefers. Mining Pools, companies using Bitcoin, and Core maintainers/contributors are allowed one confirmed vote each, which is worth 10,000x a regular vote. Confirmed votes would be added to a new section in each respective BIP as a public record. Overall, the CCVS is a step towards making the Bitcoin protocol more inclusive and democratic while still maintaining the security and integrity of the network. The author agrees with the motivation of making it easier to figure out who had considered a proposal and what their objections or praises were, but believes that the CCVS lacks systemization around what is required to pass or fail a proposal.</summary>
