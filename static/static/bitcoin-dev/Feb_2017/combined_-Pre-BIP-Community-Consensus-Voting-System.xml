    <summary>The Community Converged Validation System (CCVS) is a proposal aimed at measuring consensus for potential changes to the Bitcoin protocol. It provides a means of helping developers measure support for Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) before implementing them. The CCVS assigns unique bitcoin addresses to each competing BIP, allowing for public and relatively difficult-to-manipulate voting. Members of the community can vote on proposed changes, and mining pools, companies using Bitcoin, and Core maintainers/contributors are allowed one confirmed vote each, which is worth 10,000 times a regular vote. Confirmed votes would be added to a new section in each respective BIP as a public record. Voting would run for a pre-defined period and end when a particular block number is mined. The CCVS is seen as an important step towards ensuring that proposed changes have widespread support from the community before being implemented. However, there are differing opinions on the best way to achieve this goal. Some individuals believe that an on-chain system with confirmed vote multipliers is necessary for a fair and accurate representation of the community's preferences, while others believe that simpler, more inclusive approaches should be utilized to ensure that all voices are heard. Additionally, the issue of node voting has not been resolved yet.Some individuals believe that involving money or political power to raise an objection could shut down important valid opinions. They also prefer to think of Bitcoin as a system of vetos rather than a system of approvals. They believe that it would be good if it were easier to figure out who had considered a proposal and what their objections or praises were, without any systemization around what is required to pass or fail a proposal, and with no barrier to entry to provide an opinion. Overall, the CCVS proposes a means of measuring consensus for potential changes to the Bitcoin protocol. While it has some support, there are concerns about its fairness and inclusivity. The issue of node voting also remains unresolved, and there are some who believe that simpler approaches should be used to ensure that all voices are heard.</summary>
