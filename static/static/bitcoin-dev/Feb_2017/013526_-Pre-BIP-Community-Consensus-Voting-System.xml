    <summary>The author of this statement is in favor of having a way for developers to show that they have given an idea legitimate consideration. They believe that some proposals are often considered more in-depth before rejection than the proposer realizes, however, they do not think any sort of on-chain system makes sense as it complicates things by adding code, incentives, and other complexities that are not necessary. The author prefers to think of Bitcoin as a system of vetos rather than a system of approvals, where changes will be small, highly technical, and have no visible impact on everyday users. These types of changes do not need support outside the developers, and the author believes that even if a proposal has support from 85% of the participants, it may still be a bad idea if there is a legitimate technical, social, or political reason against it.Furthermore, the author does not think it should cost money or political power to raise an objection, and anyone with a legitimate objection, regardless of their age or recognition in the community, should be able to raise one. Involving money is likely to shut down important valid opinions.While the author agrees with the motivation behind having a way to track considerations and objections to proposals, they would like to see it without any systemization around what is required to pass or fail a proposal and with no barrier to entry to provide an opinion.</summary>
