    <summary>The author of the given context likes the idea of having a way for developers to show that they have given an idea legitimate consideration. However, the author does not think any on-chain system really makes sense as it complicates things and adds code, incentives, etc. The author prefers to think of Bitcoin as a system of vetoes rather than a system of approvals as sometimes changes are small, highly technical, and have no visible impact to everyday users. Furthermore, the author believes that involving money in raising an objection is almost certainly going to shut down important valid opinions. The author agrees with the motivation of making it easier to figure out who had considered a proposal and what their objections or praises were, but without any systemization around what is required to pass or fail a proposal, and with no barrier to entry to provide an opinion. The author also thinks that legitimate objections should not require money or political power and anyone with a legitimate objection should be able to raise it, even if they are a 13-year-old who has never been seen before.</summary>
