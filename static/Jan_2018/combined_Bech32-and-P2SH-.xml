    <summary>The writer is discussing a proposal called P2SH2, which was suggested as a thought experiment and does not offer much use in the context of Bitcoin today. The output space has become relatively more expensive due to weight calculations and fees being at non-negligible rates, so interest in "storing data" in outputs should not be increasing. Additionally, the writer notes that Bech32 was rushed to market without public review, and adding more address diversity would not be good for the ecosystem. Instead, the writer suggests considering an address-next proposal with an explicit timeframe of N years out, and very loud warnings not to deploy it. Layered hashing is just one minor aspect, and other features such as coded expiration times and abilities to have amounts under checksum are likely more worth consideration. The writer also mentions a previous discussion on the P2SH2 improvements, which involves having the address include a single SHA256 hash of the public key or script instead of RIPEMD160(SHA256(pubkey)) or SHA256(SHA256(script)). This would enable relaying the "middle-hash" as a way to prove the final hash is a hash itself, thereby proving it is not embedded data spam. The writer suggests that Bech32 could have been a good opportunity to add this, as many people will probably be upgrading to it at some point.</summary>
