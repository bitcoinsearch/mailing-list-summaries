    <summary>The writer of the context is informing readers that they resigned from Blockstream in November to focus on working independently on deep protocol work, specifically new cryptographic privacy and security technology for Bitcoin. They explain that when Blockstream was founded, there was significant underinvestment in Bitcoin technology, but the company hoped to act as an anchor of support for technology development and help grow the community. The author notes that this has been a big success, with the Bitcoin industry maturing and Bitcoin Core receiving regular contributions from many organizations and a larger volunteer community. The author states that they are excited about the new technology coming to production and will be spending more time helping with these and other things, no longer having insight into Blockstream's activities or a Blockstream email address.</summary>
