    <summary>When discussing newer and more efficient pubkey types such as signature aggregation or segwit, the question of whether they would make spending already existing outputs more efficient arises. Unfortunately, the answer is no because the redemption instructions for existing outputs have already been set and do not incorporate these new features. However, this is good news because no one is forced to expose their funds to new cryptosystems whose security they may not trust. If sigagg is deployed, those who opt into using it will bear any cryptographic risk associated with it. In the future, if segwit-with-sigagg becomes universally accepted as at least as good as an old P2PKH, a consensus rule could be included in a hardfork that allows someone to spend scriptPubkey's matching specific templates as though they were an alternative template. The main limitation is the risk of breaking the security assumptions of some complicated external protocols. However, this concern can be addressed through ample communication in advance.</summary>
