    <summary>In a recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, the topic of low-S transactions violating the rule that "standard transactions must still work" was brought up. While some argue that the transformation to low-S is trivial, others suggest that the applicability of this principle depends on specific facts. For low-S transactions, several mitigating factors were identified as being important, including the ability for third parties to modify non-conforming transactions to conform and the fact that code to do so was already in use. Additionally, S-value malleation was being actively attacked at the time and the intention to eventually enforce lowS had been made clear long before implementation. These factors made it difficult for the change to result in the confiscation of funds, except in rare cases where unconfirmed chains of timelock transactions were already highly vulnerable due to malleation attacks. In such cases, collaboration with a miner may be necessary for redemption.</summary>
