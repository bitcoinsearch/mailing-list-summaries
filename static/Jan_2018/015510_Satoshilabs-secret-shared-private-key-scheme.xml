    <summary>The email exchange discusses the development of a new standard for Shamir Secret Scheme splitting. The specification includes a one-way function to protect the key, but the key derivation function is unconfigurable and weak, allowing for potential cracking. The lack of versioning could make interoperability difficult, and the 16-bit checksum based on sha2 is considered poor. The metadata does not afford much help to avoid accidentally mixing shares from distinct sharings of the same key. The email also notes that many people fail to generate additional coefficients of the polynomial randomly when using SSS, leading to insecurity.</summary>
