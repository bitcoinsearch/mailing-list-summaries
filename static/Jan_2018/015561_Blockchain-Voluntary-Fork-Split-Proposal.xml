    <summary>The proposed solution to address the scalability issue of blockchain is to hard fork the blockchain into two or more blockchains, with the same structure except for some identifiers that distinguish them. The coins on each blockchain cannot be transferred to the other one. This results in everyone receiving double bitcoins, with each having half the value of the original bitcoin. By doing this, the capacity of the original blockchain is theoretically doubled. When sending coins, the wallet should select one blockchain randomly and try to send through only one. The method is inspired by stock splits and aims to ensure that no previously owned asset value is lost. Unlike inflation in fiat money, where increased supply is released through debt expansion, voluntary split of bitcoin ensures there is no dilution of anyone's bitcoin assets.</summary>
