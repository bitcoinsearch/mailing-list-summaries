    <summary>Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin developer, brought up the idea of P2SH² improvements in the context of Bech32 protocol. He suggested that the address should include the single SHA256 hash of the public key or script, rather than RIPEMD160(SHA256(pubkey)) or SHA256(SHA256(script)). This would enable relaying the "middle-hash" as a way to prove the final hash is a hash itself and not embedded data spam. However, he also stated that P2SH² wasn't a serious proposal and it wouldn't be good for the ecosystem to add more address diversity at this time. Furthermore, people rushed Bech32 to market without any public reviews. Luke suggests working on an address-next proposal that has an explicit timeframe of N years out. The proposal should have layered hashing along with coded expiration times and abilities to have amounts under checksum, which are worth consideration.</summary>
