    <summary>In a conversation between Matt Corallo and Wladimir on January 31, 2012, Matt mentions changing "mustimplement" to "req" for brevity while still maintaining the intended meaning. He also explicitly states that numbers should not contain commas and should use periods to separate whole numbers and fractional decimal fractions to avoid any localization concerns. Wladimir suggests using a shorter prefix than "mustimplement" to keep URL sizes small for QR codes and other purposes but likes the original idea. Matt acknowledges the potential limitations of relying on variable names for backward compatibility and asks for alternative suggestions.</summary>
