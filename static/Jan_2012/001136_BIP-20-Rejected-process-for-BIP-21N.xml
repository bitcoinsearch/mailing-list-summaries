    <summary>In a discussion on January 31, 2012, slush proposed the idea of using satoshis instead of decimal bitcoin. The concern was that handling decimal numbers across all implementations is problematic, and not just limited to json-rpc. However, it was pointed out that switching to satoshis could lead to confusion for those working with things at COIN scale since they would have to multiply numbers stored as radix-2 floating point to get satoshis. This could lead to incorrect calculations and errors. On the other hand, using decimal numbers allows values to be treated as strings, preventing arithmetic that could potentially cause confusion.</summary>
