    <summary>In this context, the discussion is about changing the name of a variable from "req:something" to one of the unreserved characters that do not have to be URL encoded, as recommended in RFC 3986 on URI schemes. The colon is a reserved general delimiter for URNs and other similar purposes. Four options were suggested: Option A: req_something (underscore), Option B: req-something (hyphen), Option C: req~something (tilde), and Option D: req.something (period). They decided to change it to a hyphen and Andreas proposed using an unrestricted character instead of a colon. It was noted that sources other than the RFC itself can be useful.</summary>
