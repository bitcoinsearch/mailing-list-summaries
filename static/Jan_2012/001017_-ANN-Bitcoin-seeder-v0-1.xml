    <summary>Pieter has tagged v0.1.0 of his bitcoin-seeder program on github. This program powers the DNS seed on seed.bitcoin.sipa.be and is a crawler for the bitcoin network with an integrated DNS server. It's a preview release with minimal functionality and some missing features such as logging, configuration options and daemonization. However, it has been running without any issues on Pieter's node for over a week now, so he decided to release it. The program regularly dumps its database in dnsseed.dat for fast reinitialization, but Pieter cannot guarantee the compatibility of the file format with future versions since the program is far from finished. He welcomes comments and questions about the program.</summary>
