    "header_summary": "The latest version 26.1 of Bitcoin Core has been released, introducing several enhancements and bug fixes to improve user experience and wallet functionality, including transaction scanning adjustments, keypool management for descriptor wallets, and RPC fixes. Notable improvements also extend to P2P and network operations with the introduction of developments such as I2P session creation and enhanced block processing protocols. This version, which is available for download from the [Bitcoin Core website](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-26.1/) or via BitTorrent, continues to support older wallet versions and emphasizes increased stability and security through updates like a hardened runtime for macOS builds. The release is a product of a collaborative effort within the Bitcoin Core development community, involving contributors from core functionality developers to translators.\n\nThe Constellation project unveils an L3 protocol aimed at addressing user experience challenges inherent in the first two layers of blockchain technology, such as delayed transaction confirmations and escalating transaction fees. By incorporating a variety of protocols and technologies, the project introduces a federated security model bolstered by a ROAST wrapper around the FROST protocol for BIP 340 compatible Schnorr signatures, a UTXO-based ledger system for efficient consensus, and high transaction throughput. Constellation's design promotes anonymity, seamless transactions across operators and guilds, and provides a conducive environment for developers to create L3 wallets that are compatible with Bitcoin's UTXO model and scripting language.\n\nA focused discussion within the community explores the conditions under which transactions without confirmation, specifically those originating from a swap with the same party (0-conf offchain operations), can be considered trustworthy. The comparison between swap-in-potentiam (SIP) and payjoin-in-potentiam (PIP) reveals SIP's appeal for its simplicity and user convenience, especially for mobile wallet users, while PIP is noted for its fee-saving potential and privacy enhancements. This conversation highlights the critical balance between innovation and reliability in protocol development, advocating for the integrity and security of transactions amidst technological advancements.",
