    "header_summary": "SeedHammer is developing a new descriptor format for metal engraved backups, utilizing PSBT binary encoding to create a standard yet compact descriptor, in line with Bitcoin Improvement Proposals BIPs 380-386 and BIP 389. Their method, which aims to be Miniscript-compatible, includes a self-referential system with metadata embedded through PSBT map entries but limits certain expressions and inline keys.\n\nThe community is divided on using CBOR versus PSBT for encoding, with Blockchain Commons favoring the established CBOR, while SeedHammer advocates for PSBT based on its simplicity and existing wallet support. Moreover, discussions are ongoing on whether to introduce this new format with a distinct header or as an extension to the existing PSBT framework.\n\nSeedHammer is actively soliciting community feedback on their development to enhance their proposal before formalizing it through the BIP process. They have provided extensive resources, including a detailed proposal, an implementation guide, and an interactive playground, accessible via the provided links: [proposal], [implementation], and [playground].",
