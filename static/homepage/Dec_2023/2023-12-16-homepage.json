    "header_summary": "The Lightning Network's vulnerability to \"forced expiration spam\" attacks, where attackers flood the network with transactions, could be mitigated by the implementation of Feerate-Dependent Timelocks (FDTs). These timelocks dynamically adjust during high transaction fee periods, making attacks more expensive and time-consuming, and are resistant to miner manipulation. The adoption of FDTs would involve a consensus rule change in Bitcoin, utilizing the nSequence and nLocktime fields, with minimal additional memory and computational demands.\n\nFDTs not only counteract spam attacks but also offer broader security benefits against fee spikes and double-spend attacks, improving upon concerns initially underestimated in the Bitcoin whitepaper. The method promises enhanced fee-penalty calculations and reduced risks in one-shot receive scenarios. For a deeper dive into FDTs, interested individuals can refer to thorough discussions and code in a detailed paper and the associated GitHub repositories.\n\nOverall, FDTs present a strategic update to bolster transaction security and reliability within the Bitcoin network. Their integration suggests a significant advancement in protecting against various network attacks while maintaining capital efficiency, supporting the case for a consensus rule update to incorporate FDTs into Bitcoin's transaction protocol.",
