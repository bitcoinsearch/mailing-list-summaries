    "header_summary": "A newly developed protocol rooted in Kerckhoff's principle enhances the security and commercial viability of digital asset self-custody by being coercion-resistant and compatible with existing cryptographic technologies such as multi-signature and Shamir's Secret Sharing. Its straightforward design facilitates easy integration with current practices and paves the way for distributed services akin to the Lightning Network, potentially accelerating widespread adoption.\n\nIn parallel, a pioneering public-key cryptosystem has been introduced, predicated on the complex task of factoring polynomials over finite fields. Although still in its nascent phase, comprehensive resources are available for those interested in the technical aspects of both the coercion-resistant protocol and the new cryptosystem, highlighting the ongoing efforts to fortify digital asset security and extend the frontiers of cryptographic research.",
