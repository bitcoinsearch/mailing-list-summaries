    "header_summary": "The Lightning Network's security is set to be bolstered by the introduction of Feerate-Dependent Timelocks (FDTs), a mechanism designed to deter \"forced expiration spam\" attacks. These attacks have plagued the network by overwhelming it with mass-closures of channels, but FDTs aim to counter this by dynamically extending timelocks in response to increased blockchain congestion and fees, making it cost-prohibitive for attackers. FDTs leverage the nSequence field in transactions, ensuring they adhere to set timelocks and fees with minimal changes to the current Bitcoin consensus rules.\n\nMoreover, FDTs provide a dual layer of protection, safeguarding the network from both spam attacks and dishonest miner manipulations. By adapting to fluctuating blockchain conditions, FDTs maintain capital efficiency while also offering users defense against unexpected fee surges and refining fee penalty calculations, relevant to Lightning Network transactions and channel factories. This enhancement corrects previous underestimations of double-spend attack risks by considering complex miner strategies.\n\nDespite requiring extra DRAM and computational resources, the integration of FDTs into the Bitcoin protocol promises a significant increase in systemic resilience against double-spend attacks. The full implications and technical specifics of FDTs are thoroughly examined in a detailed paper and available on a GitHub repository, underscoring their critical role in strengthening the Lightning Network's infrastructure and aligning with established consensus rules.",
