    <summary>The proposal is for a hard fork to prevent replay attacks, which occur when transactions from one network are duplicated on another network. The proposal suggests adding a "network characteristic byte" as the most significant byte of the nVersion field of a transaction to denote up to 8 networks sharing a common history. Additionally, the proposal outlines rules for the new and existing networks, including that anti-replay should be an option, not mandatory, and that transactions created before the proposal would not be protected from anti-replay. The proposal also aims to fix the O(n^2) signature checking bug for non-segregated witness inputs. The proposal does have limitations, such as the inability to protect transactions made before the proposal, and it is up to the designer of a hard fork to decide whether to respect the proposal. A demo implementation of the proposal is available in the forcenet2 branch of Github.</summary>
