    <summary>In a discussion about hard fork proposal on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Matt Corallo suggested that to maximize fork divergence, requiring transaction version 2 for all previously-signed transactions might make sense. However, Gavin Andresen disagreed, arguing that compatibility with existing transaction-signing software and hardware should be considered. He suggested that any hard fork proposal should support a reasonable number of old-sighash transactions to allow a smooth transition of wallet software and hardware, as well as support anyone who might have a hardware wallet locked away in a safe deposit box for years. Nonetheless, he acknowledged that some limits on UTXO-chain-from-before-the-fork-length may be necessary, and it might be prudent to move towards only allowing one transaction per block from the old mode over time. Overall, Andresen believed that wallets which can upgrade should upgrade to a new form to maximize chain divergence, since they will have to upgrade to know a new header format anyway.</summary>
