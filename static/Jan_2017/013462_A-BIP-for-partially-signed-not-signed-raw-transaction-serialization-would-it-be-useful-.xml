    <summary>The author has been experiencing issues with serialization of partially signed multisig raw transactions across different projects such as Electrum, Copay, Coinb.in, Bitcoin Core, etc. and is seeking opinions before proposing a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal). The author believes that all should be on the same page when serializing not-signed and partially signed transactions to enable anyone to look at the data alone and know what is necessary and how to manipulate it to sign and complete the transaction. The author has also provided a PGP public key block in the context.</summary>
