    <summary>The discussion is regarding a proposal to fix the replay attack issue. Under the proposed solution, after the hardfork, Bob can still confirm the old style time-locked transaction on both networks by sending the outputs to himself again with a different transaction format. This ensures that the transaction cannot be replayed as it requires a child transaction in the same block that is unique to the network. The policy change will ensure that pre-signed transactions cannot be replayed by anyone except the owner of the coins who must spend them immediately in the child transaction. Once spent, the unspent transaction output (UTXO) sets will diverge across the two networks.</summary>
