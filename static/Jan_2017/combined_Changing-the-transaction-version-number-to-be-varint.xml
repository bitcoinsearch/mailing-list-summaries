    <summary>The email thread discusses the possibility of changing the way the version number is serialized in a transaction format, which would save 3 bytes in each transaction. The proposed change can be done through a soft fork from a certain block-height by labeling bytes 2, 3 &amp; 4 as unused and interpreting the first byte as varint. However, there are concerns that this would be a hardfork because existing nodes will not be able to deserialize the new transaction format. Additionally, there is currently no consensus rule that rejects transactions that lie about their version number, so the proposed rule cannot be introduced retroactively. The email thread also mentions three ways to introduce new transaction formats: through a softfork, through a hardfork, or p2p only.</summary>
