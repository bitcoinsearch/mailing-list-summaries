    <summary>The proposal for a Decentralized Service Provider (DSP) has been suggested to grant end users access to the Lightning Network. This would allow them to send and receive more money through much larger channels. The DSP would consist of several entities, geographically distributed, that manage Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals, Lightning Network Channel(s), and communication with end-users and the Lightning Network. Deposit addresses for the DSP are multi-sig addresses, requiring a majority of DSP's entities to sign any withdrawals or transactions.Communication between DSP entities and their end-users is done via signed messages which makes everything provable. If an entity acts maliciously, other entities can exclude it from the DSP by transferring control of managed Bitcoins and channels to new multi-sig addresses/channels that don't require the malicious entity's signature. Fewer channels are required with DSPs than Lightning alone, thus saving more space on the Blockchain. However, one limitation is that service providers will need to promote themselves in open as they cannot be anonymous and hide behind TOR due to the risk of DDoS attacks.</summary>
