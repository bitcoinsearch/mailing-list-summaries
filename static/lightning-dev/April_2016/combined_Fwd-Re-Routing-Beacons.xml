    <summary>Rusty Russell explains the use of "landmarks" instead of "beacons" in payment channels in a mailing list conversation. While discussing the pulse protocol, which is based on beacons and updates routing tables, Rusty confirms that to a first approximation, all payments go through selected beacon nodes. However, if the route goes in and out of the same channel, it can be eliminated. When Laurentmt asks about an update strategy for routing tables, Rusty suggests several ways to do routing via a known set of landmarks. They also discuss the two variables that determine the best route: capacity of channels at time t and fees charged by nodes. Rusty suggests that payments are generally smaller than channel capacity, and pricing information is dynamic and needs careful thought. Rusty's current idea involves ratelimiting pricing updates and phasing price changes over time. Moreover, there is the question of how to handle false advertising, with Rusty suggesting that you should be able to broadcast the response from a node that refuses to route your payment. If one node signs an invalid message, it can be blacklisted temporarily.</summary>
