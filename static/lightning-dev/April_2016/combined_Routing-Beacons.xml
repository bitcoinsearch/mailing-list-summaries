    <summary>Laurentmt is seeking information about routing based on beacons in the Lightning Network (LN). The concept involves routing through a set of known landmarks which can be achieved in various ways. The user is interested in finding the cheapest route to and from each beacon, which can be broadcasted as the best route known. However, since rates are expressed as "base + per-satoshi-amount," determining the cheapest route will require some heuristics due to variations in amounts. The idea is not exactly similar to the Pulse Protocol, which computes spanning trees rooted at beacon nodes periodically.</summary>
