    <summary>Laurentmt is seeking information about the concept of routing based on beacons in the Lightning Network (LN). This involves finding the cheapest route to and from each beacon, which can then be broadcasted as the best route known. However, since rates are expressed as "base + per-satoshi-amount", determining the cheapest route depends on the amount and requires some heuristics. The user also asks if this concept is similar to the Pulse Protocol, which involves periodic computation of spanning trees rooted at beacon nodes.</summary>
