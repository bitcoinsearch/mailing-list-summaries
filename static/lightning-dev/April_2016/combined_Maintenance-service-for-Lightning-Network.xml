    <summary>The email thread discusses the author's interest in adding Lightning Network (LN) to their Bitcoin wallet and how it could work for end-users. The sender needs at least three pieces of "core" data before interacting with LN, including the required hash of R-value, a list of "full node" URLs where the receiver currently has open channels, and a list of receiver IDs for each "full node." Additionally, the sender may want optional metadata such as name, picture, and address. To avoid confusion, the "Lightning address" and QR-code approach won't work as R-value should be unique. The "core" data should come directly from the receiver's device, either via the internet or locally through Bluetooth, WiFiP2P, NFC, etc.There is also a discussion on how routing data works in the Lightning Network, and the process of making an initial payment request. One suggestion is for both devices to establish a socket connection to current landmark nodes, although this could be overwhelming for both devices and landmark nodes. Another possibility is a deterministic method that determines what exact node a user's ID should connect to, which could distribute the load across the network. There are concerns about DDoS attacks, which could spam a Lightning device with millions of payment requests. Rusty proposes a solution where nodes have an ID and publish their public routes by proving they own the anchor transactions for their channels, with information on routes to and from landmarks stored by every node. Additionally, there is a need for stable identities on devices, encryption for transferring core data, and the possibility of a service parallel to LN that can transfer core data in encrypted form. However, offline receive is deemed much harder and not planned for 1.0 spec. The author suggests that users should be able to generate stable identities on their devices using EC25519 keys because of their small size and applicability for both encryption and signing. There also needs to be a service parallel to LN that can transfer "core" data in encrypted form while optionally acting as a third-party watcher for broadcasted commitment transactions and a "name authority" for users who supplied metadata along with their public keys.Kumaigorodskiy Anton has asked for clarification on how routing data works in Lightning Network and how an initial payment request can be made. Rusty suggests providing information via QR code or other means. General messages over the network will not be routed in the short term. The email thread also discusses concerns about DDoS attacks, which could spam a Lightning device with millions of payment requests. Rusty proposes mitigating such attacks via requests rationing using blind signatures but is unsure how to enforce it on a distributed network.</summary>
