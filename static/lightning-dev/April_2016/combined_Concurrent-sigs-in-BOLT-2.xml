    <summary>The email exchange between Rusty Russell and Pierre discusses how to handle concurrent signatures, with Pierre suggesting an ordering system to resolve conflicts. The proposed solution involves two nodes agreeing on the "greatest" signature and then having the lesser signature resend a new signature that includes all pending changes. A diagram provided demonstrates how nodes track two commitment states and the rules they must follow when processing packets. Rusty Russell addresses concerns about nodes getting stuck in an infinite loop while sending each other new HTLCs instead of immediately sending a new SIG, noting that committed HTLCs are locked in and the receiver cannot offer them onwards until then. He also emphasizes the importance of estimating the deadline for successful redemption for each offered HTLC and not offering a HTLC past the deadline. Finally, he believes that there should be no restriction on the number of updates between signatures.</summary>
