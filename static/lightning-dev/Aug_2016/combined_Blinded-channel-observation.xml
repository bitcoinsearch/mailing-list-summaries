    <summary>In an email exchange between Joseph Poon and Rusty Russell, the need for a "filter hint" to prevent an excessive amount of outsourcing work in the Lightning Network is discussed. Two options are presented: using an index based on txid or HMAC-ing the transaction itself. The latter option is preferred due to its low computational cost, but there is a risk of reintroducing malleability if the witness is included in the HMAC. To address this, randomness can be inserted into the transaction or the input signature from the witness can be extracted as a filter.Rusty Russell also raises concerns about the security of the Lightning Network and suggests using an HMAC of the non-witness transaction in shachain/elkrem. The use of a revocation key method compatible with shachain/elkrem that has log(n) storage is described. A script is developed that omits hashing in the commit script and uses only signature verification, consisting of DUP, [Revocable Pubkey], CHECKSIG, NOTIF, [Timeout Pubkey], CHECKSIGVERIFY, [timeout period], and CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY. The observer design is still in progress, but it will be scalable and able to recognize stored txids.Tadge Dryja discusses the issue of channel utilization in LN and states with in-flight HTLCs. Rusty Russell suggests sending the observer the "steal" tx every update, encrypted+HMAC with the txid of the commit tx or SHA256() of our signature on the commit tx. The email conversation also discusses different methods of outsourcing work and reducing computational cost when watching multiple channels.In a mailing list thread, the proposed solution involves pre-computing HMAC by the outsourcer. The outsourcer takes the tx. There are suggestions for using one's input signature as the key for the encrypted blob, which helps to encourage more nodes to download witness data. Tadge Dryja proposed using HMAC to compare transactions against a key-value store in the Lightning Network, but this method becomes inefficient when watching multiple channels.To optimize privacy and data tradeoff, the watcher can gather HTLCs from previous requests. The Lightning Network uses an encrypted protocol to transmit transactions without revealing their contents, but Hashed TimeLock Contracts (HTLCs) make hiding the channel tricky. The author proposes using truncated TXIDs as identifiers for observers and decryption keys for constant-time lookups into the observer's database.In a conversation about revocable pubkeys, Alice and Bob discuss changing the timeout key to improve channel privacy. Joseph Poon suggests an alternative method where only revocation hashes/pubkeys are sent instead of revocations themselves. In another discussion, Tadge Dryja proposes using seek access time and putting all watched txids into the same tree to reduce CPU and I/O cost per incoming transaction regardless of the number of separate channels being watched. He also suggests adding randomness to the tx and extracting input signature from the witness to optimize privacy.Rusty Russell hopes for the ability for Alice and Bob to independently predict each other's future revocation hashes/pubkeys, allowing an arbitrary number of commitment transactions in flight each way at once. Joseph Poon and Rusty Russell discuss different schemes for reducing space and communication requirements per new commitment transaction in the Lightning Network. They discuss the use of revocation keys in shachain/elkrem for log(n) storage and Tadge Dryja's method that uses only signature verification instead of hashing. Poon suggests an alternative method where only revocation hashes/pubkeys are sent instead of revocations themselves.Rusty Russell and Joseph Poon discussed the use of hash trees in Bitcoin transactions via email. They explored the idea of using a tree of chained preimages and hashes as part of the tree itself to save wire usage, rather than predicting each other's future revocation hashes/pubkeys. This chain would look like preimage-&gt;hash-&gt;preimage-&gt;hash instead of preimage-&gt;preimage. The wire message would only need to send next_revocation_hash, with the prior revocation preimage being revealed automatically. Pubkey revocations would require privkeys+pubkeys instead of preimages+hashes, which ups the cost/complexity. However, they agreed that sticking with hash trees was better unless a significant win is achieved.</summary>
