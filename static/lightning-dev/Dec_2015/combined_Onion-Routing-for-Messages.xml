    <summary>The proposed system for ensuring privacy in payment transactions uses Onion Routing, which encrypts payments over a rendezvous point. The author suggests a messaging system integrated into the routing process, where each node could encrypt and append the pubkey of the node it received the object from together with the ephemeral key used initially. However, there are potential issues with this design, such as a possible security risk if someone obtains the onion object and 'hunts down' the sender by targeting the nodes consisting of the route one by one. Additionally, it is difficult to provide reasonable DoS protection against nodes spamming the network with unnecessary messages. Mats Jerratsch and Rusty Russell discussed the use of onion routing for sending messages over the Lightning network. The conversation addressed the issue of preferences for what should be sent through onion routing versus what shouldn't. Rusty suggested that reinventing a peer-to-peer messaging network seems outside scope, but there's nothing stopping them from doing so in a future revision.In an email conversation on December 8, 2015, Mats Jerratsch raised the question of whether onion-routing should be one-time and one-directional. The preferences regarding what data is to be sent through onion routing are unclear. Jerratsch suggests implementing an interactive wallet-to-wallet protocol while both sides are busy communicating with the onion routing network for actual payment route negotiation. Once a path is found, the recipient would then communicate over the wallet-to-wallet channel to pass over the fully-constructed onion routing information. However, defining the wallet-to-wallet channel and which techniques could/should be used without leaking information may be an issue.</summary>
