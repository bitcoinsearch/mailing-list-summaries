    <summary>Bitcoin developers have been discussing cleaner solutions for revealing private keys in the context of HTLCs and payments that pay to multiple payment keys. Two approaches were proposed, one involving generating a signature with P that has 15 leading zero bytes or more, while the other involves multisig verification and coming up with secret keys Q' and R' based on transaction hashes h1, h2, and h3. However, Rusty Russell pointed out that the second approach may not work if sigA, sigB, and sigC all share the same r and SIGHASH settings.Another proposal by Anthony Towns suggests using elliptic curve (EC) keys to ensure payment correctness, but it requires a new operator OP_CHECKPRIVPUBKEYPAIR to enforce a payment with a priv/pub key pair. There are also issues with routing transactions from one party to another. Furthermore, Mats Jerratsch provided a BIP request for finding cleaner solutions for revealing private keys, which could be achieved through the use of EC keys or SNARKS.Andrew Miller suggests that using a SNARK may be useful in this context. However, in a post on the Linux Foundation's mailing list in 2015, Miller questioned the need for SNARKs and suggested that an interactive Zero-Knowledge proof using Yao garbled circuits might be sufficient for their needs. In a separate thread, aj stated that using SNARK was unnecessary for a specific application as ECC multiply and addition were already being used for crypto.Anthony Towns proposed a method for adding privacy to hash time-locked contracts (HTLCs) using pseudocode translation into script. The Lightning Network has a privacy limitation where different hops can be associated as part of the same transaction due to sharing a common R value. The solution to this problem lies in the magic of SNARKs (Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge).Rusty Russell and Anthony Towns discussed the introduction of new opcodes with the segregated witness proposal. While Russell believed that it would be easy to introduce new opcodes, Towns did not understand how this was possible. The author of an email response to a previous message about SNARKs notes that while SNARKs may not be necessary, it's impressive that the sender tried them out.The email then shifts to a separate discussion about the segregated witness proposal and new opcodes in SW script. Lastly, in an email conversation, Anthony Towns proposed using SHA(ECDH_SEC || 3) as the r values at each stage instead of needing additional entropy or adding significant data to the onion packets. The burden for keeping the payment private falls entirely on the consumer, rather than the merchant. Andrew Miller suggests that using a SNARK may be useful in this context, but ZKPs require perfect implementation to work as intended.</summary>
