    <summary>A new method for hubs and centralization in the lightning network has been proposed by the author of a recent GitHub gist. The current system requires reserves for each payment channel, which can tie up funds in many channels. The proposed solution involves creating a metatoken/coloured coin on top of bitcoin to eliminate the need for reserves. The hub would provide Hectorcoins in the other direction, which the node can sell back to the hub for bitcoin if they're net positive.However, this basic example requires counterparty trust in Hector. The email discusses the possibility of lowering the capital requirement in order to lower the barrier for people wishing to run a Lightning Network node. The writer proposes a trust-based system that resembles a fractional-reserve banking system. The writer believes that such fractional-reserve hubs will provide lower transaction fees because of lower capital requirements and the idea is worth pursuing. Additionally, they believe it may be possible to design a proof-of-solvency which could replace the existing fractional-reserve system. The writer invites John to connect on Skype to discuss the matter further and acknowledges his accessible writing style.</summary>
