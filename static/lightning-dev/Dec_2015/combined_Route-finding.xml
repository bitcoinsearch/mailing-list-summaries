    <summary>The article discusses an idea for neighbors of beacon nodes to discover when a neighbor has become a beacon, which will then be propagated to other neighbors. The purpose of this discovery is not detailed, but it could have applications in tracking or monitoring devices in a network. However, the context does not provide any additional information beyond this idea.The author of the post is seeking information on how nodes can find routes between themselves and beacon nodes without using floodfill search, as they believe it may not be scalable. The author is looking for a summary of the latest ideas on this topic.</summary>
