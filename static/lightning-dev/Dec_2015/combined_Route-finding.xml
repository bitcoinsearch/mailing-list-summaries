    <summary>The post's author is looking for information on how nodes and beacon nodes can find routes between themselves without using floodfill search. They are concerned about scalability issues and are seeking the latest ideas on this topic. The proposed idea involves neighbors of beacon nodes discovering when one of their neighbors becomes a beacon, which is then propagated to other neighbors to minimize traffic. The purpose of this discovery is not explained in detail but could potentially have applications in tracking or monitoring devices in a network. However, there is no additional information provided beyond this idea, leaving much open to interpretation.</summary>
