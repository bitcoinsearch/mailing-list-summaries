    <summary>The Lightning Network relies on public key cryptography for routing keys, anchor keys, and p2p keys. Routing keys are used for constructing the onion, anchor keys are used for spending the anchor transaction and signing commitment transactions, and p2p keys are used for establishing a shared secret when talking to a node. The email thread discusses the potential risks associated with linking network addresses and lightning ids since revealing a network address can lead to physical identity exposure, making it easy for denial-of-service attacks, and point of entry for targeted hacking to steal money. To mitigate the risks, Mats Jerratsch proposes adding the IP-PubKey-relationship to the gossip protocol, while Anthony Towns highlights the need to treat the relationship between a network address and the lightning network address as sensitive.In addition, Rusty Russell proposed using a session nonce to improve security after the first handshake in a system. Although the nonce can help with correlation, it needs to change to maintain security. ECDH of node ids would be the obvious shared secret to use as a base, but determining what constitutes a successful handshake is vague and may require allowing +/- 1 nonce. Finally, there are suggestions to handle the first option through a "fund a new channel by lightning transaction" operation, which includes Alice's network address in the payment instructions to Bob, and replacing the nonce X with X and Y to prevent attackers from verifying which of Alice's connections is Bob during a MITM attack.</summary>
