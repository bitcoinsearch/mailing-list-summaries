    <summary>Joining a Google Group is possible without having a Gmail account by sending a subscription request to a certain endpoint. While this method doesn't grant access to the web interface, which offers valuable features like searching and archiving, there is a workaround for users without a Gmail account. By associating a non-Gmail email with a Google Account, one can use the group's web UI without the need to adopt Gmail for regular emailing.

Groups.io presents itself as an alternative platform that supports email integration and provides a migration path from Mailman, the current underlying system in use. It emphasizes its web interface while still prioritizing email functionality. This service could serve as a potential replacement that respects the primacy of email communication within a group setting.

The favored solution among the options seems to be Discourse. It stands out for its ability to display images and LaTeX beautifully, along with offering organizational features such as tags and categories. Importantly, Discourse can operate in 'email list mode', enabling users to interact purely via email if they choose not to engage with the website directly. The email list mode replicates traditional mailing list functionalities, ensuring users who prefer email can continue to communicate in a familiar way while benefiting from Discourse's enhanced features.</summary>
