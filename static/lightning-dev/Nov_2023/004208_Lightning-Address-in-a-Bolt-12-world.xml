    <summary>Tony has expressed concerns regarding Bastien's first option for implementing a new system that appears to require only a single DNS entry to support unlimited users on "serviceprovider.com." He points out that the distinction between the roles of "bob" and "domain owner" in Bastien's explanation is ambiguous, suggesting that clarity would be helpful in understanding what responsibilities fall to the service provider versus the domain-owning user. Tony appreciates the simplicity that the system seems to offer semi-technical users, who can set it up without needing to run a web server.

However, Tony shares from his development experience that managing thousands or even millions of DNS entries programmatically in real-time is not common among developers he knows, which might pose a significant barrier to adoption. He highlights the importance of ensuring the transition from LNURL to LNDNS and from bolt11 to bolt12 is streamlined, fearing that the proposed method could inadvertently increase the complexity of this migration process.

Tony is seeking clarification on whether the one-time DNS entry mentioned in option 1 indeed suffices for all users. Despite his reservations, he indicates general support for the proposal, pending this clarification. Tony's inquiry demonstrates a desire to ensure that the new system is both developer-friendly and scalable without imposing undue technical demands.</summary>
