    <summary>Tony's email addresses the technical considerations regarding the implementation of bolt12 within the LNURL framework, particularly focusing on the challenges associated with DNS entries. He acknowledges Bastien's previous concerns about the scalability of relying on DNS when service providers might need to cater to a large user base, ranging from thousands to millions. Tony suggests that using Oblivious HTTP could be a viable solution for LNURL service providers, as it could potentially mitigate the issue of exposing IP addresses for larger entities.

Furthermore, Tony expresses interest in seeing a practical demonstration or example of how bolt12 would operate under the 'normal' LNURL procedures. His request implies a search for a more concrete understanding of the integration and its potential implications. The email indicates ongoing discussions about the technical strategies to optimize the LNURL service infrastructure for scalability and privacy, reflecting the collaborative nature of development in this area.</summary>
