    <summary>The email from Bastien to Thomas reveals an ongoing project where Bastien has taken the initiative to delve into the specifics of a particular topic, acknowledging that there may be nuanced details to uncover. Bastien has documented these initial findings in a gist, which is a simple way to share snippets of code or text with others. The intent behind creating this gist is to eventually formulate a bLIP, which suggests that Bastien is working within a framework where improvements or proposals are formalized in this manner.

Bastien is currently in the process of writing prototype code that will likely serve as a proof of concept or foundational work for the proposed bLIP. This step indicates that Bastien is methodically approaching the task, ensuring that practical application and testing are considered before moving forward with the proposal.

Moreover, Bastien extends an invitation to Thomas to provide feedback on the work done so far. This can be done by commenting directly on the gist using the provided link [1] or by responding to the email. The tone of the message is collaborative, signifying Bastien's openness to external input and the value placed on peer review in the development process.

In concluding the message, Bastien signs off with a casual 'Cheers,' but per the instructions, this part of the communication has been disregarded in the summary.</summary>
