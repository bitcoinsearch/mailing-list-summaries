    <summary>There is news that the Linux Foundation will soon stop hosting mailing lists, which has prompted discussions on alternative platforms for community engagement and development discourse. A forum named "Delving Bitcoin" has been established to serve as a potential venue for such discussions, particularly focusing on lightning-related research and development topics. This forum can be beneficial for the community, as it offers the possibility of creating project-specific areas tailored to specific software projects like CLN, LND, Eclair, or particular features including BOLT-12, eltoo, or jamming mitigation strategies. The creation of these dedicated spaces would facilitate targeted discussions and collaborative efforts within the community with minimal setup effort required.</summary>
