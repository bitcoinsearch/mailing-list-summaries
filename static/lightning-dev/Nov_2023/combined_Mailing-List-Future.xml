    <summary>The conversation among programmers entails an exploration of various platforms to host future discussions due to the upcoming closure of the current mailing list. The possibility of using Google Groups for the mailing list was discussed, which allows joining without a Gmail account by sending a special email to a Google Groups endpoint, with the caveat that this would not grant access to the web UI for features like searching or archives. To circumvent this limitation, one could associate a non-Gmail email address with a Google Account to use the UI without needing to adopt Gmail for regular use.

An alternative to Google Groups is Groups.io, which provides a migration path from Mailman and emphasizes email as a primary method of interaction while also offering a web UI. However, personal preferences lean towards Discourse for its advanced features such as rendering for images and LaTeX, tags, categories, and the ability to run in email list mode. This mode allows users to interact with the platform purely via email without the need to visit the website itself.

A notable recommendation included hosting a new mailman instance, which would be managed by a volunteer and would remain fully moderated to prevent issues such as spam. Despite concerns about emails being marked as spam, particularly by Microsoft email services, it was believed that moderation could effectively mitigate these risks.

The option of utilizing GitHub discussions within the lightning organization was brought up, but there were reservations about the sufficiency of the moderation tools available on that platform. Additionally, the concept of creating a Discourse instance was suggested, with the potential for it to be self-hosted or set up under delvingbitcoin.com, thanks to AJ's offer to create a section for lightning discussions.

Despite the various options presented, no definitive consensus was reached during the discussion. To resolve this, a vote was scheduled for the next meeting, which will take place one week and a day from the time of the email exchange. The email indicated that the forthcoming meeting would feature a brief discussion before voting. Individuals interested in influencing the decision or ensuring their viewpoints are considered were encouraged to attend the meeting or respond to the current message, with the assurance from Matt, the author of the email, that he would present any feedback received at the said meeting.</summary>
