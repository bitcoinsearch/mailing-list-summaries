    <summary>A recent meeting brought to light the need to find a new platform for hosting a mailing list due to the shutdown of the current system before the end of the year. Several options were considered, among which Google Groups was mentioned; however, concerns were raised about its accessibility for non-Gmail users. The idea of using GitHub discussions within the lightning organization was also put forward, but the capability of its moderation tools was questioned.

An alternative solution discussed involved setting up a new mailman instance, and the author of the email volunteered to manage this setup, expressing confidence in handling the moderation effectively despite some concerns about emails potentially being marked as spam by Microsoft email services. Moreover, the option of using a Discourse instance was also presented, with the possibility of either self-hosting or using an existing setup provided by delvingbitcoin.com, where AJ has proposed creating a dedicated section for lightning discussions.

The deliberations on choosing the most suitable platform remained inconclusive during the informal discussion, leading to the decision that a vote will be held after a concise debate at the next meeting. To ensure comprehensive representation of opinions, the author invites all interested parties to participate in the upcoming meeting scheduled for one week and a day from now, or to respond to the current email. Matt has pledged to bring any feedback received to the forthcoming meeting to inform the final decision-making process.</summary>
