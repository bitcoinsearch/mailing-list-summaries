    <summary>In the email from Bastien, a technical discourse is presented on the implications of using DNS records versus storing data directly on a service provider's web server. The conversation hinges on the privacy concerns and technical feasibility of handling payment-related data, where the use of DNS records is suggested as an alternative to having data fetched over HTTPSâ€”this latter method potentially compromises user privacy by revealing IP addresses and payment intent.

The sender refutes the notion that managing millions of entries in a zonefile is a significant challenge, suggesting it is a suitable task for service providers that do not wish to implement the more complex option 3. For simplicity, service providers can opt for option 1, which entails creating a single DNS record. This method allows for an empty blinded path if the service provider does not need to conceal its node_id, ensuring the record remains valid indefinitely unless there is a desire to change the node_id.

For clients, the process is straightforward. They are advised to utilize DNS over HTTPS (DoH) for their requests, bypassing the need for intricate integration into the DNS stack. Clients should prioritize option 3, resorting to option 1 only when necessary. The initial query is required occasionally; afterwards, the offer details can be stored in the contact list for repeated use until expiration, at which point the queries would be performed anew. The sender concludes the technical guidance without a formal sign-off, maintaining a focus on the informative content of the message.</summary>
