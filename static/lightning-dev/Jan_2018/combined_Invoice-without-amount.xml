    <summary>The Lightning Network's c-lightning command is currently unable to create amountless invoices through the "invoice" command, although it can pay them via the "pay" command. A contributor to the Lightning Network has expressed intentions to investigate how to enable the creation of amountless invoices in c-lightning. Rusty Russell, a developer, filed an issue on GitHub for this and recommended using a magic string instead of omitting the parameter for the msatoshi field to avoid potential bugs.A user on the lightning-dev mailing list raised concerns about c-lightning's inability to create amountless invoices via the "invoice" command. Rusty acknowledged the issue and filed it on GitHub while providing a solution for paying an amountless invoice in c-lightning. He advised using a magic string such as "any" rather than omitting the parameter to avoid bugs. Cezary Dziemian also inquired about whether Lightning Labs had plans to introduce a feature that would allow lnd to create amountless invoices or if they would have to switch to c-lightning. Rusty advised Cezary to make an issue on lnd's issue tracker instead of emailing. Another sender is seeking confirmation that the value for an invoice can be left empty in a Lightning Network invoice or if there is another way to send payment when the sender does not specify an amount. They referred to a Github link which details the payment encoding process for the Lightning Network.In short, c-lightning can currently pay but not create amountless invoices, and Rusty has filed an issue on GitHub to address this. The use of a magic string as opposed to omitting the parameter was suggested to avoid bugs. Lightning Labs' implementation, lnd, does not currently allow users to create amountless invoices via the "invoice" command, and inquiries about this should be made on lnd's issue tracker.</summary>
