    <summary>Jonathan Underwood, a member of the Lightning Network (LN) community, proposed a new feature that would allow users to pay with an open channel. Underwood's idea is that if the recipient of a payment waiting for a specific r_hash receives an open_channel message with push_msat greater than or equal to the value of the request where the temporary_channel_id contains the r_hash, that payment will be set to a WAITING_OPEN status. Once the channel is open, the payment moves to a PAID status. If a routed payment is received with the r_hash while waiting for the channel to open, the payment status changes to PAID. However, Rusty Russell, also of the LN community, responded with some concerns about this proposal. Russell believes that it may be better to simply open a channel and then make a payment rather than using push_msat. He also pointed out that open_channel can take up to 10 minutes, but most smartphone apps kill background network processes for apps after 5 minutes or so. Additionally, routing payments can fail, and Russell suggested that in these cases, a wallet UI should ask the user whether they want to open a channel and send, send on-chain, or give up. Russell noted that allowing the person to "pay" with an open_channel introduces trust into the system, and he doesn't believe adjustments should be made based on such a falsifiable signal. Lastly, Russell mentioned that if this feature were to be added, it would be a 1.1 thing since the spec is frozen other than outright bugs. The proposed feature might be a good addition to BOLT 2, but it still needs further discussion and evaluation to ensure its practicality and efficiency.</summary>
