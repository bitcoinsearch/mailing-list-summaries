    <summary>The Lightning Network protocol has been under discussion regarding the possibility of allowing negative fees to incentivize unwinding in scenarios where nodes consider it to be cheaper than on-chain rebalancing. Although negative fees were allowed in the original implementation of the protocol, Rusty Russell found this to be a strange idea that complicated routing. However, Mark Friedenbach believes that there are situations where negative fees could be helpful, such as when the network becomes too weighted on one side of the graph or when the other side is a non-routable endpoint. The discussion also highlights the importance of negative shadow prices for optimal constrained network markets, specifically in regard to flows in opposite directions canceling out. The example of FTRs was given to support this point. Benjamin Mord suggests that the decision to treat negative fees as 0 should be left up to individual routing implementations, but he believes that the protocol itself should support negative fees.However, it has been argued that negative fees add unnecessary complexity to routing and can result in less control over the rebalancing process, which can cause losses or forward rejections. Rebalancing can be accomplished by finding a cycle and sending a payment back to oneself, while allowing only positive fees simplifies routing and still allows for active rebalancing. Any other applications can be negotiated out of band or in the onion payload for that node. Overall, while exploring specific applications of lightning to different markets is an opportunity for collaborative and complimentary work, it is important to be careful not to distract the Lightning project from its already ambitious mission.</summary>
