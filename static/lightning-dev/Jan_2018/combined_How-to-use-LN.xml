    <summary>The Lightning protocol is discussed by two individuals, with one asking whether end clients are included in the use of the protocol. The conversation then shifts to building a server-client model where multiple merchants can accept payments from end customers, but it is stated that neither c-lightning nor Lightning Charge is multi-tenant. Therefore, it is recommended to build a layer in-between to differentiate tenants and control access to individual resources. Every user should run their own nodes instead of relying on large managed infrastructure.A user named v e wants to use Lightning Charge API for a merchant app and consumer wallet app using Bitcoinj APIs for wallet creation and asks if they need to run a Bitcoin Core node to integrate with the LN. They also ask how invoices are generated through the invoice APIs provided by the LN and how they can tie the merchant wallet to the invoice. Christian Decker advises against exposing lightningd to multiple tenants, recommends building a layer in between, and suggests every user should run their own nodes. He explains that to use Lightning Charge, a full bitcoind node synced with the network, c-lightning node, and npm + lightning-charge running to give access to the REST API are necessary. Invoices are tracked by c-lightning and can be stored in a reference using the payment_hash.</summary>
