    <summary>The Lightning-dev mailing list has been discussing the issue of one side of a channel having complete control over it and whether this could be used to change fee size when closing channels. However, this would require trust in the other party, highlighting the importance of trust in the Lightning Network. Johan raises the issue of a mainnet channel force closed two weeks ago that is still not mined, suggesting SIGHASH flag magic as a solution. Meanwhile, Jonathan faces a problem with unilateral close due to CSV timelock and suggests using CPFPs to redeem the to_remote output, but script verification will fail and the CSV timer won't start. The discussion also touches upon potential issues with closing channels and offers solutions such as out-of-band fee payment mechanisms or using a Lightning transaction to pay for those services. In another message to the Bitcoin development mailing list, Jonathan poses the question of what happens when a channel partner disappears, leaving transactions at around 100 satoshi/byte that won't confirm due to insufficient fees. The to_local output cannot be redeemed until the commitment transaction is confirmed + the CSV timeout, but the to_remote output probably won't be redeemed as the other person is offline. Waiting for the other person to come online seems to be the only remedy, but since CSV will cause script verification to fail, a CPFP transaction will not be propagated. Some solutions suggested include using out-of-band fee payment mechanisms or using a Lightning transaction to pay for that service more cheaply than on-chain payments those existing accelerators currently use.</summary>
