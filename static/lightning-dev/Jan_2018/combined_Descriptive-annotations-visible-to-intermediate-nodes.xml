    <summary>The discussion between Benjamin Mord and Christian Decker centers around the possibility of adding annotations to Lightning Network transactions that can be read by all intermediate nodes along a given route, or only specific ones. The Lightning Network is built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain and enables faster and cheaper transactions. Annotations could potentially provide valuable information for users and merchants, although there are privacy implications to consider.Annotations would need to be added to the onion routing packet, which contains encrypted information about the transaction's path through the network. Currently, it is not possible to add annotations that are readable only by specific known intermediate nodes, but it may be achievable through custom implementations. In addition, discussions are ongoing about removing the payment hash to further decorrelate hops in a payment route.Christian suggests that specific information could be given to every hop through the onion packet, allowing nodes to add annotations that can be read along the route. Benjamin points out that source routing could lead to collaborations with intermediaries where flexible communication capabilities would be required or desirable. They both praise the explicit extensibility addressed in the BOLTs, although BOLT#6 was eventually retired in favor of DNS seeds and gossiping.</summary>
