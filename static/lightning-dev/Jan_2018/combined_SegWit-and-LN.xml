    <summary>SegWit is an important component for the proper functioning of Lightning Network (LN) as it increases the block size limit, reduces transaction fees and prevents transaction malleability attacks. It is required for the funding transaction to be confirmed, after which unconfirmed commitment transactions can be created and updated safely. This was discussed in a Lightning-dev mailing list where Dr. Praveen Baratam questioned the importance of SegWit for LN, suggesting that waiting for the funding transaction to be confirmed would allow for the safe creation and updating of unconfirmed commitment transactions without requiring SegWit.However, Johan Torås Halseth responded that without SegWit, funding transactions can be malleated, leaving commitment transactions invalid and funds locked up if one party stops cooperating. Additionally, members of the community have raised concerns about the impact of SegWit on the overall scalability of the Bitcoin network. The email conversation also touches on the most mature Lightning implementation, with lnd being recommended by the author. However, they advise caution when experimenting with it on mainnet and suggest restricting oneself to testnet unless willing to lose some dust. The limitations and known-gaps in the Lightning network protocol are also acknowledged, including the use of the same hash for the entire route, which spies can correlate if the route passes through multiple different nodes they control. The Burchert-Decker-Wattenhofer channel factories are not yet part of the BOLT spec, but will reduce blockchain use further at the cost of a more involved process for closing channels. WatchTower, which would let users delegate blockchain watching to a third party, is also being developed and will be added in a future BOLT version.In conclusion, SegWit is an essential requirement for the successful implementation of LN and should be active on the mainnet before implementation.</summary>
