    <summary>The context revolves around the behavior of `open_channel.channel_flags` and `channel_update` in C-lightning. According to the discussion, a temporary `channel_update` is sent after `funding_locked` has been sent by both sides, as well as reconnection. However, it is not sent if the channel is shutting down or has already achieved the announcement depth. After that, the "normal" `channel_update` should get sent after a `channel_announcement`.Moreover, the conversation touches upon how to obtain onLightning fee rates for invoice `r` fields when creating private routes. Nayuta-ueno asked for clarification on whether c-lightning checks the 'r' field from payee's invoice. ZmnSCPxj explained that the invoice has a signature for the entire invoice, but only the payee's signature is included in the channel fee.ZmnSCPxj further added that the payee has an incentive to provide accurate channel information since incorrect information could lead to payment failure. Thus, only the payee's signature should suffice, and if they provide bad information, they risk not getting paid.Lastly, ZmnSCPxj also provided information about the Ptarmigan Lightning Network project by Nayuta Ueno/Nayutaco. The project, which can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/nayutaco/ptarmigan, is associated with the daemon ucoind and the CLI ucoincli.</summary>
