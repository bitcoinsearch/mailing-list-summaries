    <summary>The Lightning Network has implemented asymmetric delays in commitment transactions to prevent denial-of-service (DOS) attacks. However, the effectiveness of this strategy has been questioned as attackers can still unbalance the channel in their favor and refuse to participate in a mutual close, forcing an on-chain closure. Symmetrical delay commitment transactions could create cheaper disruptions, but they are more passive than the attacks possible under a symmetrical delay commitment transaction scheme. ZmnSCPxj discusses two attack scenarios in symmetric and asymmetric delays. In a symmetric delay scenario, he can use either passive or active attacks to force most funds into the other side, resulting in lockups for both parties. In an asymmetric delay scenario, he can only use a passive attack to force most funds into the other side, resulting in lockup for the other party only.The writer argues that adding a new attack vector to mitigate another attack vector is not a good trade-off as it creates a new attack that is easier to perform than the current attack. They suggest setting the delay as min(to_remote_delay, to_local_delay * to_local_value / to_remote_value) to ensure that the punishment delivered is no greater than the time-value lost by the initiator of the unilateral close.Jim Posen suggests implementing a symmetric CSV delay to shift the game from chicken to a tragedy of the commons and incentivize mutual close. However, this change could also create a DOS vector. The suggestion is to add a new section called "Symmetric CSV Delay" to the brainstorming part of the wiki.ZmnSCPxj proposes a channel setup where he funds a 1BTC channel with Daniel. To make the symmetry equal on both sides of the commitment transaction, he sends 0.99BTC to Daniel for 0.99BTC worth of Daniel products. He then publishes his original revoked commitment transaction without any delay and gets 1.0BTC and 0.99BTC worth of Daniel products immediately. However, an attacker could still perform a costless attack in the situation where funding a new channel is required.The discussion revolves around the potential for DOS attacks on the Lightning Network and the use of symmetric or asymmetric delays in commitment transactions as a mitigation strategy. The suggestion of adding a new attack vector to mitigate another attack vector is debated, and different proposals are made to incentivize mutual close while preventing DOS attacks.</summary>
