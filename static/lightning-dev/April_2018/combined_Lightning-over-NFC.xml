    <summary>Igor Cota, a Lightning developer, is experimenting with payments via NFC using c-lightning on Android. He envisions a system that is instantaneous like contactless bank cards and encodes a fancy HTML receipt in bolt11 for future reference. Two basic ways to use NFC-enabled phones are passive tag readers and card emulation mode. Card emulation mode enables two-way communication and an ad hoc connection to the lightning network, while passive tags work only if both the phone and terminal are connected to the network and have a route to each other. After some handshaking, the phone can tell the terminal that it wants to connect to lightning via NFC. All communication between these two lightning nodes can be done over NFC or even Bluetooth. A MIME type (application/lightning) and an NFC application ID (LIGHTNING) were selected along with a simple protocol to forward socket data. However, ZmnSCPxj raised concerns about censorship and direct payment channels. Communication over a secure channel to a trusted server is preferred for practical mobile devices, but initiating a payment requires direct communication with whoever you have a direct channel to. The trusted server can be a full Lightning node running at the payer's home. Standards should be agreed upon for interoperability, but it is unclear how to proceed with this.</summary>
