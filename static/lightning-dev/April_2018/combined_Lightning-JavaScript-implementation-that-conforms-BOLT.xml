    <summary>Aleksey Bykhun is seeking advice on how to run a Lightning Network node within a browser, and is considering implementing the BOLT protocol in JS or compiling the c-lightning project under WebAssembly. However, this could pose an obstacle as c-lightning depends on the bitcoin-cli binary for bitcoind RPC, and there are certain functions such as sockets that may prevent it from compiling easily. Tyler suggests a better approach would be to write a browser extension that interfaces with a daemon already running on the system through REST or similar. Igor notes that Aleksey's biggest obstacle is probably the fact that c-lightning spawns several processes, but if WebAssembly supports multiple processes, that could be a good start. Tyler suggests using Lightning Charge for c-lightning, or lnd has REST and gRPC built-in. Aleksey could even bundle the daemon with the browser in a neat package like the Tor Browser Bundle. The writer asks what to look for when trying to run this and requests general feedback on the idea. A c-lightning specific mailing list is available for further information.</summary>
