    <summary>The Lightning-dev mailing list has discussed using Bech32 encoding in QR codes for Lightning Network nodes. Robert Olsson initiated the conversation and suggested a format, lightning:ln1bech32nodeid/ipnumber/port, to keep QR codes small. This would avoid confusion with characters like "@" and ":" in IPv6 addresses and port numbers. Igor Cota responded by stating that not using hex would save 33 bytes and he intends to support both approaches. The discussion also brings up the idea of using Bech32 encoding for IP addresses and port numbers as another potential approach.Bech32 is designed to make small QR codes because it can create text-mode QR-codes which are much smaller. Invoices are pure Bech32 and satisfy requirements for small QR codes. The forum suggests that standardizing QR code formats for Lightning Network nodes could improve their usability. It might be best to have the UX ask the user if they want to open a new channel directly to the store or to a randomly selected goat farmer on the other side of the world that might have a well-funded path - this could be optional. Rusty Russell anticipates a move away from "manually connect to node" and this wart will be less visible. A Bech32 'ln1' encoding could be created, but it would be 62 chars vs. 66. Despite some differing opinions, there appears to be interest in standardizing QR code formats for Lightning Network nodes to improve their usability.</summary>
