    <summary>Aaron van Wirdum is writing an extensive article on the history of the Lightning Network and is seeking information about Amiko Pay, a predecessor to the network. He found some older documents but hopes that Corné Plooy can provide additional insight into how similar Amiko Pay was to the concept described in the Lightning Network white paper and how it compared to Ripple. He's also looking for any other old proposals, concepts or ideas that played a role in the history of Lightning and/or Amiko Pay. On 3rd April 2018, Aaron sent an email to Corné on the Lightning-dev list requesting for information about Amiko Pay. In his email, he asked Corné if Amiko Pay resembled the concept described in the Lightning Network white paper and also requested information about its similarities and differences with Ripple. The deadline for this article was the next day, and although most of the article was finished, there were still some gaps that needed to be filled, such as the Amiko Pay part. Aaron hoped to receive a response from Corné soon and could be contacted on IRC.</summary>
