    <summary>The email conversation between Conner and ZmnSCPxj is focused on the WatchTower protocol used in lnd. They discuss ways to optimize the set of signatures sent to the watchtower, including sending only the latest items in the script template and signatures for the various breach outputs instead of the entire justice transaction. They also discuss potential issues with the confirmation of second-level HTLC transactions and the need to separate the commitment outpoints from the HTLC outpoints.ZmnSCPxj proposes a minimal solution involving signatures for independent sweep transactions, allowing the watchtower to sweep each HTLC output individually to prevent attackers from moving funds from the channel into their wallet. The encrypted blob approach for watchtowers is also discussed, which involves sending an encrypted blob with a hint to the watchtower that can be decrypted to assemble a justice transaction.To prevent attackers from exploiting the network, changes in lightning network code are needed, including detecting spent commitment outputs and second-level transactions and forgoing the sweeping of already spent second-level transactions. A new BOLT document may be created to formalize the approach, but implementation details still need to be addressed.The proposed changes are seen as a reasonable compromise between the tradeoffs at hand and the potential for future improvements. Nicolas Dorier has requested additional hooks in c-lightning for a simple WatchTower system, but there are concerns about the current interface requiring a trusted WatchTower, which could lead to the loss of channel funds. Finally, the idea of simplifying the construction of WatchTowers by creating one-blob-one-justice pairs for each outpoint of the revoked commitment transaction is suggested.</summary>
