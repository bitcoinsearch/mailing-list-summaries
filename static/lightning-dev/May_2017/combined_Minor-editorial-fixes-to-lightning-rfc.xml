    <summary>A developer has submitted minor editorial patches to the lightning-rfc via email, with three attachments. Rusty Russell, on behalf of the Lightning Network team, thanked the developer for the patches but suggested that it would be better to submit them as GitHub pull requests to avoid spamming the mailing list. Russell also noted that the list is generally used for discussing large change proposals, though even these are better if they start with a GitHub patch.The developer's email contained three patches: one for 02-peer-protocol.md, one for 07-routing-gossip.md (moving a text about ipv6 and port from channel_update to node_announcement), and another for 07-routing-gossip.md (updating text about end indication). All patches were applied and can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/161.ZmnSCPxj responded to the email thanking the developer for contribution. They mentioned that submitting minor fixes as pull requests on GitHub would be better to avoid spamming the mailing list, but they are happy to accept personal submissions if necessary. ZmnSCPxj also notes that the mailing list is generally used for discussing large change proposals, which should ideally start with a GitHub patch. The conversation ends with ZmnSCPxj expressing understanding and signing off.</summary>
