    <summary>Neil Fincham has asked if there is a way to generate H, the payment hash in Lightning Network (LN), deterministically without revealing S, the payment preimage used to close a channel. In their email, they point out that Bitcoin addresses can be generated using BIP32 without private keys and ask if the same can be done with H. Rusty responds, stating that it is possible but not with the current method, clarifying that "payment hash" refers to H and "payment preimage" to S. He further explains that S is still required to close out the HTLC, but payment requests could be sent out without access to the preimages.Rusty suggests using a pubkey for the payment hash and a privkey for the payment preimage, which would allow for the use of BIP32. However, he notes that this cannot be done with SHA256. Additionally, he mentions a scheme using Schnorr where the signature itself serves as a kind of preimage, allowing for a similar partition scheme to what Neil described. Nonetheless, Rusty is unsure about this scheme's feasibility.In summary, Neil has inquired about generating H deterministically while keeping S hidden, and Rusty responded by suggesting the use of pubkeys and privkeys, but not with SHA256. He also mentioned a potential scheme using Schnorr, but its feasibility remains uncertain.</summary>
