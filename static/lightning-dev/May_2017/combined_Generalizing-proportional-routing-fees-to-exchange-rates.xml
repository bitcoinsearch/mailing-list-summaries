    <summary>ZmnSCPxj has proposed modifying the Lightning Network protocol to change advertising of proportional routing fees to BTC-to-BTC exchange rates. Currently, nodes advertise supported coins via the hashes of their genesis blocks and an exchange rate denominated in ratio of 1/1,000,000 can be encoded in four bytes. To advertise exchange rates, a node provides 64 bytes to identify the coins being referred to and four bytes for the actual exchange rate. For cross-chain exchange rates, a node needs to advertise both directions. One way to advertise would be to advertise a BTC-to-LTC exchange rate plus a rate offset. The Lightning Network developers have discussed the issues of cross-chain payments and random currencies. They agreed that cross-chain transactions are complex and bring in a lot of complexity to an already complex system. The edge of the network refers to either the node performing the exchange or the endpoint creating the route. These are the only ones who need to concern themselves with the problems that come from this being a cross-chain transfer. There may be some added noise for other nodes when it comes to being able to prove things along routes. The developers suggested that it is far more efficient to have them communicate out of band by creating an order book on top of the base network and do order matching in there, rather than attempting to fit this added complexity into LN itself. They also discussed the issue of random currencies on Lightning, saying that it is not clear why you would want them once Bitcoin has Lightning. If free channels were created, many DoS deterrents require Bitcoin-like on-chain fees to work at all, thus punting the risk onto the nodes straddling the chains. However, how attractive would their service be if they need to charge high fees to absorb that risk? The developers emphasized that they are currently focusing on slowing down the evolution of the 1.0 spec, so that they can finalize their implementations and start integration testing. If approved, network users will have to compute the exchange rate to determine the amount they need to send. The future of cross-chain payments and random currencies on Lightning remains uncertain as the developers continue to focus on finalizing their existing implementations.</summary>
