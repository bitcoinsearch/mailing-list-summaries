    <summary>A proposal by ZmnSCPxj suggests that the Lightning Network protocol may be modified to change the advertising of proportional routing fees to BTC-to-BTC exchange rates. Currently, nodes advertise supported coins via the hashes of their genesis blocks and a ratio of 1/1,000,000 can be encoded in four bytes. To advertise exchange rates, a node provides 64 bytes to identify the coins being referred to and four bytes for the actual exchange rate. For cross-chain exchange rates, a node needs to advertise both directions. If approved, network users will have to compute the exchange rate to determine the amount they need to send.The Lightning Network developers discussed the issues surrounding cross-chain payments and random currencies. They agreed that cross-chain transactions are complex and bring a lot of complexity to an already complex system. The edge of the network refers to either the node performing the exchange or the endpoint creating the route. These are the only ones who need to concern themselves with the problems of cross-chain transfers. Creating an order book on top of the base network and doing order matching there would be far more efficient than attempting to fit this added complexity into LN itself. The developers also discussed the issue of random currencies on Lightning, saying that it is not clear why someone would want them once Bitcoin has Lightning. If free channels were created, many DoS deterrents require Bitcoin-like on-chain fees to work at all, thus punting the risk onto the nodes straddling the chains. However, how attractive would their service be if they need to charge high fees to absorb that risk? The developers emphasized that they are currently focusing on slowing down the evolution of the 1.0 spec to finalize their implementations and start integration testing.</summary>
