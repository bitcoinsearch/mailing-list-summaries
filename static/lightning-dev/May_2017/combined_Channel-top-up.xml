    <summary>The Lightning Network protocol has been the subject of several proposals and discussions regarding the top-up problem. One proposed solution is to use onion routing for cross-currency exchange without having to initiate a channel on the LTC side. This involves using the top-up procedure as the first hop of an onion route for someone off-LN to pay into an LN node without committing funds to open a channel.However, there are concerns about bad actors on the Lightning Network, such as potential hostage situations when closing a channel and reopening a new one from the settlement. Christian Decker proposed splice-in/-out as a solution to topping up the funds in a channel, which involves creating a new 2-of-2 output and letting it confirm before asking the counterparty to collaborate in closing the channel.Another proposal by ZmnSCPxj involved a new operation called "re-anchoring" that would allow adding or removing funds from the channel by mutual cooperation. The combination of on-chain and off-chain payments through onion routes is seen as a great feature with various potential applications, such as initiating Litecoin connections to Litecoin LN nodes directly without going through an exchange each time.Treating on-chain payments like any other lightning channel transfer was also discussed, which allows treating on-chain payments identically to off-chain payments. The discussion also covers why channel opens require the initiator to put up funding for the channel, which is simpler and requires very little coordination. At the latest when the channel is being funded, you'd see that information anyway.Overall, the use of onion routes with on-chain and off-chain hops for exchanges simplifies the process and treats on-chain payments similarly to off-chain payments while ensuring everyone's protection.</summary>
