    <summary>The Lightning Network, which is a protocol for off-chain bitcoin payments, may be more vulnerable to probing attacks than other payment channels. To address this issue, the developers have devised a solution that uses XORing to make it harder to probe the network and turn the lightning node into a gambling casino. The Lightning Network also needs to consider other use-cases beyond invoice-based transfers, such as donations without prior contact between the sender and receiver. To enable these types of transfers, the recipient needs the payment preimage to clear the hash time-locked contract (HTLC), and there must be a mechanism signaling the sender's identity without out-of-band communication. Christian Decker proposed two possible solutions for this issue. One option involves adding new information into the routing info, while the other involves creating a circular route where the payment is masqueraded as an oversized fee deposited at the recipient.Another suggestion by ZmnSCPxj is to create a gambling service where the payout of the winning amount is the second half of the route if Alice wins at all. This method is clever and even the receiver cannot leak information on the donors. Rusty Russell and Christian Decker discussed various ideas for anti-probing, including using a prefix lookup in their routing table and deriving the payment preimage from that. They also discussed implementing the LightningDice service, which would allow probabilistic payments via the LD server.Overall, the Lightning Network developers are working on solutions to address security concerns and expand the use-cases for the network. The brainstorming ideas for these solutions will be documented on the lightning-rfc wiki on Github for future reference and formulation as BOLTs.</summary>
