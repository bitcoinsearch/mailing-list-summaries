    <summary>The Lightning Network community is actively working towards mitigating channel jamming and is experimenting with various schemes and reputation algorithms to achieve this goal. The proposed two-part scheme involves HTLC endorsement and reputation. However, the endorsement scheme still suffers from vulnerabilities, making it essential to establish reputational transitivity between incoming and outgoing traffic. The lack of transitivity of the reputation acquisition cost between hops in a payment path creates a vulnerability issue for the endorsement scheme.Local-only reputation-based systems are also being discussed, and nodes track their history with all HTLCs a peer has forwarded to them, not whether they come from repeat senders. The group is planning to gather data on the use of HTLC endorsement and local reputation tracking for jamming mitigation during their weekly calls. They suggest starting simple with a binary endorsement field and observing the effect of endorsement in the steady state with logging-only implementation.The email discusses the importance of differentiating between fees charged by a node and their reputation revenue in the HTLC endorsement model. Carla provides updates on channel jamming, including next call details and data gathering efforts. Antoine Riard suggests that building data gathering infrastructure for Lightning is valuable as any jamming mitigation will have to adapt its upfront fees or reputation acquisition cost based on market forces.The Lightning Network's HTLC endorsement scheme is vulnerable due to the lack of transitivity of the reputation acquisition cost between payment path hops. However, the community is proposing a reputation scheme to mitigate channel jamming attacks by tracking local reputation for each node's peers. Nodes track their history with all HTLCs a peer has forwarded to them, and good reputation is slow and expensive to build but fast to degrade, so sudden changes in behavior are short-lived.The community plans to gather data on repeat interactions nodes get from individual senders to determine how much use can be made of local-only reputation-based systems. Data gathering is also valuable for future simulation work and experimentation with different algorithms for tracking local reputation. Reputation schemes are not protocol/P2P gossiping issues or a "core" of a Lightning node issue, but rather a separate API or plugin.The Lightning Network community is proposing a reputation scheme to mitigate channel jamming attacks. Reputation will be tracked locally for each of a nodeâ€™s peers, with no gossip component involved. Nodes will track local reputation for their direct peers based on their history with all HTLCs a peer has forwarded to them. The reputation is slow and expensive to build and fast to degrade, so sudden changes in behavior are short-lived.In terms of reputation schemes for mitigating channel jamming, the proposal is for each node to locally track the reputation of its direct neighbors and allocate slots and liquidity based on their risk tolerance. Endorsed HTLCs from high reputation peers will be given priority, while unknown HTLCs will only be forwarded if there are slots and liquidity available. Reputation and endorsement form the first step in a two-part scheme for mitigating channel jamming, with unconditional fees for quick jams being the second step.The conversation also revolves around the topic of local-only reputation based systems. The speaker is interested in knowing how many repeat interactions nodes get from individual senders, as it helps in understanding the use of these systems. Additionally, there is an observation on the effect of dynamic reputation windows on payment reliability. Sudden changes in link throughput based on HTLC resolution might break the historical liquidity buckets of routing scoring algorithms, which could affect payment reliability.The Lightning-dev mailing list provides a forum for developers and enthusiasts to share their ideas and collaborate on projects related to Lightning. The discussion on the mailing list is about whether reputation systems can provide security guarantees or just probabilistic judgments about future behavior. While reputation data can be better than nothing, it is susceptible to sudden behavioral changes and whitewashing attacks, making it unreliable for providing guarantees.Overall, the Lightning Network community plans to gather data about the use of HTLC endorsement and local reputation tracking for jamming mitigation. They want to observe the effect of endorsement in the steady state with logging-only implementation, gather real-world data for use in future simulation work, and experiment with different algorithms for tracking local reputation. The Lightning-dev mailing list is an important resource for those involved in the development and implementation of Lightning technology.</summary>
