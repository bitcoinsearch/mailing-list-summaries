    <summary>Alex Evanovic asked for suggestions on how to measure the current state of lightning nodes in the Lightning-dev mailing list. Christian, another member of the group, responded by suggesting various aspects that one can measure, such as network topology, monitoring a single node, or the success rate of payments made on the network. Measuring lightning nodes is essential for understanding the performance of the network and identifying areas that need improvement. Swayam expressed interest in measuring the network topology of the lightning network, and Davison suggested looking up information on explorer sites like 1ml.org. Robert Olsson, a Lightning Network developer, has provided a way to access raw graph data from one of his nodes through https://rompert.com/networkgraph.To measure the performance of lightning nodes accurately requires a combination of tools, analysis techniques, and expertise in the lightning network protocol. One can use Lightning Labs' LND Dashboard and Node Launcher or third-party solutions such as RTL and ThunderHub. Analyzing the network traffic and node behavior using packet sniffing or other network analysis techniques can provide insights into the data transmitted between nodes and help identify bottlenecks or other network issues impacting performance.To measure the number of nodes and channels in the Lightning Network, one can connect to any LN node and set the initial_routing_sync flag in the init message. Listnodes and listchannels commands with lightning-cli can also be used to query c-lightning nodes. Alternatively, explorer sites like 1ml.com can provide this information without running a node or performing any actions.In conclusion, measuring lightning nodes requires a deep understanding of the network architecture and the tools available for monitoring it. Members of the Lightning-dev mailing list can provide valuable insights and suggestions for those interested in measuring lightning nodes, and there are several ways to measure the number of nodes and channels in the network.</summary>
