    <summary>Robert Olsson has proposed a new feature for the Lightning Network called "Free Rebalancing Proposals". The proposal involves sending a message over a channel A, and the max amount you would propose to balance in that direction. Each node analyses the in and out channels and adjusts the max to its own desire to balance. If everyone is happy with the proposed rebalancing, the origin node sends a payment along this node without dropping off any fees along the way since all nodes agreed and benefit from the rebalancing act.Rebalancing helps to solve problems by increasing redundancy and maximum possible routes. However, ZmnSCPxj argues that rebalancing is not a good solution, and suggests using off-to-on and on-to-off swapping instead. This involves swapping offchain funds for onchain funds and can be done on a separate layer or software that interacts with ordinary existing LN software without requiring additional changes at the LN protocol level.In the conversation between Robert and ZmnSCPxj, ZmnSCPxj proposes the idea of using normal onion-routing modified in some way to read and modify max for rebalancing. Robert questions the state before and after of channel D-C and postulates that in any case where rebalancing is possible, then a payment route exists that is sufficient for payment to the network, and in the end, the purpose of LN is payment, not some ideal of channel balance. He suggests that dynamic fee changing is sufficient and requires no update to the base LN protocol.</summary>
