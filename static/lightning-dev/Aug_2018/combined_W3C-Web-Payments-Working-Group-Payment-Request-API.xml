    <summary>The W3C Web Payments Working Group is currently discussing the compatibility of Bitcoin and Lightning with the proposed Payment Request API. Christian Decker, a member of the working group, has commented that the spec should be compatible with both cryptocurrencies, but suggests the need for a special Payment Method ID to be assigned to Bitcoin and Lightning since they cannot rely on a centralized URL. A local handler can also be specified as a Payment Handler, allowing for a Bitcoin or Lightning daemon running locally that is invoked for payment requests.Christian Decker is following the discussion to determine what changes and special considerations are needed for Bitcoin and Lightning to work correctly when the spec is finalized and deployed. The Payment Request API even mentions XBT as a supported currency in addition to ISO4217 codes. Special handling is required for Bitcoin and Lightning with regard to the Payment Method, therefore, the Payment Method Manifest doesn't apply to them. This suggests that Bitcoin and Lightning should work with the spec without any major roadblocks. The W3C Web Payments Working Group is looking for feedback on their GitHub repository. A member of the Lightning-dev community has asked if any companies are members of W3C and if anyone could be a member of the W3C Web Payments Working Group. Christian Decker is mentioned as being a member in a previous email, which the community member finds awesome. The W3C has released their candidate recommendation for a payment API, which will be published no earlier than October 31st 2018. They are currently looking for feedback on their GitHub repository. It would be even cooler if lightning payments were compatible with the W3C's recommendation. The community member asks Christian for an update on the work and how relevant it is for them. As there are multiple ways to go about proposing a payment method, the discussion is ongoing and progress is being tracked on the working group's Github page.</summary>
