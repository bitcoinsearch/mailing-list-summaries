    <summary>Kulpreet Singh, a researcher interested in the Lightning Network (LN) graph, shared his early results on measuring node centrality and dependence on some nodes to route payments and prevent network partitions. He measured the centrality of nodes and central point dominance using methods from two well-known papers. Singh suggests that this is just a start and that they should look at treating LN as a directed graph and perform analysis based on treating LN as a flow network. René Pickhardt responded with a message thanking Singh for sharing his work and providing links to his own work on c-lightning autopilot and heuristics for selecting nodes to which one could connect. In an email exchange between Elias Rohrer and Kulpreet Singh, they discussed several aspects related to the LN graph. They talked about the significant challenge of message complexity and replacing the current source routing scheme's route selection algorithm with a flow-based approach. Furthermore, Kulpreet had written to Rene Pickhardt about measuring the centrality of various nodes in the LN graph and the dependence on some nodes to route payments and prevent network partitions. Overall, these researchers are looking at ways to measure and track changes in key metrics in the LN graph to assist the community in deciding which nodes to open new channels with.</summary>
