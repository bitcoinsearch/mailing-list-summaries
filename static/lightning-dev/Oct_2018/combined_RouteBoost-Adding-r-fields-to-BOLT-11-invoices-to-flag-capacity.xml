    <summary>The c-lightning program recently implemented a new feature that adds an 'r' field to channels with enough incoming capacity for a specific amount. This feature can be useful in payment routing and establishing initial channels. However, the r= information is not yet used by c-lightning, but other implementations should start using it.In discussions about leaking available bandwidth information through new routing hints, Olaoluwa Osuntokun suggested that dropping packets is the only recourse against an individual attempting to probe the node. Pierre argued that there is no reason to believe that invoicers have more knowledge than the receiver except for the last hop. However, another person disagreed and believed that receivers have more accurate information compared to payers who are mostly mobile wallets with less reliable data.Rusty Russell agreed with this and added that if the payer knows its information is less reliable, it should prefer the provided route. The discussion suggests that care must be taken to consider incentives and the reliability of information when choosing routes for Lightning payments.Johan warned against always trying to use r-fields to populate public channels, as this may result in high fees. Rusty Russell agreed that receivers are likely to have more knowledge of the network than payers and that the payer should prefer the provided route if they know their information is less reliable.Matt Corallo proposed using invoice-r=-provided-hints over publicly-discovered routes but using other last-hops in case a substantially better route is known. The writer argues that the receiver may have a full and up-to-date view of the network, making it logical for receivers to assist senders once incentives are aligned.Overall, the discussions highlight the need to consider the reliability of information and incentives when choosing routes for Lightning payments. The proposal for the 'r' field change in c-lightning was met with positive feedback from the community, and Rusty Russell welcomes further thoughts and feedback on the matter.</summary>
