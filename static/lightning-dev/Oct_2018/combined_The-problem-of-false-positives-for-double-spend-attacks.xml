    <summary>Margherita Favaretto, a Master's student of Cyber Security at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), is conducting research on Lightning Network double-spend attacks in San Francisco for a month. She proposed a "trusted remediation" gossip protocol to mitigate false positives such as software errors and malicious nodes, and requested open feedback and collaboration opportunities with interested individuals. However, Alejandro Ranchal Pedrosa responded that there are no possible double-spend attacks on the Lightning Network, causing Margherita to study Eltoo as a potential solution to the issue. She aims to keep the remediation within the Lightning network to avoid additional time and cost of an on-chain transaction. Margherita seeks help to focus her research on the right issues and to open a discussion about her assumptions and related work that could help her. The goal is to give her contribution to this project and be actively part of the group as an independent researcher.</summary>
