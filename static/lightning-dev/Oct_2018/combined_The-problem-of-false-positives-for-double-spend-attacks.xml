    <summary>Margherita Favaretto, a Master's student of Cyber Security at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), is working on a research project focused on a remediation protocol for double-spend attacks in the Lightning Network. She is seeking feedback from the Lightning-dev group and wants to mitigate false positives. Favaretto aims to distinguish between software bugs and malicious nodes that should be excluded from the network. She proposed a "trusted remediation" gossip protocol to identify false positives, communicate them to other nodes, and initiate the remediation payments mechanism. Alejandro Ranchal Pedrosa responded to her email with some feedback and suggested focusing on other things like an atomic multipath protocol that supports contingent payment (pay for secret) protocol or trustless watchtowers. Furthermore, if the problem is the inadvertent publication of revoked commitment transactions, the correct solution is not to have revocable transactions in the first place, i.e. eltoo. Although it may take time for needed features of eltoo to appear on the blockchain layer, it would still take time to implement "trusted remediation". The use of "trusted" in the term "trusted remediation" is also seen as a severe negative and unlikely to be accepted.</summary>
