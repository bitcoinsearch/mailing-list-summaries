    <summary>ZmnSCPxj and Fabrice discussed the possibility of reducing synchronization problems in Lightning Network by using set reconciliation algorithms. They suggested considering timestamp and enable/disable state of channel updates as part of an item, which could be dropped except for the one with the latest timestamp. Fabrice proposed an extension to the current "channel queries" for nodes to sync their outdated channel updates properly. In response, ZmnSCPxj suggested a solution to the set reconciliation problem by dropping all items except the one with the latest timestamp. Fabrice opened an issue on the RFC's Github repo and posted on the forum to have a less constrained discussion. Lightning Network is a p2p network of nodes where nodes are vertices and channels are edges, and payments can be made to any node with a route. The routing table includes static information such as channel announcements and dynamic information such as channel updates. Routing sync is crucial for LN wallets, but offline nodes cannot sync their channel updates correctly, leading to outdated information. Fabrice proposes a timestamp-based channel update sync scheme to extend query parameters to include channel update timestamps. This scheme has been tested on a mobile wallet with positive results.</summary>
