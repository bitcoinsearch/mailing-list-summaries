    <summary>The Lightning Network faces scalability issues as every node in the network must be aware of every other node to choose a complete route for transactions. The potential for 7e10 nodes in a fully connected graph would require at least 35TB of data storage for each node, making it unfeasible. A solution proposed by the author is to have peers keep track of only nearby nodes and use a routing table for more distant nodes. A DHT could be used as an example where no intermediate node knows both the sender and receiver. However, this system design is challenging but possible. Christian suggests that they are already considering more advanced path-finding algorithms to reduce the need for complete information on the node. Rusty had some calculations about the raw size of the data that a node has to handle for 1 million nodes, which comes to about 120 MB without updates. Overall, the routing problem is considered a luxury problem since there are many aspects to implement generally for Lightning before hitting that wall.</summary>
