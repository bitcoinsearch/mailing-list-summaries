    <summary>The Lightning Network protocol allows nodes to be behind Tor hidden services, which automatically have NAT punching and firewall traversal as long as the firewall allows the Tor protocol to go through. There are no UIs available for discovering nodes currently running on the network, but current Lightning Network programs keep track of this information in their databases, although each one varies in detail. The network bootstrap involves some Lightning Network nodes being discoverable via DNS, then your node will connect to them, request node gossip, then it will select from the node information it acquires to select some nodes to connect and channel to.Incoming channel requests are auto-accepted with no UI available to accept or reject them, but users can choose to reject some nodes via any heuristic they choose. Each node indicates a "fixed fee" and a "proportional fee," with the "fixed fee" imposed per successful routing attempt, while the "proportional fee" is a ratio of the value traveling through the node when it is on the route. It is expected that there will be many nodes through which people can route, so there will be much competition, and eventually, the system will settle to a state where most nodes charge the same low fee.There is no performance/reputation info available for any hub, but your auto-channeling program will gather statistics and other information to make some guesses on which nodes have good performance. It should be noted that there is nothing that specially privileges hubs, and any node can become a hub without permission or special treatment of the network, if by "hub" we mean "node with high number of channels". Even the DNS bootstrap should only be used to gather initial node gossip to acquire some other nodes that can potentially be channeled to.To discover nodes and see which ones are currently running on the network, there is a UI available for users. If someone wants to become a hub and earn routing fees, it is beneficial to channel with relatively new and low-connectivity nodes. Routing fees are based on a percentage of transactions, and the amount earned can vary between hubs. Channels are initially single-funded, but there is a proposal for dual-funded channels that did not make it into version 1.0. It is suggested that if you have some onchain bitcoins to invest, it is in your best interest to channel with relatively new and low-connectivity nodes. This way, you could receive payments from other users and have a higher chance of being routed through.</summary>
