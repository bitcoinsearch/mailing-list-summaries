    <summary>In a Lightning-dev post, user ZmnSCPxj responds to a question about discovering nodes on the network. They state that there are no UIs available but current Lightning Network programs keep track of this information in their databases. The details of each program's tracking varies, and the individual developers likely know how to extract this information. ZmnSCPxj also shares a website they found, explorer.acinq.co, which they used to connect to a couple of nodes.The Lightning Network protocol allows nodes to be behind Tor hidden services, which automatically have NAT punching and firewall traversal as long as the firewall allows the Tor protocol to go through. It is unclear if there are already Lightning Network software that supports being run as a Tor hidden service yet.To discover nodes on the network, there are no UIs available. The current LN programs keep track of this in their databases, but they vary in detail. Network bootstrap involves some LN nodes being discoverable via DNS, then a node connects to them, request node gossip, then it will select from the node information it acquires to select some nodes to connect and channel to.There is a difference between "connect" and "channel"; to connect means only that you contact them over the network and consumes only bandwidth and some small amount of CPU power on your node, whereas to channel means to commit some bitcoins to a payment channel between you.There is no UI where one can accept or reject incoming channel requests, as one auto-accepts incoming channel requests. One may program the node to reject some nodes via any heuristic one chooses, but one would have to implement that themselves.If one intends to become a hub and earn routing fees, investing some on-chain bitcoins is suggested. Each node indicates as part of its information a "fixed fee" and a "proportional fee". It is expected that there will be many nodes through which people can route, so there will be much competition, and eventually, the system will settle to a state where most nodes charge the same low fee.There are no performance/reputation info available for any hub. Presumably, the auto-channeling program will gather statistics and other information to make some guesses on which nodes have good performance. Any node can become a hub without permission or special treatment of the network if by "hub" we mean "node with high number of channels". Even the DNS bootstrap should only be used to gather initial node gossip to acquire some *other* nodes that can potentially be channeled to.To discover nodes and see which ones are currently running on the network, there is a UI available for users. When someone wants to connect with another node, they will send channel funding messages. If someone wants to become a hub and earn routing fees, it is beneficial to channel with relatively new and low-connectivity nodes.Routing fees are based on a percentage of transactions, and the amount earned can vary between hubs. To select which hub to connect to, there is no current performance or reputation information available, but users can use their own selection criteria. Channels are initially single-funded, but there is a proposal for dual-funded channels that did not make it into version 1.0.It is suggested that if you have some on-chain bitcoins to invest, it is in your best interest to channel with relatively new and low-connectivity nodes. This way, you could receive payments from other users and have a higher chance of being routed through.When selecting nodes to peer with, users can choose their own selection criteria. lnd offers an "auto-pilot" feature that selects peers to channel with using some heuristic, while c-lightning may eventually offer a similar feature in the future. Node gossip allows users to learn of other nodes they may channel with in the future.Currently, channels are single-funded, but there is a proposal for dual-funded channel setup that did not make it into 1.0. If users have on-chain bitcoins to invest and intend to become a hub and earn routing fees, it is in their interest to channel with relatively new and low-connectivity nodes. By doing so, they increase their chances of being routed through if those nodes become prolific users of the network in the future.When someone wants to connect to a user, their node connects to the user's and sends channel funding messages.The individual who wrote this post is attempting to understand how to find a peer for their lightning connections. They are specifically interested in connecting with nodes that have 6 links, each having $100. The author poses several questions related to this topic, such as how to select nodes to peer with and how to convince them to do deposits. Ideally, the author would like their peers to match their $100 deposit, but they are unsure if this is feasible. Additionally, the author wants to know how to determine if someone wishes to connect with them.</summary>
