    <summary>Johan Torås Halseth responded to a question posed by Edziu Marynarz about setting fees for each direction of a channel. He explained that fees can be set for each direction of the channel and provided a link to the Github page for the channel_update message, which allows individual control over fees. Rusty Russell also joined the discussion, explaining that fees are charged on entry to the channel and paid by the party initiating the transaction. While it would have been preferable for both sender and recipient to set their own fees, this would complicate things. Receiving is actually more costly than sending, and users with more balance than the initial opening of the channel must monitor old states published as it is not risk-free. The writer suggested regulating imbalance with fees to mitigate risk and reduce the potential loss of opening fees if the other party simply cashes out the balance without keeping the channel open for receiving.</summary>
