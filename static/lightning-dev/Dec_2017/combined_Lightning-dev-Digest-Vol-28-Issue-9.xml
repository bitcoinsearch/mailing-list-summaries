    <summary>When joining the Lightning Network, users are responsible for selecting which nodes to connect with. However, some implementations offer an "auto-pilot" feature that selects peers based on heuristics and node gossip can also be used to discover good nodes to connect with. When opening channels, users must initially fund them alone and cannot force others to match the funds. If a user becomes a hub and earns routing fees, it is in their best interest to channel with new and low-connectivity nodes, as other aspiring hubs will want to lock spare funds to channel with them. However, if a user is only connected to other nodes and no one is connected to them, their deposit is only used by themselves, potentially negatively affecting availability for their own transactions. Therefore, it is suggested to connect but accept no incoming connections. Stan Kladko suggests that if there is a reason to open channels to arbitrary nodes, other nodes may have a reason to open channels with you as well. Rusty disagrees with this strategy and believes that routing through your node does not affect total capacity if there are two channels, just shifts them between the channels. There is no UI to see nodes currently running on the network, but nodes will connect and send channel funding messages. It is unclear if there is a UI to accept or reject these connections. It is also uncertain how much can be earned in routing fees or if all hubs earn the same fees. Additionally, it is not clear how to select which hub to connect to if many are available, nor is there any performance or reputation information available for any hub.</summary>
