    <summary>When joining the Lightning Network, users must select which nodes to peer with. Some implementations have an "auto-pilot" feature that selects peers based on certain heuristics and it's possible to learn of other nodes through node gossip. When opening channels, they are initially single-funded and there is no way to force someone else to match the funds. However, if a user becomes a hub and earns routing fees, it's in their interest to channel with relatively new and low-connectivity nodes. If a user is connected to some nodes but no one is connected to them, their deposit is only used by them which can negatively affect availability for their own transactions. It's suggested to connect but accept no incoming connections to avoid this issue. There is no UI to see nodes currently running on the network, but nodes will connect and send funding messages. It's unclear if there is a UI to accept or reject these connections.It's not clear how much a user can earn from routing fees or if they are the same for all hubs. If a user sees many hubs when connecting to the network, it's not clear how to select which to connect to or if there is any performance/reputation information available. In a discussion on opening channels to arbitrary nodes, Stan Kladko suggests that if a user has a reason to do so, other nodes may also have a reason to open channels with them. However, routing nodes through a user's node could potentially negatively affect the availability of their deposit for their own transactions. Rusty disagrees with this strategy and believes that routing through a user's node doesn't affect their total capacity if they have two channels. It just shifts them between the channels.</summary>
