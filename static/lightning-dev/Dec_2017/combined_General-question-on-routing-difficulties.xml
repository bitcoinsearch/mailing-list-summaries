    <summary>PhD students at Purdue and the University of Waterloo have developed a novel routing algorithm called SpeedyMurmurs suitable for decentralized payment networks such as lightning network (LN). The approach uses an embedding-based methodology, where algorithms assign meaningful coordinates to nodes that enable efficient and effective discovery of payment paths. They have simulated several configurations of SpeedyMurmurs using real data from the Ripple network and compared it with other routing algorithms available in the literature.In an email exchange, Pedro raises some questions and comments regarding the Lightning Network (LN) implementation, specifically related to routing mechanisms. Christian responds by discussing how the current LN implementation requires nodes to compute the entire route for payments but that there are mechanisms in place for endpoints to collaboratively find a route. He also mentions that they plan to add landmarks for routing in the long-term. Pedro expresses interest in collaborating on landmark-based routing and Christian agrees that he would like to separate the base routing layer from the onion routing layer eventually.The author discusses a paper about coordinate embedding that can provide sender and receiver privacy in a payment network using a distance-vector-like routing system. The author believes that this protocol is better suited for closed-membership networks such as Ripple, which has only a handful of gateways. Ripple does not have a concept of fees within the network and relies on bi-lateral trust. In comparison, Lightning Network (LN) operates differently. In an email sent to a mailing list, Olaoluwa Osuntokun announced that he had increased the limit to 80k. It appears that this email is a resend, as the original may not have gone through to the list. The content of the email is brief and does not provide any additional context or information. Overall, the conversation focuses on various technical aspects of the LN implementation and potential solutions to improve its efficiency and privacy. The author believes that there will not be a one-size-fits-all solution and instead suggest deploying several distinct protocols based on use-case requirements.The Lightning Network team is actively working on finding better solutions to the problem of finding routes across a vast network of nodes, with one option being distance vector routing such as BGP. The current protocol is a minimally viable routing protocol, but can easily be upgraded to another protocol in the future. There are concerns about the potential centralization of the network, but Christian Decker argues that hubs are unlikely to form due to the high cost and fees associated with them, and there are mechanisms in place for off-chain channel rebalancing and fund reallocation. Additionally, the Lightning Network's transaction fees will only be required for channel setup and tear down, reducing fees. Collaborative routing in the Lightning Network is done through routing hints in payment requests, and Olaoluwa Osuntokun confirmed this mechanism.A new routing algorithm called SpeedyMurmurs has been developed for decentralized payment networks, which uses an embedding-based approach to assign meaningful coordinates to nodes that enable efficient and effective discovery of payment paths. However, there are challenges associated with routing within the Lightning Network, including fragility if most of the landmarks go down and unbalanced channels. Automations are being built to take care of improving the network topology, encouraging participants to open channels that support the network as a whole, not just themselves.In addition, researchers from Purdue University have developed a routing algorithm for payment channel-based networks that lends better to closed-membership, credit networks like Ripple. Plans are underway to achieve proper sender/receiver privacy by extending Sphinx usage to leverage HORNET. The conversation is about cryptographic conservatism and routing. Distance vector routing may be one option to consider. Benjamin Mord suggests creating an inventory of unproven mathematical assumptions and/or cryptographic primitives cataloged in terms of cryptocurrency technologies which require them. He also proposes that the ideal end state would be to only assume existence of a preimage-resistant hash function, and to code such that one function could be quickly swapped with another to update entire systems. Regarding off-chain channel rebalancing and fund reallocation based solely on Bitcoin, Conrad and Christian published a similar technique [3]. They address concerns about hubs forming and centralization risk in the Lightning Network, stating that creating such a hub is extremely costly and opens up an opportunity for nodes to open bypasses. Ultimately, this should encourage participants to improve the network topology.</summary>
