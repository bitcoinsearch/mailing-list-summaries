    <summary>The Lightning Network payment protocol currently does not provide a technique for transferring funds between channels, but an alternative "pay yourself" method can be used to rebalance channels. The author proposed a "refill method" as another solution, where they can refill their exhausted channels by paying themselves via a common channel. This would allow them to pay the base fee once instead of multiple times for each micro-transaction, potentially saving them a few dollars. The proposed method involves sending a payment from channel A to channel C, who then sends it to channel B and back to channel A, effectively refilling channel A. While this method may not be as efficient as splice-in, which requires new specs and node software, it is a viable solution for rebalancing channels. The author suggests adding a "refill" button in the UI near a channel name to make the process more user-friendly. They also inquire if this method is the same as using the -r tag in payment invoices. Overall, the author's proposal offers a potential solution to the problem of exhausted channels in LN and highlights the need for further development in transferring funds between channels.</summary>
