    <summary>The Lightning Network payment protocol does not currently have a method for transferring funds between channels, but there is a "pay yourself" technique that can be used as a solution for rebalancing channels. The author of the message proposes a "refill method" where they pay themselves via a common channel in order to refill their exhausted channel with another party. By using this method, they would only have to pay the base fee once to the common channel instead of paying it multiple times for each micro-transaction.The original message also asks if this is the same as using the -r tag in payment invoices. The proposed method is expected to save a couple of dollars and the author suggests adding a "refill" button in the UI near the channel name. While this method is not as efficient as splice-in, which requires new specs and node software capable of coordinating with one's own, it can still work as an almost-good-enough solution.Overall, the author is new to LN and has been testing it out on testnet. They have encountered the problem of channels getting exhausted and are unsure of how to proceed without incurring high fees. The proposed "refill method" could potentially solve this issue and save on fees.</summary>
