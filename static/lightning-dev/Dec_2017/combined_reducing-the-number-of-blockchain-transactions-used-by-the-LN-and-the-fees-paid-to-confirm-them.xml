    <summary>A computer networking developer new to cryptocurrency has proposed an idea to reduce the number of blockchain transactions and fees associated with frequent purchases from the same merchant over an extended period of time using the Lightning Network. The proposal suggests enhancing the LN with an operation to deposit and withdraw funding in the channel to and from the blockchain without closing the channel, reducing the number of required blockchain transactions by almost 50%. This would be done with a single blockchain transaction that merges the closing and re-opening transactions and sometimes results in smaller fees. The author welcomes comments on the proposal and offers to work with the community to flesh out a detailed specification if consensus can be reached.On the Lightning-dev mailing list, Jim Renkel has presented a similar idea for reducing the number of blockchain transactions used by LN and the fees paid to confirm them. He suggests depositing and withdrawing funding in the channel to and from the blockchain without closing the channel, leading to a significant reduction in the number of required blockchain transactions. The adjustment transaction is never bigger than the closing and reopening transactions put together and sometimes smaller. This reduces the total fees paid for operating the channel. ZmnSCPxj also mentions the "splice in/out" protocol that will exist in BOLT 1.1. If splicing-in is involved, there is a possibility that inputs are forcibly double-spent while the splicing transaction is unconfirmed, making it unsafe to use the channel until the splicing transaction is confirmed. The asynchronous splice-in protocol involves two transactions but can use the channel as soon as splice protocol completes, whereas synchronous splice-in involves only one transaction, but the channel cannot be used until the splicing transaction is confirmed. Overall, these proposals aim to reduce the number of required blockchain transactions and fees associated with frequent purchases from the same merchant over an extended period of time using the Lightning Network. These ideas could lead to a significant reduction in fees paid for operating the channel, and the authors welcome comments and collaboration from the community to flesh out detailed specifications and implementation.</summary>
