    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, participants debated the necessity and potential drawbacks of payment limits for Bitcoin Lightning Network. While some viewed these limits as necessary to prevent centralization, others argued that they hindered important use cases, such as large payment channels and routing of LN payments. The possibility of removing the limits in the future was also raised, with some suggesting that this would encourage the growth of a mesh network. However, concerns were expressed about the risks associated with larger channel sizes and the potential for attacks.In an email exchange between Bitcoin developers Christian Decker and Andy Schroder, the two discuss the issue of large nodes and their impact on the Bitcoin network. Schroder suggests that small channels would be partially self-regulating, but Decker questions the effectiveness of this method, emphasizing the importance of guarding against hubs with many open channels. The Lightning Network uses millisatoshis as the units for its channels, allowing for revenue accumulation from small transactions. The upper 32 bits of amount_msat must be zero for channels with chain_hash identifying the Bitcoin blockchain, giving a maximum HTLC value of .04294967295 BTC.The post discusses the limitations on payment and channel sizes in Lightning Network, with some users finding them restrictive while others argue that they are necessary for security reasons and to encourage the growth of the network towards a mesh network. It is suggested that splitting up large payments into smaller ones through multiple invoices might be a temporary solution until the limits are increased. The article also discusses the issues with splitting single payments into multiple invoices and recommends multipath payments as a simple solution. There was also discussion about rejecting large incoming channels since it could potentially put one at risk of being attacked. However, it was pointed out that the Eclair implementation supports push_msat which could be used instead. In essence, the conversation concludes that setting limits is essential as Lightning is still an evolving software and requires a soft start. The limits encourage decentralization, limit the risk involved if payments get stuck, and make it easier for people to use Lightning. Finally, there is a debate about keeping most funds in cold storage and only a small amount for spending in hot wallets like Lightning nodes. While some see it as a top-down approach that goes against the spirit of Bitcoin, others believe that it encourages the growth of the network towards a mesh network. The article concludes by saying that larger channels can be used in the multi-hop layer, and these changes will make Lightning more useful for intended applications.In a recent discussion between ZmnSCPxj and Andy Schroder about the maximum funding size for channels in Lightning Network, it was revealed that the upper 32 bits must be zeroed out for channels with chain_hash identifying the Bitcoin blockchain. This limits the maximum HTLC value to .04294967295 BTC or approximately $10. The reason for this limitation is to simplify the design of software by imposing a limit only under certain conditions while retaining the same format for all coins. Further discussion revolved around a feature which allows users to hand all the money to the other side, thus avoiding an initial payment.Mark Friedenbach expressed concern that protocol limits would make Lightning useless for his intended applications, and he stated that he would immediately begin work on an alternative fork if such limits were not just training wheels. Rusty Russell responded to Mark's comment, noting that it was unnecessarily aggressive and that everyone needs to take care not to let Bitcoin's mode of discussion leak into Lightning development. Rusty encouraged Mark to contribute to the spec process instead of resorting to creating an alternative fork.ZmnSCPxj joins the discussion, suggesting a limit at the protocol level encourages the growth of the network towards a mesh network rather than more central forms. The conversation continues with discussion about the risks of accepting large incoming channels. Overall, the email exchange provides insights into the ongoing discussion around the capacity limit on Lightning channels. It appears that setting this limit is less critical in restraining the network since it is just between peers. There was also a proposal for a "dangerous feature bit" which would avoid this limitation. However, it is important to note that other cryptocurrencies may have different imposed limits when Lightning gets around to those, but for Bitcoin, this limit still stands. Andy Schroder referred to a previously covered article which highlighted the need to eventually support other similar cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin.</summary>
