    <summary>The Lightning Network faces an issue with micropayments, which are payments less than 546 satoshis, that cannot be recognized by the network as legitimate outputs in transactions. The problem arises because these payments are made through an HTLC output. The inability to make such payments is a concern because it limits the scalability and speed of Bitcoin. Several solutions have been proposed, including adding two HTLCs to the commit to allow microtransactions, but this increases fees and may not translate well over many hops. Another solution is to weaken the dust protection in the network and allow users to clear the dust after three months if it isn't claimed, but this approach can also be costly due to additional fees. Ultimately, culling these outputs and letting them go to fees seems to be the most viable option. However, there have been challenges during implementation due to circular dependency. A proposal was made to tie dust definition to transaction's fee. There have also been concerns regarding the difficulty in solving a problem related to dust amount that depends on minTxRelayFee, which is dynamic and affected by the mempool state of each node. Despite the challenges, tracking and finding workarounds for this issue is important for the success of the Lightning Network.</summary>
