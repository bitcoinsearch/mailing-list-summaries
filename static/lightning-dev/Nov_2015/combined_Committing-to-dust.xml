    <summary>The Lightning Network is a protocol designed to enhance Bitcoin's scalability and speed. However, the network faces an issue with micropayments or payments less than 546 satoshis, which are too small to be accepted as valid outputs in transactions. One solution proposed involves adding two HTLCs to the commit, where both parties pay each other, but with different amounts. This approach increases fees and may not translate well over many hops. Another solution is to weaken the dust protection in the network so that anyone could clear the dust after three months if it weren't otherwise claimed. However, this approach may be more costly due to additional fees. Anthony Towns raised an issue on the Lightning Github page regarding the rejection of micropayments on the lightning channel if they are less than 546 satoshi. Rusty Russell agrees that there needs to be a rule to avoid creating outputs that will be rejected due to their small size. The problem arises when these payments are made through an HTLC output, which is not recognized by the network as a legitimate payment. Russell suggests treating these payments much the same way as sub 1-satoshi payments, by accounting for them exactly in the lightning state but approximating the results in the actual commitments. Ultimately, culling these outputs and letting them go to fees seems to be the most viable option. The issue at hand is that the dust amount depends on minTxRelayFee, which in turn is dependent on the mempool state of each node. In order to solve this issue, a way to decouple minTxRelayFee from dust is needed. Mats Jerratsch proposed a new way to deal with micropayments by adding two HTLCs to the commit. Nicolas Dorier raised concerns regarding the difficulty in solving a problem related to dust amount, which is not constant and depends on minTxRelayFee that is dynamic, and is affected by the mempool state of each node. However, another person disagrees with this and suggests that IsDust depends on the global minTxRelayFee from main, which is not dynamic like the one used in the mempool. The decoupling of mintxrelayfee from dust is necessary, but there have been problems during implementation due to circular dependency. A proposal was made to tie dust definition to transaction's fee. This discussion took place on the Lightning-dev mailing list. Ultimately, tracking this problem and finding workarounds is important for the success of the Lightning Network.</summary>
