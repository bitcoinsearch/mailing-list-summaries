    <summary>A Lightning channel can face problems with sub-satoshi payments hitting the IsDust() test and being rejected. Although these payments cannot be represented as an HTLC output, they could be represented once they complete, which is legitimate. The suggestion to weaken dust protection was made, but it would require paying to an actual (non-standard) script, which would cost more in additional fees than it's going to pay. In addition, adding that output to the transaction would likely incur more fees than it would pay. An alternative approach was suggested to weaken the dual HTLC approach, making attacks unattractive, but it may not be effective. As soon as there is a loophole somewhere, one person will move heaven and earth to make a profit out of it, so adding it to the change amount is not sustainable.The lightning network faces a challenge with dust payments, which are amounts under the minimum relay fee of 546 satoshis. Adding dust to a commitment could cause an inability to access any funds if the channel counterparty disappears. One possible solution is to keep track of dust payments in the lightning state but approximate them in actual commitments. Another option is to weaken the dust protection in the network by having some dust for a finite time. However, this would require paying to an actual script instead of a scripthash and may not be worth it. A third option is to add two HTLCs to the commit, stating that one party pays 1 BTC while the other pays 1.00000001 BTC. This doubles the cost of the HTLC if it gets published to the blockchain, so it may not be the best alternative. The amount of locked capital in the second option may also increase fees significantly. Mats Jerratsch suggested having a special protocol for these payments, but this may not be helpful.Depending on the commitments and whether HTLCs are involved, there are different ways this could play out. Although the dust value has increased to 5430, it is still less than $20, which is considered a micropayment according to Visa. One could anonymously set up two channels with another node and route a whole bunch of dust payments to themselves.</summary>
