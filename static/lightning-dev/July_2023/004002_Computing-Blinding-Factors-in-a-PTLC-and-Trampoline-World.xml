    <summary>The email discusses a confusion regarding the use of a different mechanism in the schnorr multi-hop locks proposal. The sender refers to a specific construction from [1] and states that using trampoline does not affect the protocol. The sender suggests that the trampoline nodes can draw their blinding factors randomly using the right lock they received as the secret. The sender offers to create a diagram similar to the one in [1] for the trampoline scenario to show that the math is correct. A link to the github page is provided.</summary>
