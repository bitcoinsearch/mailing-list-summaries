    <summary>In late June, the annual specification meeting took place in New York City. As an experiment, the attendees attempted to take transcript-style notes, which can be found at this link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MZhAH82YLEXWz4bTnSQcdTQ03FpH4JpukK9Pm7V02bk/edit?usp=sharing. Additionally, the full set of notes is included at the end of the email, although the formatting may not be perfect.The notes aim to capture the discussions that occurred during the summit, rather than providing a concise summary. The speakers are not identified, and any errors in the notes are solely the responsibility of the person who compiled them.Gratitude was expressed towards those who traveled long distances to attend the meeting, as well as Wolf for graciously hosting the event in NYC. Michael Levin also received thanks for assisting with the note-taking process.</summary>
