    <summary>The email thread discussed various aspects of Bitcoin network policies and potential solutions to address issues such as fair transaction selection, efficient node operation, and decentralization. The "top of mempool" assumption was a topic of discussion, considering the goals of transactors, pools/miners, node operators, and those concerned about decentralization. Lightning unilateral closes were also addressed, with suggestions for special cases and specific configurations to include these transactions. The question of whether miners could eventually disregard policy restrictions altogether was raised, arguing that policy restrictions are not necessary from a mining perspective.The concept of zero-fee transactions with ephemeral outputs was explored, explaining their benefits in preventing dust unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). However, concerns were raised about attacking miners creating arbitrary dust UTXOs regardless of fees. The addition of trimmed HTLCs to the ephemeral anchor was considered, clarifying the constraints on value transfer and the violation of zero-fee requirements.A hybrid approach to channel jamming mitigation was proposed, involving monetary measures such as charging for bandwidth and compute resources used in message spam, imposing fees for holding funds in liquidity DoS prevention scenarios, and setting higher fees for actual payments. The profitability of routing traffic and the ability to spin up new nodes at lower fees were mentioned as factors to balance the system.Concerns were expressed about determining small fees and the potential for market influence. It was argued that market dynamics would regulate fee levels, as new lightning nodes with slightly lower fees can attract traffic if network fees are high.The challenge of proving time in case of issues and the reliance on cooperation were discussed, acknowledging that precision beyond an hourly basis may not be necessary due to relatively low amounts involved. Universal clocks were deemed unnecessary, suggesting per-block measurements and reorg/stale block considerations.A specific routing path and payment expiry scenario were analyzed to highlight potential issues with fees and channel closures. It was concluded that this scenario is unlikely and can be addressed by imposing caps on liquidity fees based on the route position and expiry time.The participants resolved that a hybrid approach is needed to address channel jamming, and no further questions or alternative solutions were raised. The email thread provided insightful discussions on Bitcoin network policies, proposed solutions for channel jamming mitigation, and improvements in transaction selection and efficiency.In a separate discussion, Antoine proposed a solution for commitment transactions in the Signal group, suggesting a tapscript branch for unilateral closes instead of using MuSig2 signing. The storage of nonces was reduced by keeping counterparty nonces in volatile RAM, restarting negotiations on reconnection after disconnection.Antoine also addressed static fees in the Lightning Network, advocating for dynamic fees based on demand and liquidity pricing. The topic of reputation in the network was discussed, with challenges in setting a bar for attackers and preventing unfair advantages. Jamming, subjective valuation of resources, and distinguishing forwarding nodes from stereotypical ones were also explored.Paying for the time an HTLC is held in flight was considered, but proving duration without a universal clock posed challenges. The issue of halting channel progress and potential reputation downgrades was raised, suggesting a negotiated grace period for temporary halts due to software upgrades or connectivity issues.Overall, the discussions covered various proposals related to commitment transactions, fees, reputation, and channel progress in the Lightning Network. The conversations delved into topics such as V3 transactions, Taproot upgrade, Gossip protocol versions, multi-sig channel parties, PTLCs, and communication within the Lightning Network community. The annual specification meeting in New York City was also mentioned, with efforts to capture the discussions in transcript-style notes.The discussions provided insights into ongoing development and improvements in the Lightning Network protocol, addressing challenges and proposing solutions for scalability, efficiency, and security.</summary>
