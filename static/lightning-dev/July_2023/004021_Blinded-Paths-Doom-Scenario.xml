    <summary>In a recent discussion about the potential downsides of blinded paths, Bastien raises some valid points regarding the impact on privacy and decentralization in the Lightning Network. Blinded paths encrypt specific routes to reach the recipient node, providing privacy benefits for the receiver by hiding among an anonymous set of nodes within a certain number of hops from the introduction point.However, Bastien questions the necessity of routing payments through "regulated" nodes if the recipient already agrees to share data with them. He suggests that the sender's privacy is primarily preserved by the hops chosen before the introduction point, which can still be freely determined even without using blinded paths. Therefore, aside from limiting potential payment routes for the recipient, there doesn't seem to be a significant difference in the sender's privacy.Ben Carman, the originator of the discussion, introduces the idea that enforcing payments to go through "compliant" nodes could have implications for privacy and decentralization on the network. With blinded paths, the lack of knowledge about the destination node means that payments must be made through one of the given paths. This creates the possibility of a future where recipients not only open channels exclusively with trusted peers but also require payments to pass through a certain number of "compliant" nodes. Consequently, it would bypass the current pleb routing nodes and force users to route their payments exclusively through large regulated hubs.While this approach may enhance payment reliability for the recipient, it poses potential privacy risks for the sender. The need for multiple hops in the payment route increases the sender's dependence on being closely connected to the introduction node or any nodes along the blinded path. If all these compliant nodes engage in data sharing, basic timing analysis could enable them to track a payment as it moves through the network.Ben expresses concern that lightning "chain analysis" companies might pressure businesses into implementing such measures under the pretense of preventing the receipt of OFAC coins. However, he acknowledges that this may be an inherent trade-off in achieving receiver privacy in the Lightning Network and seeks the opinions and awareness of others on the matter.Overall, the discussion highlights potential drawbacks and implications of blinded paths for privacy and decentralization within the Lightning Network.</summary>
