    <summary>The email discusses a different perspective on the monetary approach, specifically in terms of message spam and liquidity DoS. It mentions that charging fees based on the time the HTLC (Hashed Time Lock Contract) was held is considered the "holy grail" for liquidity DoS. However, there is currently no reasonable way to implement this due to the absence of a universal clock and the inability to prove message delivery. As a result, reputation is relied upon for slow jamming and fees are only used for quick jamming. The email also highlights the issue of nodes preferring higher fees for unresolved HTLCs over quickly resolving ones. Additionally, it introduces another variation where the victim tries to impose a fee on the attacker, but faces challenges in proving that someone downstream is holding the HTLC. This variation is influenced by on-chain fees and adds complexity to the situation. Overall, the email expresses gratitude for the interesting content.</summary>
