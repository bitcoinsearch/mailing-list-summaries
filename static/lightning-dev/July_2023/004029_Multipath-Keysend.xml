    <summary>The motivation for multipath keysend is questioned. Instead of making multiple independent keysend payments with different payment hashes, it is important to determine if there is a user need before adding complexity to keysend. This is particularly relevant considering the ongoing work on BOLT 12, which supports multipath and offers a proof of payment [1]. [1] Link: BOLT 12 (https://example.com/bolt12)</summary>
