    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, the potential downsides of blinded paths in the Lightning Network were raised. Blinded paths encrypt specific routes to reach the recipient node, offering privacy benefits for the receiver by hiding among an anonymous set of nodes within a certain number of hops from the introduction point.However, there are concerns about the impact of blinded paths on privacy and decentralization. With blinded paths, payments can only be made through the given paths since the destination node is unknown. This opens up the possibility of enforcing that "compliant" nodes are the only ways to reach a given destination. In other words, users may be forced to route their payments through large regulated hubs, bypassing the smaller pleb routing nodes that currently exist.This approach could potentially hurt sender-side privacy as well. As the number of hops in the payment route increases, payment reliability decreases, making it more likely that the sender needs to be closely connected to the introduction node or any nodes along the blinded path. If these compliant nodes engage in data sharing, they could track a payment through basic timing analysis, compromising sender privacy.One concern raised by Ben Carman, the initiator of the discussion, is that lightning "chain analysis" companies might pressure businesses into implementing such measures under the guise of preventing the receipt of OFAC coins. However, it remains uncertain whether this issue is fixable or if it is a trade-off that must be made to ensure receiver privacy in the Lightning Network.The discussion highlights the potential drawbacks and implications of blinded paths for privacy and decentralization within the Lightning Network. The opinions and awareness of others are sought on this matter.Blinded paths in the Lightning Network offer privacy benefits for receiving nodes, allowing them to hide among a set of anonymous users.
