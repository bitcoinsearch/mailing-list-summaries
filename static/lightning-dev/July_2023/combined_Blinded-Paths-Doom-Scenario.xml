    <summary>In a recent discussion about privacy on the Lightning Network (LN), the potential risks of collusion among hops in the blinded route were brought up. This collusion could compromise the anonymity of end users. Bastien argued that the sender's privacy is preserved by the hops before the introduction point. He believed that even if payments pass through regulated nodes, the identity of the sender remains protected because intermediate nodes are unaware of their proximity to the sender. However, Tony expressed concerns about the negative consequences of blinded paths for privacy and decentralization within the network. He proposed that these paths could be used to bypass regular routing nodes and force users to rely solely on large regulated hubs, impacting both privacy and decentralization. Tony also highlighted the possible impact on sender-side privacy, as closely connected compliant nodes might be able to track payments through basic timing analysis.The overall discussion delved into various aspects of deanonymizing techniques on the LN, the role of blinded paths in safeguarding privacy, and the potential implications for both privacy and decentralization within the network. The participants raised awareness about the challenges and trade-offs associated with achieving privacy while maintaining payment reliability and compliance with regulations.</summary>
