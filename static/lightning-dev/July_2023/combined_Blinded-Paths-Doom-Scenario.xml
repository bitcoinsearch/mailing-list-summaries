    <summary>Blinded paths in the Lightning Network encrypt specific paths to the destination node, providing privacy benefits for the receiving node. However, there is a potential downside to this approach. Since the destination node is unknown, the only way to pay them is through one of the given paths. This can be used to enforce that only "compliant" nodes are allowed to reach the destination.While some regulated businesses today only open channels with specific peers, with blinded paths, it could become a requirement that payments must go through a certain number of "compliant" nodes. This would bypass the pleb routing nodes and force users to route only through large regulated hubs. Although this may improve payment reliability for the receiver, it could compromise sender side privacy. The sender would need to be closely connected to the introduction node or any of the nodes along the blinded path, potentially enabling tracking of payments through basic timing analysis if all these compliant nodes share data.There is a concern that lightning "chain analysis" companies could pressure businesses into implementing such practices under the guise of preventing receipt of OFAC coins. It remains uncertain whether this is a fixable problem or simply a trade-off necessary to achieve receiver privacy in the Lightning Network. The discussion aims to gather opinions and raise awareness about this issue.</summary>
