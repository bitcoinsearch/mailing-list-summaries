    <summary>The email suggests revisiting a post-PTLCs (Pay to Lightning Channel) scenario. In the meantime, it is suggested that classic keysend should be made MPP (Multi-Path Payments). CLN and LDK already support this feature, and it would be beneficial if others did as well. Similar to normal lightning MPP payments, if the recipient chooses to claim less than the amount sent, that is their decision. The sender considers the payment claimed once it has been sent.</summary>
