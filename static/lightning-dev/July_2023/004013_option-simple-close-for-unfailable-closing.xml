    <summary>The email provides details about a "can't fail!" close protocol discussed at the NY Summit and on @Roasbeef's wishlist. The protocol allows each side to indicate whether they want to omit their own output. It is "taproot ready" in the sense that shutdown is always sent to trigger it, allowing nonces without any persistence requirement. The protocol is split into three commits: 1. Introducing the new protocol2. Removing the requirement that shutdown not be sent multiple times3. Removing the older protocols.The first commit is provided as an inline review. The email also includes information about the closing negotiation process, the closing transaction, and the requirements for each node offering a signature. Additionally, it mentions the features related to payment metadata and zeroconf channel types. The email concludes with references to various sections of the BOLT (Basic Open Lightning Technology) documentation.</summary>
