    <summary>The email discusses the suggestion of choosing a different threshold based on the preference of a node. It also mentions potential damage at the protocol-level, such as on-chain fees and automatic force-close in case of low-yield channels. The author acknowledges the non-standardized reaction of target nodes and suggests deferring certain mitigations to future development stages. The author expresses divergence regarding the soundness of the HTLC endorsement solution and refers to previous research on the cost function of adversaries. They highlight the difficulty of formalizing adversary capabilities, information sources, and attacking strategies. The author proposes a reputation-based mitigation strategy that aligns with monetary-based strategies for compensating victims. They mention ongoing simulations for quantifiable criteria and emphasize the use of assumptions in security models. The author also mentions the relevance of modern Bitcoin standards and the need to review past literature on DDoS attacks in the context of a global blockchain ledger.
