    <title>Blinded Paths Doom Scenario</title>

    <summary>Blinded paths in the context of CivKit, a large-scale peer-to-peer electronic market system, can be used by market boards to enforce policies during trade execution or for confidential roles. This involves requesting that makers and takers go through specific lightning nodes associated with the board to conclude a trade escrow over Lightning. This advanced use-case could enable the board to ensure a "fair auction" policy or withhold the blinded path from the offer.From a legal perspective, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU grants strong privacy rights to data subjects, such as Lightning HTLC senders. Whether a Lightning routing hop qualifies as a data controller or processor depends on the collection and retention of personal data by the hop. The GDPR defines personal data as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, including location data, IP addresses, or online identifiers. It is likely that the Lightning payment path falls under GDPR protection.As a result, a Lightning HTLC sender may be entitled to certain rights granted to data subjects, including the right to be informed about data collection, the right to rectification, the right to restrict processing, the right to object to processing, and more. The GDPR has extraterritorial application and has been applied to US big tech and platforms dealing with European personal data. Therefore, requiring a Lightning HTLC sender to go through compliant nodes may not be valid when dealing with European Lightning users.Pseudonymization and encryption are regarded as positive measures under the GDPR framework, and the privacy of individuals is recognized as a human right under EU laws. California also has its version of the GDPR called the California Consumer Privacy Act, which gives individuals the right to opt-out of sharing their personal information. Compliance with privacy legislation requires consideration of constitutional clauses and privileges.While there is some uncertainty regarding new regulations and fast-moving technologies like privacy protection acts and Lightning, it is wise to be conservative. Litigation may arise in the courts in the coming decade, but based on the current state of law, a flourishing economy of business and plebs Lightning nodes is expected to emerge in both Europe and the US.In summary, blinded paths in CivKit can be used by market boards for trade execution policies or confidential roles. From a legal perspective, GDPR and other privacy protection acts grant rights to Lightning HTLC senders, and compliance with these regulations should be considered when dealing with European personal data. Pseudonymization, encryption, and privacy are important elements recognized under EU laws, and California has its own privacy legislation. While there is some uncertainty, the expectation is that business and plebs Lightning nodes will continue to thrive in both Europe and the US.</summary>
