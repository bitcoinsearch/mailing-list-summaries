    <summary>The Lightning Network team is working on upgrading the commitment type of existing channels to taproot without any on-chain transactions using a dynamic commitments concept. The proposal involves introducing two new messages, `commitment_update_propose` and `commitment_update_apply`, which would allow either party to propose a commitment/channel parameter update, but only the initiator can apply it. This approach would also allow for the removal of hard-coded limits such as the in-flight limit for HTLCs and introduce more flexibility in the Lightning Network protocol. Laolu Osuntokun suggested the idea of using dynamic commitments to upgrade channel types on-the-fly and remove hard-coded limits two years ago. He proposed the use of adapter commitments with a protocol for updating commitments on-the-fly, potentially enabling all SegWit v0 channels to be updated to the base level of Taprooty channels without any on-chain transactions. The proposal includes an "adaptor commitment" that upgrades to future Segwit witness versions and allows peers to collaboratively create a new adapter commitment that spends the old v0 multi-sig output and produces a new v1 multi-sig output. However, to implement this concept, a concrete protocol is needed for dynamic commitment updates. Rusty proposed upgrading the commitment type upon channel re-establishment leveraging the new commitment type feature bits, but it doesn't allow both sides to adjust values like dust limit or max in-flight. An alternative approach inspired by the Raft consensus protocol has been proposed, allowing upgrading nearly all channel/commitment related values and involving sending a new config to the leader who synchronizes the config change with other members of the cluster.The Lightning Network team is considering the implementation of the dynamic commitment update protocol, which would enable upgrading nearly all channel/commitment related values and future-proof existing anchored multi-sig outputs in the chain. Using the adapter commitment idea combined with a protocol for updating commitments on-the-fly would potentially allow all 80k+ SegWit v0 channels to be updated to the base level of Taprooty channels without any on-chain transactions.</summary>
