    <summary>Developers on Bitcoin's development mailing list have suggested a new script type for bitcoin transactions in order to improve scalability and enable more flexible transaction structures. The proposal involves three transactions: an anchor transaction, a commitment transaction, and penalty transaction. The developers discussed the issue of deploying a without-inputs SIGHASH flag without also deploying a fee-committing sighash-all. Rusty Russell and A.J. Towns discussed the need for timeout and rhash values to build a script to redeem Hashed Time-Locked Contract (HTLC) outputs that are P2SH. Furthermore, Joseph Poon discussed the need to hand third-parties transactions that can encompass all prior states in a compact way, which is not currently possible with Segregated Witness (SegWit) transactions due to the cost of storing previous signatures. In addition, Rusty Russell mentioned that with SIGHASH_NOINPUT, only the timeout/rval per new HTLC is required to be sent. The developers agree that the new script type would provide greater flexibility and improve scalability for bitcoin transactions, but they also highlighted the vulnerability to replay attacks with the proposal. Joseph Poon believes that SegWit resolves malleability without worrying about replay attacks in the event of key reuse and that it is only safe to use this new sighash type inside segwit itself. The new sighash flag should be used only if its features are needed. Despite this, the developers agree that the new script type would provide greater flexibility and improve scalability for bitcoin transactions.</summary>
