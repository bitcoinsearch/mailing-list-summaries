    <summary>Developers of Bitcoin and Lightning Network have been discussing various proposals to improve the scalability and flexibility of bitcoin transactions. One proposal includes three types of transactions: an anchor transaction, a commitment transaction, and a penalty transaction. The anchor transaction would involve a single output, spendable by 2-of-2 multisig. The commitment transaction would take the anchor transaction as input and include several outputs, including payment to both parties, time-based multi-sig transactions, and Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs). Finally, the penalty transaction would include all the outputs from the commitment transaction and pay a penalty fee to the source of the transaction. The developers also discussed the need for timeout and rhash values to build a script to redeem HTLC outputs that are P2SH. They suggested putting more information in the scriptPubKey to solve this issue. Additionally, Rusty Russell suggested using SIGHASH_NOINPUT instead of pre-signed transactions, which would reduce storage requirements. However, there are concerns about replay attacks and privacy issues when sending information to third-party transaction reclaimers.Joseph Poon discussed the SIGHASH_NOINPUT flag, which does not include the outpoint being spent or the amount as part of the signature but includes the spent outpoint's script. There is also discussion about the need for third parties to have transactions that can encompass all prior states in a compact way, which is currently not possible with Segregated Witness (SegWit) transactions due to the cost of storing previous signatures. Overall, the discussions aim to improve the scalability and flexibility of bitcoin transactions, including the use of new script types, SIGHASH flags, and different transaction structures.</summary>
