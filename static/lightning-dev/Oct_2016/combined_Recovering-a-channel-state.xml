    <summary>The issue of mobile devices being lost or stolen and how to recover data or break channels unilaterally on a new device is being considered by the author. The ability to do a unilateral close, with essential parameters recorded on a server for later retrieval has been proposed as a solution. However, fully recovering a latest channel state seems tricky as it requires trusting a server to never provide an outdated snapshot.The author proposes directly asking the counterparty to provide the latest channel state, but there is no way to check if the snapshot is unrevoked without involving trust. Anton Kumaigorodskiy, a member of the Rusty Russell team, believes that it is important to account for the possibility of mobile devices getting lost, stolen, or data erased. He suggests that there should be a way to recover the channel or at least break it unilaterally on a new device.Tadge has done a lot of work on outsourcing vigilance, which involves uploading encrypted information to watchers. This can almost reconstruct the current state sufficient to mutually close the channel. There's an interesting subset of this which can be done with peers. Each peer would keep some amount of encrypted data for you and always send it to you whenever you first connect. As long as one peer is honest, you get enough state to cleanly shut down the other peers without getting robbed.However, there is still a lot more work to be done in enumerating exactly how this works. The idea of having peers exchange encrypted data to help each other recover channels could be useful in situations where mobile devices are lost or stolen. It is important to discuss this topic and find a solution, as losing the key can result in permanent loss of data.</summary>
