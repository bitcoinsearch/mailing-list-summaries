    <summary>Blockstream developers Rusty Russell and Dr. Christian Decker have successfully demonstrated an end-to-end test of a lightning micropayment network using the v0.5 C lightning prototype. To test the impending prototype, they set up a web server to create invoices for test bitcoin payments over the lightning network. Dr. Decker purchased an ASCII cat picture using 0.01 test bitcoin to open a lightning channel with the server. After paying the invoice with a 100 satoshi transfer, he accessed the link to find his cat picture, discovering it was an ASCII picture, featuring two cats. He promptly opened another node, connected to the first node, and bought a second copy of the cat picture by routing through the previous node. The demonstration included invoicing, multi-hop payment, and item delivery.The team plans to create libraries to allow web developers to construct their own cat picture stores. A video of the demonstration has been provided on asciinema.org. Additionally, there are a few rough edges that they still want to smooth and some documentation that they'd like to write before the 0.5 release.In an email thread, it was noted that lightningd is using port 8334 and namecoind has used port 8334 since it was launched in May 2011. Christian Decker replied stating that it is mostly a coincidence as the implementation will bind to a random port by default, but Rusty fixed the port to 8334 to make the server easier to find. This is the first end-to-end test of a lightning micropayment network, including invoicing, multi-hop payment, and item delivery. Blockstream developers found a few bugs in corner cases and hit some known FIXMEs, but also made lightningd more robust against misconfiguration. There is a Unicode symbol for lightning, U+2607 (â˜‡), which would be 9735 in decimal. This port number is currently unassigned according to IANA.</summary>
