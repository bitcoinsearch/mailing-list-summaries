    <summary>Rusty Russell has proposed an algorithm for bitcoin fees in the context of creating a channel for payment between parties A and B on the Lightning-dev mailing list. The algorithm involves the channel creator paying the fee initially, while making microtransactions to each other within the channel without touching the fee itself. However, if adding an HTLC requires extra fees due to larger transaction sizes, the fee is deducted from the HTLC itself.The algorithm has been criticized as being less exploitable than a naive system but does increase channel capacity slightly. Further discussion and refinement of the algorithm is required to address issues such as how to change fee size when on-blockchain fee market conditions change.In the example provided by the author, a total of 1.000 BTC is to be paid with an extra 1.997 BTC stored in the channel and a required fee of 0.003 BTC for the commit tx. A makes a microtx to B of 0.500 BTC, with an extra fee of 0.001 BTC required for HTLC. Commit tx outputs are described for when the tx is locked or released to either A or B, as well as if it were returned to A. Similarly, B makes a microtx to A of 1.000 BTC, with an extra fee of 0.001 BTC required for HTLC, and commit tx outputs are again described. The algorithm is summarized as follows: the channel creator pays the fee initially, while non-fee parts are shifted around during channel use. Extra fees required for HTLCs are deducted from the HTLC itself, and negative-sized HTLCs are avoided. The author notes that changing the fee size based on blockchain market conditions has not yet been covered.</summary>
