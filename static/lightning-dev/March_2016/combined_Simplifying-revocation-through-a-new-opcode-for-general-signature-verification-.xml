    <summary>On March 8, 2016, Martijn Meijering of the Lightning Network development team proposed a new opcode for signature verification in Bitcoin's scripting system. The proposed opcode would be used to verify appropriately length-restricted messages and could simplify the Lightning Network protocol by eliminating the need to maintain mirror images of transactions and reveal hash preimages. Instead, users could simply sign a message that revokes a previous balance with a hash and sequence number.Meijering expressed concern about overlooking any important factors and suggested that this new opcode could substantially simplify the LN protocol. The proposal was discussed on the Lightning-dev mailing list. This potential change could have a significant impact on the Lightning Network's development and efficiency.</summary>
