    <summary>The encryption and authentication of communications between lightning nodes are described in the Basis of Lightning Technology RFC 1 draft. It is recommended that all communications be encrypted to make analysis more difficult and authenticated to avoid malicious interference. The protocol uses Authenticated Encryption with Additional Data using ChaCha20-Poly1305, and nonces are used to encrypt packet headers and bodies. To authenticate peer identity, the first packet sent must be an authentication packet containing three required fields: bitcoin_pubkey node_id, signature session_sig, and a signature of the SHA256 of SHA256 of the receiver's node_id using the secret key corresponding to the sender's node_id. Public-key cryptography here uses the secp256k1 elliptic curve to avoid additional dependencies.In a discussion between Peter Todd and CJP, CJP shares information regarding the work being done by Jonas Schnelli for Bitcoin on P at P layer encryption. Using a subset of the encryption scheme OpenSSH uses, Schnelli can benefit from all the review that has been done for OpenSSH. The CJP is implementing an encryption layer for Amiko Pay and is interested in using BOLT for encryption. The CJP likes the design as it is generic and simple, making it easy to analyze. A developer is about to implement an encryption layer for Amiko Pay and has questions regarding the Bolt for encryption. The developer wonders about the degree to which communication truly looks like random data or can be distinguished from it and how to protect against timing analysis that could reveal the size of messages being sent. The developer also asks how the authenticate message is distinguished from other messages and suggests including something like a signature of the sessionpubkey, signed with the node_id key to prevent MITM attacks. Furthermore, the developer is unsure about what stops a MITM attacker from duplicating or removing messages and whether there is a certain state preserved between encryption/authentication of different messages. Lastly, the developer asks about the meaning of the ack field in the authenticate message and its usefulness since data streams in both directions are asynchronous.In an email conversation, Rusty Russell explains the derivation of shared secret and encryption keys. Upon receiving the initial handshake, a node can derive the shared secret using the received sessionpubkey point and its own sessionsecretkey scalar using EC Diffie-Hellman. However, he suggests that sessionsecretkey is calculated per libsecp256k1 (used in bitcoin protocol) rather than NIST specification which just uses the x coordinate of the point directly, ignoring y and not necessarily hashing it. He has added wording for this in a GitHub pull request. While multiple choices are possible for public-key cryptography, reusing the secp256k1 elliptic curve used in the bitcoin protocol avoids additional dependencies. However, if secp256k1 breaks and gets deprecated, it would be a backward incompatible change. To handle this, the protocol could increment the high byte of "length" in the first message and old clients would see that as an invalid length, &gt;16M, and refuse the connection. New clients could just treat it as a version byte.</summary>
