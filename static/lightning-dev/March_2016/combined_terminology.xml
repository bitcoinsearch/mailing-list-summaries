    <summary>A discussion was held on IRC to determine a term to use in documentation for the failure mode where a node uses too tight a timeout, which results in the node paying out an outgoing HTLC but being unable to redeem the incoming HTLC. The suggested term of "one-sided redemption" was deemed not punchy enough. It was noted that the timeout for outgoing payments is chosen by the node and if the incoming timeout runs out, the outgoing timeout was too long. A suggestion was made to call it "avoiding timeout on incoming HTLC when forwarding" or something similar.The conversation then moved on to the confusion caused by the term "revocation preimage," which is used as the method to invalidate old transactions between pairs of nodes, but should be avoided from being abbreviated to R. It was suggested that "void" be used to describe the old commitment, with "V" as the symbol for the hash/signature/whatever. There is a risk of one-sided redemption if the R preimage received from an offered HTLC is too late to be used for an incoming HTLC, leaving the node with unexpected liability. Node must estimate the deadline for successful redemption for each HTLC it offers and must not offer an HTLC after this deadline. It is suggested to use the term "invalidate" instead of void as it is confusing since it's a verb and noun.It was noted that "R" for the HTLC "receipt" seems to work okay so it should be kept. Finally, the risks associated with HTLC timeouts were explained, which tend to be chained across the network.</summary>
