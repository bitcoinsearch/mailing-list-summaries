    <summary>The email thread discusses various aspects of implementing Lightning Network (LN) in a Bitcoin wallet, including routing data, making initial payment requests, and potential security concerns. The process of establishing a socket connection to current landmark nodes is suggested for both devices but could be overwhelming for both devices and landmark nodes. A deterministic method has also been proposed to determine which exact node should connect to a given user's ID, which could distribute the load across the network. However, there are concerns about DDoS attacks that could spam a Lightning device with millions of payment requests. To address this issue, Rusty proposes a solution where nodes have an ID and publish their public routes by proving they own the anchor transactions for their channels, with information on routes to and from landmarks stored by every node. To interact with LN, a payment sender needs at least three pieces of "core" data: the required hash of R-value, a list of "full node" URLs where the receiver currently has open channels, and a list of receiver IDs for each "full node." Additionally, the sender may want optional metadata such as name, picture, and address. The "core" data should come directly from the receiver's device, either via the internet or locally through Bluetooth, WiFiP2P, NFC, etc. The author notes that the sender needs a way to verify that the receiver is who they say they are, which means resistance to MITM and identity theft, plus some kind of "name authority" to validate metadata. Therefore, LN users should be able to generate stable identities on their devices using EC25519 keys because of their small size and applicability for both encryption and signing. The email exchange also touches upon the need for stable identities on devices, encryption for transferring core data, and the possibility of a service parallel to LN that can transfer core data in encrypted form. Rusty notes that offline receive is much harder and he does not plan on supporting it in a 1.0 spec. Additionally, Anton raises concerns about how an initial payment request can be made and potential DDoS attacks, which Rusty suggests mitigating via requests rationing using blind signatures but is unsure how to enforce it on a distributed network. In conclusion, the email exchange discusses various challenges and proposed solutions for implementing LN in a Bitcoin wallet, ranging from routing data to security concerns. The need for stable identities on devices, encryption for transferring core data, and a service parallel to LN that can transfer core data in encrypted form are also highlighted. However, offline receive is deemed much harder and not planned for 1.0 spec.</summary>
