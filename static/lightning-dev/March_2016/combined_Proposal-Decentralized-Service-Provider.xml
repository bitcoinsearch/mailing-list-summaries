    <summary>Samuel Kremser has proposed an improvement for the Lightning Network called Decentralized Service Provider (DSP). The DSP would grant end-users access to the network, removing the need to validate the blockchain or worry about closing times of channels. Each DSP would consist of several entities who would manage tasks in a collaborative manner including managing Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals, managing the Lightning Network channel(s), and communication with end-users and the Lightning Network.Multi-sig addresses are used to prevent a single entity from stealing end-user Bitcoins. DSP entities communicate with signed messages with their end-users and with each other, so everything is provable. It is also possible to exclude malicious acting entities from DSPs by transferring control of the managed Bitcoins and channels to new multi-sig addresses/channels that do not require the malicious entity's signature. Fewer channels are required with DSPs, saving space on the blockchain. This would allow users to benefit from more significant channels with more Bitcoins because all users of one DSP would share their channel(s). The idea behind DSPs is that they would be able to provide users with a better experience while still maintaining security and integrity.</summary>
