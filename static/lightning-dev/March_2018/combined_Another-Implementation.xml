    <summary>Kenichi Kurimoto, representing Nayuta Inc., is working on combining cryptocurrency and IoT by developing a Node software based on Lightning Network Specification (BOLT). The BOLT features are currently being tested on a small closed Testnet network with LND, c-lightning, and éclair. Instructions on how to use it on a closed network can be found on their Github page, but the ip address broadcast mode has not yet been tested. Once the node has a valid path to starblocks, payment for starblocks can be done. Kenichi expresses his respect for the people who made the RFC document and would like to contribute further to protocol development.Rusty, who wrote to Kenichi, invites him to join their Google Hangout every two weeks to discuss the specification progress. Rusty also mentions that he has seen many of Kenichi's intelligent questions on the lightning-rfc GitHub.</summary>
