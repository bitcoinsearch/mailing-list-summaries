    <summary>In the Lightning network, the sender node may not always have a direct route to the receiving node, and opening new channels can be expensive. To address this issue, there is a need for a smarter way to open channels that increases the connectedness of the sender node with other nodes in the network while saving money in the intended transaction. One approach involves sorting the choice of nodes to open a channel with by transaction fee and connectedness it brings to the origin node.For instance, if Bob wants to send money to Alice but doesn't have a route to her, he could connect with nodes that have a route to Alice through Charlie/Dave. This would minimize transaction costs and maximize the number of nodes Bob can reach through this channel. By choosing the neighbor of Charlie, for example, Bob can now reach at least three nodes - Charlie's neighbor, Charlie, and Alice - and pay less. This idea has the potential to benefit both Bob in the long term and the Lightning network as a whole.However, the sender node cannot always determine the direction of a channel publicly as it can harm privacy. The Barabasi-Albert model implemented by lnd looks for hub nodes but may cause centralization of the network which would be detrimental to privacy and network availability. Cyclic superhubs are not yet implemented and may encourage a gridlike network with alternate routes but face issues when many nodes are shut down or buggy. To spread counterparty risk among more nodes, atomic multipath payments are necessary. Therefore, feedback on the above concept of channel opening is encouraged.</summary>
