    <summary>In the Lightning network, opening new channels can be costly and the sender node may not always have a route to the receiving node accepting lightning payments. To address this issue, there is a need for a smarter way to open channels that increases the connectedness of the sender node with other nodes in the network while saving money in the intended transaction.For instance, if Bob wants to send money to Alice but doesn't have a route to her, he would need to open a new channel with her which could be expensive if it was the only transaction he ever wanted to do with Alice. However, if Alice was connected to Charlie and Dave, Bob could connect with Charlie/Dave or nodes connected with them which have a route to Alice through Charlie/Dave. This approach involves sorting the choice of nodes to open a channel with by transaction fee and connectedness it brings to the origin node.The sender node cannot always determine the direction of a channel publicly as it can harm privacy. The Barabasi-Albert model implemented by lnd looks for hub nodes but may cause centralization of the network which would be detrimental to privacy and network availability. Cyclic superhubs are not yet implemented and may encourage a gridlike network with alternate routes but face issues when many nodes are shut down or buggy.To spread counterparty risk among more nodes, atomic multipath payments are necessary. By choosing the neighbor of Charlie, for instance, Bob can now reach at least three nodes - Charlie's neighbor, Charlie, and Alice - and pay less. This idea could benefit both Bob in the long term and the lightning network as a whole.In summary, feedback on this concept of using connectedness and transaction fee to choose nodes to open channels with is appreciated. This approach could potentially minimize transaction costs and maximize the number of nodes Bob can reach through a channel. However, the issue of privacy and network availability needs to be addressed.</summary>
