    <summary>Thomas Steenholdt reached out to Christian Decker seeking clarification on the DNS seeds described in BOLT10. The BOLT specifies that DNS seeds should support a list of key-value pairs, but Thomas was unsure about how these pairs are used in a query. Christian clarified that the flags are intended to be used as subdomains in query semantics. For example, querying for only realm IPv4 nodes can be done by using "dig a2.seed.bitcoinstats.com". They also discussed the intended direction of interpreting conditions and what happens if a condition is specified multiple times. They suggested replacing currently set conditions when new conditions with the same key are met, allowing for easy programmatically adding of a condition to a query. Thomas offered to clarify these issues in the BOLT10 specification and make a pull request for review, which was welcomed by Christian. Pull requests are a common way of suggesting changes to open source projects like BOLT10, and it seems that the offer made by Thomas Steenholdt was well received. Overall, this positive conversation highlights the collaborative and community-driven nature of open source development. It shows how individuals can contribute their skills and knowledge to improve technical standards and specifications, benefiting the wider community.</summary>
