    <summary>Thomas Steenholdt reached out to Christian Decker seeking clarification on the DNS seeds described in BOLT10. The specification was vague on the use of flags as subdomains in query semantics. Christian provided examples of how to query for IPv4 or IPv6 nodes with realm 0 or any realm using the appropriate subdomains but pointed out that query filtering itself has not been implemented yet. In the conversation, they addressed two issues related to the intended direction of interpreting conditions and the result of the conflict if a condition is specified multiple times. They suggested a logical approach of interpreting from the seed root and "up the tree" for the first issue. For the second issue, they suggested replacing currently set conditions when encountering new conditions with the same key. This would allow easy addition of a condition to a query programmatically without limiting results.Thomas expressed gratitude for the explanation and offered to help clarify the specification by making a pull request for review. In response, Christian welcomed any improvements to the BOLT10 specification. Thomas proposed an update to BOLT #10 in pull request #396 and suggested addressing some other relevant things such as the intended direction of interpreting conditions and what happens if a condition is specified multiple times. He used the example of r0.a2.n5.a4.n10.seed.example.com to support his suggestions.It is evident that both parties are actively involved in contributing to the improvement of the BOLT10 specification. Pull requests are a common way of suggesting changes to open source projects like BOLT10, and it seems that the offer made by Thomas Steenholdt was well received. This conversation highlights the collaborative and community-driven nature of open source development and shows how individuals can contribute their skills and knowledge to improve technical standards and specifications, benefiting the wider community.</summary>
