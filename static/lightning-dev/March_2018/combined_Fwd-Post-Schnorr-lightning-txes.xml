    <summary>Andrew Poelstra, a member of the Mathematics Department at Blockstream, explained in a post on March 6th how to update states in a payment channel using adaptor/Bellare-Neven signatures. The Lightning-dev mailing list has proposed an even simpler method for updating states in a two-party transaction using joint signing and revocation. For completeness and efficient outsourced channel monitoring, it makes sense to do HTLCs via Schnorr, revealing elliptic curve private keys and ideally making them mostly indistinguishable from regular transactions as a "scriptless script" or "discreet log contract". The Lightning-dev mailing list thread also discusses optimizing for the rare case of misbehavior in closing a lightning channel by using muSig Schnorr pay-to-pubkey transactions. One suggested idea is to use a zero-knowledge proof to confirm a new revocation hash conforms to standards without revealing the secret, where the public key would be generated without using the muSig construct. Another suggestion is to create a pre-signed transaction that spends the commitment tx, giving all channel funds to A after a large CSV timeout, which could provide too much incentive to block someone from accessing the blockchain.Revoking an old state involves sending an adaptor signature for revealing half of AB_i or AB_{i-1}, which gives the other party the secret key to AB_i, allowing them to take the coins. However, blind monitoring may be possible because everything is discrete-log based, which is friendly towards blinding. The author proposes a solution for efficient outsourced channel monitoring in Bitcoin using 2-of-2 multisig funding transactions, which can be converted to Schnorr/muSig when available, and generating six plus eight times the number of HTLCs in-flight transactions every time the channel state is updated.The required state to store consists of these adaptor signatures, which is linear in the number of state updates in each channel. The email thread also includes references to various links and papers discussing the use of blockchain and discreet log contracts.
