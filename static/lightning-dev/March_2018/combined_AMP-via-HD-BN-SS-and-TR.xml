    <summary>The email conversation between ZmnSCPxj and Andrew discusses the concept of atomic multipath payment (AMP) with proof-of-payment and multipath decorrelation properties. The BIP32 hierarchically derived (HD) keys by Wuille are used to derive child keys for integer i. Conditional payments require revelation of the private child key k_i for each public key K_i. Scriptless Script handles only the equivalent of hash locking while Taproot can form the timelock half of an HTLC. The payer derives as many K_i as required for a multipath payment and sets up conditional payments that require revelation of the private child key k_i for each K_i. The payee waits until all partial payments are received and then claims them. Each path has a different k_i, providing multipath decorrelation. Adaptor signatures are discussed as a replacement for hash challenges in a protocol involving timelock scripts. Graftroot is suggested as a powerful feature that nobody has noticed until recently, which allows parties to share a commit transaction. Andrew mentions his ongoing work in understanding Lightning and figuring out better ways to use scriptless scripts.</summary>
