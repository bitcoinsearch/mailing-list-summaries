    <summary>The email discusses the concept of atomic multipath payment (AMP), which has two main properties: it has a proof-of-payment and multipath decorrelation. The author explains the use of BIP32 hierarchically derived (HD) keys by Wuille to derive child keys from a parent key. The author also outlines how a conditional payment can be made, with the payee providing a private key that matches a public key, using Poelstra's Scriptless Script concept, which requires the Bellare-Neven (BN) signatures. Additionally, Maxwell's taproot construction is used to form the timelock half of an HTLC. The author proposes a method for multipath payments, wherein the payer derives multiple child keys and sets up conditional payments requiring revelation of each private child key. The payee waits until all partial payments are received before claiming them, as revelation of any one child key would reveal the parent private key serving as proof-of-payment. This method achieves atomicity in the sense that the payee cannot claim partial payments.The email conversation between ZmnSCPxj and Andrew Poelstra discusses the idea of making atomic multipath payments (AMP) with proof-of-payment and multi-path decorrelation properties. BIP32 hierarchically derived (HD) keys by Wuille are used to derive private and public child keys, and conditional payments require revelation of the private child key for each public key. Scriptless Script handles only the equivalent of hash locking while Taproot can form the timelock half of an HTLC. An "output has different spend conditions depending on who publishes to the chain" primitive using Graftroot is suggested as a powerful feature that nobody has noticed until recently. The email also mentions the use of adaptor signatures which are reblinded at each layer, allowing arbitrary sets of signatures to be made atomic, and using discrete logs as challenges makes reblinding and transferable proof-of-payment easy. The email concludes with Andrew mentioning his ongoing work in understanding Lightning and figuring out better ways to use scriptless scripts.</summary>
