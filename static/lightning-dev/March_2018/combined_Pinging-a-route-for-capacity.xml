    <summary>The Lightning Network has been discussing potential solutions to the issue of insufficient channel balance during routing. One suggestion was to use IP-Fragmentation techniques to split a payment into smaller parts and send them through different routes. However, concerns were raised about how this could impact HTLC timeouts and whether fragmentation could be possible within onion routing. The discussion highlighted the importance of considering all potential security risks and implementing effective safeguards.To improve the feedback mechanism, a new feature has been added that includes channel_updates in the failure message. This updated mechanism provides more detailed information regarding the failure of a particular channel and how it can be resolved. By providing a link to a page that displays all of the updates for that particular channel, users can easily identify any changes or issues that may have contributed to the failure. This feature is particularly useful when multiple channels are being used, as it allows users to quickly pinpoint the specific channel that needs attention.The feedback mechanism with the channel_updates feature is intended to reduce the time required to troubleshoot and resolve issues. Users can quickly take action to address the problem without having to spend hours trying to identify the root cause. Overall, the addition of channel_updates to the failure message is a key improvement to the feedback mechanism, allowing users to identify and resolve issues quickly and efficiently. The feature provides a clear and concise summary of the updates and changes that have occurred, making it easier for users to understand what needs to be done to address the issue.</summary>
