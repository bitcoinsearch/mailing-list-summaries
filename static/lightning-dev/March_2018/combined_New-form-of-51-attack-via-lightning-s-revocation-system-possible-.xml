    <summary>The Lightning Network, designed to provide faster and cheaper transactions on the Bitcoin network, has been identified as vulnerable to a new form of 51% attack that allows an attacker to steal any amount of funds. This attack can be executed by secretly mining enough blocks after fraudulently spending old commitment transactions and keeping it hidden during the to_self_delay period. The attacker could steal up to 99% of all the Bitcoins allocated in the sum of all payment channels they were connected to. The revocation system in its current form allows this type of attack, which is more harmful than a successful 51% attack on the Bitcoin network. There is currently no reasonable way to prevent this form of attack other than creating payment channels that don't offer the possibility of revocation, which goes against the core idea of the Lightning Network. René Pickhardt suggests that no one should have more than two or three times the amount of BTC they own in all the payment channels they have open. In addition, another potential 51% hashing attack involves the attacker setting up a channel with an entity that is funding it with 100% on their side, then routing BTC from another channel through the second and saving the state that they own all the BTC in the victim channel. The attacker would then use 51% hashing power to mine a secret chain that uses the saved state to close the victim channel and claim the funds. This attack vector only allows a 51% miner to steal funds from channels they participate in.To protect against these attacks, individual nodes can contribute hashpower to a decentralized mining aggregator, disallowing more than n channels with a single node, insisting on a blocksize limit and limiting capacities per channel. The block size limit and the channel capacity limit are vital protections against this attack. However, these attacks are deadly to all blockchains, and Lightning is certainly no different.</summary>
