    <summary>A new form of 51% attack has been discovered in the Lightning Network, which allows an attacker to steal an arbitrary amount of funds by secretly mining enough blocks after fraudulently spending old commitment transactions. This type of attack can be executed by secretly mining enough blocks after fraudulently spending old commitment transactions and no one seeing it during the to_self_delay period. The attacker could steal up to 99% of all the bitcoins allocated in the sum of all payment channels the attacker was connected to, making it more harmful than a successful 51% attack on the bitcoin network. There is currently no reasonable way of preventing this form of a 51% attack other than creating payment channels that do not offer the possibility of revocation. The attack would involve the attacker setting up a channel with an entity that is funding it with 100% on their side, then routing 5 BTC from another channel through the second and saving the state that they own all 5 BTC in the victim channel. The attacker would use 51% hashing power to mine a secret chain that uses the saved state to close the victim channel and claim the funds. In this way, the attacker can collect old states worth many multiples of up to 10 BTC and mine them at once. The Lightning developer René Pickhardt warns that he does not see any reasonable way of preventing this form of a 51% attack other than creating payment channels that do not offer the possibility of revocation. However, it is important to note that not having a participant in the network that can 51% attack over a prolonged period is one of the base assumptions in Lightning. These attacks are deadly to all blockchains, and Lightning is certainly no different in that regard.Individual nodes can protect against these attacks by contributing hashpower to a decentralized mining aggregator, disallowing more than n channels with a single node, insisting on a blocksize limit and limiting capacities per channel. The block size limit and the channel capacity limit are vital protections against this attack. An attacker can run many nodes to bypass protection #2.1, but each node at least consumes some resource that could have been used for hashing.This attack highlights the need for security measures in the Lightning Network. It is important to note that creating channels with identifiable entities with whom you have an existing relationship is a defense against this attack.</summary>
