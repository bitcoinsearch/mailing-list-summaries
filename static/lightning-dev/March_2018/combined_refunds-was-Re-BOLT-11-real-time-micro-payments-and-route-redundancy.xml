    <summary>Rusty Russell, a contributor to the Lightning Network, has proposed a solution to fix the limitations of privacy with refund requests. He suggested the inclusion of a smaller return onion in the Lightning Network's Request for Comments (RFC) page. However, Andy Schroder raised concerns about how this would work if the route no longer had capacity or went down by the time the payee sends the refund back to the payer. Additionally, the payer may not know the exact amount of refund that they will receive, making it difficult to determine the best route to build an onion for. Russell acknowledged these potential issues and added them to the brainstorming phase. He also suggested the possibility of returning a reply message on success, but noted that it would only be a best-effort solution and wouldn't appear if the system dropped to chain. The general solution requires the ability to send payments to anonymous destinations, which is currently unavailable. The proposed scheme using round-trip payments was deemed too complex and ineffective as each encrypted hop contains the amount it expects to be sent. Therefore, the inclusion of a smaller return onion is the more viable solution. This proposal is currently under consideration in the Lightning Network's RFC page.</summary>
