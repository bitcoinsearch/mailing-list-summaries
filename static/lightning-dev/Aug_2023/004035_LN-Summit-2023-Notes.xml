    <summary>In a recent discussion, the speaker clarifies their intention behind their comments on monetary-based denial-of-service (DoS) deterrence. They believe that although current implementation work is focused on reputation-based methods, there is still potential for fruitful research in monetary-based approaches. The speaker is concerned that others may have misinterpreted the summit notes as suggesting that monetary approaches are not worth pursuing. They emphasize that their suggested scheme was intended as a rough proof-of-work to support the idea of further research, rather than as an active project or a distraction from reputation-based methods.The speaker addresses the requirement of using the chain tip as a clock or setting up local clocks with each peer, acknowledging the challenge of dealing with slight synchronization issues. They explain that the scheme they proposed involves commitment tx updates, specifically HTLC active updates that tie up the counterparty's liquidity. Proving the sending or non-sending of messages is not necessary in this context, as the commitment tx is already updated accordingly. If messages were not sent but should have been, the channel is considered invalid and closed onchain. The speaker suggests that the need for proving things arises more in reputation-based approaches, where referencing someone else's reputation can help avoid negative consequences to one's own reputation. In monetary-based approaches, the focus is on ensuring payment for services provided and paying for services received.Regarding the scenario of high percentage fees and distant timeouts, the speaker suggests that this situation can be avoided. They provide a sketch of one way to achieve this by setting a price for liquidity reservation over time, receiving payment for the liquidity regardless of whether the payment eventually succeeds or not. The goal is to reach a point where the ongoing cost of holding the HTLC outweighs the chance of success. The speaker also explains that force closing a channel is done when the counterparty deviates from the agreed protocol, which can occur at any time, even due to cosmic rays.In response to a question about the impact on on-chain fees, the speaker clarifies that adjusting the commitment tx balance outputs does not change the on-chain size or cost of the commitment tx. The link to on-chain fees in their outlined scheme is through the cap value. They emphasize the importance of ensuring that the extra profit gained from the adjustment does not outweigh factors such as the liquidity value of locking funds due to unilateral close, unilateral close fees, and channel reopening costs.The speaker briefly ponders the idea of exploring these concepts in an environment that supports millisat/picobtc values and has low fees. They suggest that it may be easier to experiment with these ideas in a system that natively supports picobtc values, possibly via an issued asset on Liquid. However, they acknowledge that setting this up and adapting a lightning client accordingly would likely be quite challenging.In conclusion, the speaker clarifies their intention behind their comments on monetary-based DoS deterrence, emphasizes the potential for further research in this area, and provides insights into the proposed scheme and its implications.</summary>
