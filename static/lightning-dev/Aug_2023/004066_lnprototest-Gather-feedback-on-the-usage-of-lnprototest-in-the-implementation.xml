    <summary>Vincent is currently re-writing lnprototest and is looking for feedback from those who have implemented it or faced challenges while using it. He is collaborating with the cln team on an experimental design that came from their needs, but he believes involving other implementations in the design process would be beneficial. Vincent thinks a framework like lnprototest is becoming increasingly important due to the introduction of features such as BOLT 12, splicing, and dual-funding. Reproducing issues and ensuring protocol integrity has become challenging. Vincent has created a GitHub issue to gather feedback and has provided a link for interested individuals to share their ideas. The feedback issue can be found at [GitHub Link](https://github.com/rustyrussell/lnprototest/issues/105). Additionally, he has shared a link to the experimental design on GitHub at [GitHub Link](https://github.com/rustyrussell/lnprototest/pull/95). Vincent encourages leaving feedback on the email list as well and mentions that he will be monitoring it regularly.</summary>
