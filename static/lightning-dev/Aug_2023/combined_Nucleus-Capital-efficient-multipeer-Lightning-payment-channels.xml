    <summary>In an email, Atomic Mr Nuclear expresses gratitude for the work done on multiparty channel design and raises concerns regarding the feasibility of certain aspects. The first concern relates to the proposal's reliance on an honest majority assumption for safety. Atomic Mr Nuclear questions the practicality of requiring signatures from all participants in a multiparty channel with random peers, as it may hinder the acceptance of payments without cumbersome "full state updates". This raises doubts about the usability of the proposed design.The second concern highlighted by Atomic Mr Nuclear pertains to the exclusion of uncooperative peers, which involves three confirmed onchain transactions. This requirement is deemed excessive in terms of both cost and speed. Atomic Mr Nuclear argues that such a process would be too expensive and slow to serve as a viable alternative to existing designs like Lightning.Taking these concerns into consideration, Atomic Mr Nuclear concludes that the proposal's reliance on "partial state updates" is not feasible for trustless payments. Uncooperative participants would necessitate an expensive onchain process, making the proposed design inferior to existing designs for channel factories and multiparty channels mentioned in the paper.Despite the concerns raised, Atomic Mr Nuclear appreciates the effort put into the paper and expresses interest in further exploration of any overlooked aspects. Additionally, he recommends the author review work posted on the Lightning-Dev mailing list by John Law over the past year, as it may offer potential solutions to similar problems. A link to a collection and summary of John Law's work is provided for reference.The email discusses a new proposal for Lightning multipeer payment channels aimed at improving capital efficiency and liveness. The proposal eliminates the need for inbound liquidity and allows the channel to operate even if up to half of the peers go offline. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on penalty mechanisms and atomic swaps, this proposal enables direct joining of the multipeer channel without locking in liquidity through a network of channels.By removing the requirement for inbound liquidity, the proposal enhances capital efficiency by reducing barriers to entry and increasing user participation in the payment channel network. Furthermore, the proposal ensures liveness by allowing the channel to operate even if some peers become offline. This is achieved through a mechanism that enables remaining peers to continue transacting without disruption, providing improved reliability and availability compared to traditional payment channel solutions.Additionally, the proposal avoids relying on penalty mechanisms or atomic swaps for scaling purposes. Instead, it enables direct peer joining in the multipeer channel, simplifying the payment process and eliminating the need for complex routing algorithms. This approach offers a more efficient and flexible solution, enhancing overall user experience in the Lightning Network ecosystem.Overall, the new proposal for Lightning multipeer payment channels presents a promising solution for improving capital efficiency and liveness in payment channel networks. By removing dependencies on inbound liquidity, penalty mechanisms, and atomic swaps, this approach offers a streamlined and resilient solution for scaling. The direct joining of peers in the multipeer channel facilitates better liquidity utilization and enhances the overall user experience in the Lightning Network ecosystem.</summary>
