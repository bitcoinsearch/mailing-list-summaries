    <summary>The email discusses a new proposal for Lightning multipeer payment channels, which aim to improve capital efficiency and liveness. The proposal eliminates the need for inbound liquidity and allows the channel to continue operating even if up to half of the peers go offline.Unlike traditional approaches that rely on penalty mechanisms and atomic swaps (such as HTLC and PTLC) for scaling, this proposal enables peers to directly join the multipeer channel without establishing a network of channels to lock in liquidity.By eliminating the requirement for inbound liquidity, the proposal enhances capital efficiency. Peers can join the multipeer channel without the need for funds to be locked in advance. This reduces the barriers to entry and increases the participation of users in the payment channel network.Additionally, the proposal ensures liveness by allowing the channel to operate even if some peers become offline. This resilience is achieved by implementing a mechanism that enables the remaining peers to continue transacting without disruption. As a result, the multipeer payment channels offer improved reliability and availability compared to traditional payment channel solutions.Moreover, the proposal does not rely on penalty mechanisms or atomic swaps for scaling purposes. Instead, it allows peers to directly join the multipeer channel, providing a more efficient and flexible approach. This eliminates the need for complex routing algorithms and enables peers to transact directly with each other, simplifying the payment process.Overall, the new proposal for Lightning multipeer payment channels presents a promising solution for enhancing capital efficiency and liveness in payment channel networks. By removing the reliance on inbound liquidity, penalty mechanisms, and atomic swaps, this approach offers a more streamlined and resilient solution for scaling. The direct joining of peers in the multipeer channel enables better utilization of liquidity and improves the overall user experience in the Lightning Network ecosystem.</summary>
