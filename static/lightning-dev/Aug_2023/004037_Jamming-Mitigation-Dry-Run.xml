    <summary>Hi Elias,Thank you for emphasizing the importance of privacy-consciousness in our work. We completely agree with your concerns and would like to address them.To begin with, our ideal collection period for data would be limited to a 6-month period. Our goal is to provide node operators with local tooling that does not require exporting the data at all, but only provides highly aggregated results.Regarding the sharing of data, if individuals are comfortable sharing their data with us, we will handle it according to best practices and ensure that it is not shared onwards. Additionally, fields will be anonymized as described in the original email. In response to your concerns about timestamps, we can also fuzz the timestamps, as only the resolution period matters for our work.We understand that conducting research based on real-world data can be challenging, but we believe it is worthwhile in this case.Best regards,Carla + ClaraOn Thu, Aug 3, 2023 at 4:54 AM Elias Rohrer wrote:Hello Carla + Clara,I want to acknowledge the value of real-world datasets for conducting simulations and empirical experiments on Lightning. However, I would like to bring up some important points regarding the long-term collection of proposed fields.Collecting data over a prolonged period may potentially allow re-identification of anonymous channel counterparties through heuristics correlating with public graph data. This becomes more significant when combining datasets from multiple collection points. It could lead to drawing further conclusions on transferred amounts, channel liquidities at specific times, and even potentially identifying the payment destination based on HTLC settlement/failure timestamps recorded in nanosecond resolution.Considering the sensitivity of this data, trust in the researchers becomes crucial. It would be helpful if you could clarify upfront whether there will be a time-boxed collection period, specify where the data will be stored, and determine who will have access to it. Defining the collection period is important to avoid incentivizing node operators to collect and store HTLC data long-term, especially with such detailed information.Best regards,EliasSource: [Link to email](https://example.com)1. Collect Anonymized Data:We are aware of the sensitivity and privacy concerns associated with the data we are collecting. To address this, we propose a common data format that allows for local analysis by node operators. If exported to researching teams, certain fields marked with [P] must be randomized to maintain anonymity.The proposed format is a CSV file with various fields, including version (to future-proof the format), channel_in and channel_out (short channel IDs of incoming and outgoing channels), peer_in and peer_out (hex encoded public keys of remote peers), fee_msat (fee offered by the HTLC in msat), outgoing_liquidity (portion of max_htlc_value_in_flight occupied on channel_out after forwarding the HTLC), outgoing_slots (portion of max_accepted_htlcs occupied on channel_out after forwarding the HTLC), ts_added_ns (unix timestamp when the HTLC was added in nanoseconds), ts_removed_ns (unix timestamp when the HTLC was removed in nanoseconds), htlc_settled (0 if the HTLC failed, 1 if settled), incoming_endorsed (endorsement status of the incoming HTLC), and outgoing_endorsed (endorsement status of the outgoing HTLC).Before implementing endorsement signaling and setting via an experimental TLV, the last two values will always be -1. However, the data remains highly useful and can be easily updated once the TLV is propagated through the network.Source: [Link to email](https://example.com)</summary>
