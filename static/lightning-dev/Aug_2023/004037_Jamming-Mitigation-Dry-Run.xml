    <summary>In response to Elias' emphasis on the importance of privacy, Carla and Clara express their agreement. They aim to address concerns regarding data storage and access by limiting the collection period to six months. Their goal in establishing a common data format is to provide node operators with local tooling, eliminating the need for data exportation. If individuals are willing to share their data, best practices will be followed to handle this sensitive information, with no further sharing of the data. Anonymization of fields, as mentioned in a previous email, will also be implemented.Acknowledging Elias' concerns about timestamps, Carla and Clara assure that they can fuzz timestamps, focusing solely on the resolution period relevant to their work. They recognize the challenges of conducting research based on real-world data but believe it to be worthwhile in this particular case.</summary>
