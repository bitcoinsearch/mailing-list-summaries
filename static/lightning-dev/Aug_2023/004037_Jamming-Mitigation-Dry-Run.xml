    <summary>The email discusses the importance of privacy and data handling in a research project. The ideal collection period for the data is limited to 6 months. The aim is to provide node operators with local tooling so that they don't need to export the data. If people are comfortable sharing their data, it will be handled following best practices and not shared further. The fields will be anonymized as mentioned in the original email. In response to concerns about timestamps, they can be fuzzed as only the resolution period matters. The sender believes that conducting research based on real-world data is challenging but worthwhile.</summary>
