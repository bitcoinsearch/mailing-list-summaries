    <summary>In response to the emphasis on privacy-consciousness, we agree that it is important to clarify certain aspects before proceeding with the work. It would be helpful to determine upfront if there is a limited timeframe for collecting the data, as well as where the data will be stored and who will have access to it.Our preference is to have a collection period of 6 months. The purpose of defining a common data format is to provide node operators with local tools, eliminating the need for exporting the data. Only highly aggregated results would be shared, and we will adhere to best practices to ensure the sensitive information remains confidential. Additionally, the fields will be anonymized, as explained in the original email. Regarding concerns about timestamps, we can alter them to add fuzziness, as the resolution period is what matters for our work.
We hope these measures address your concerns. We understand that conducting research based on real-world data can be challenging but believe it is worthwhile in this case.</summary>
