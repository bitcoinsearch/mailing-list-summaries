    <summary>In this email, Antoine discusses the safety of certain districts in Oran and Algier for tourism. He mentions that these districts are considered safe by the US travel advisory. However, he is unsure if the rate of high-violence in these areas is worse compared to cities like San Francisco or New York if one were to find themselves in the wrong area.Antoine then brings up the topic of high-violence Islamic countries with a population that holds fundamentalist beliefs. He sadly notes that this statement can also be applied to France, as he was present in Paris during the Bataclan terrorist attacks. He emphasizes the importance of following general thumb rules when traveling abroad, such as avoiding dirty places, staying in a group, maintaining situational awareness, and taking precautionary measures.Antoine acknowledges that dealing with visas can be quite cumbersome and time-consuming. This is why he has been working on organizing an event in Africa a year in advance. He suggests lobbying for e-visas programs worldwide to replace paperwork applications with zkp-based bitcoin fidelity bonds to expedite visa processing times.In conclusion, Antoine encourages Peter to take proactive steps in advocating for more efficient visa processes and signs off with "Best, Antoine."</summary>
