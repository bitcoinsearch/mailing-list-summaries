    <summary>The sender, Vincent, is addressing Elias and discussing privacy concerns. Vincent mentions two main reasons why he doesn't see a privacy concern. Firstly, the dry run will be conducted on a selected node, so it is not a significant issue. Secondly, Vincent emphasizes that the leaked privacy fields are meaningless from an analysis perspective and can be faked using core lightning. It is important to ensure that the fake channel ID remains consistent. Vincent explains that they care about this point to make their research results 100% reproducible and involve more people in verifying and proving any potential errors. They acknowledge the limitation of using data from real nodes with real bitcoin involvement, as it may create a bubble of certainty. Vincent also questions if anything is being overlooked regarding faking the channel ID and the node pub key. They mention previous examples where PhD programs failed to start due to the lack of real data.</summary>
