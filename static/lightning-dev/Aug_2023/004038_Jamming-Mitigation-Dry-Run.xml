    <summary>Vincent expresses his lack of concern regarding privacy issues for the selected node running the dry run. He states that he is not buying anything significant with his research node, so there is no real privacy threat. The only potential privacy leak he identifies is certain fields, but they are irrelevant from an analysis perspective and can be faked using core lightning. He emphasizes the importance of ensuring that the fake channel ID remains constant to achieve 100% reproducibility and allow more people to verify and identify any mistakes. Vincent worries about being confined to a limited data set from real nodes and real bitcoin transactions, which may result in a lack of certainty. He questions if there is something he is missing regarding faking the channel ID and node pub key. Vincent also mentions that he has witnessed PhD programs failing to start due to a lack of real data examples.</summary>
