    <summary>Vincent clarifies that he did not intend to suggest that Elias' points were incorrect. He apologizes if he gave the wrong impression. Vincent expresses his desire to understand Carla and Clara's proposal regarding a dry-run. The purpose of the dry-run is to test if the theory holds up in practice by selecting a few nodes and sharing the data. Vincent suggests that a small number of nodes would suffice due to the localized nature of reputation. Each node builds its own reputation. Vincent understands that the dry-run involves selected nodes. Once the direction is clear, they can prioritize privacy and expand data collection over time. Vincent agrees with Elias that privacy protection for nodes and channels should be considered. He acknowledges Elias' point about continuous data collection for tracking the network's evolution. Vincent mentions that reverse engineering is possible to reconstruct missing parts of the graph. However, his main point is that running data collection for several months might make the privacy concerns seem overly complex. Vincent assumes that trust in the source of the data is necessary. He agrees that conveying goals, underlying purposes, and addressing potential drawbacks is important. Vincent appreciates Elias' insightful reflection points.Note: The links mentioned in the email text were not included in the summary as per the guidelines provided.</summary>
