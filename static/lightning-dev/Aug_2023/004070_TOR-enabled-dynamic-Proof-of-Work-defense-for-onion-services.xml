    <summary>The email discusses the introduction of a dynamic proof of work system and a market-based auction system for bandwidth by the TOR project to combat DoS attacks. The sender mentions that although their problems differ from ours, there are enough similarities to justify the relevance of this information. The technical document provided in the email mentions that the new patch cannot defend against a large botnet and suggests investigating anonymous credentials and other techniques.The sender expresses surprise that the TOR project did not consider using Bitcoin or a mining protocol directly, such as through Lightning Network paywalls. Instead, they argue that the auction-based bids are more suitable than a static difficulty target used in Bitcoin. However, the sender believes that the dynamic properties of the auction mechanism could have been achieved by the amount of sats (bitcoin units) being offered instead of a dynamic proof of work solution.To read more about the TOR project's introduction of the proof of work defense for onion services and the technical document, you can visit the following links: - Introducing Proof-of-Work Defense for Onion Services: [link](https://blog.torproject.org/introducing-proof-of-work-defense-for-onion-services/)- Technical Document: [link](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/torspec/-/blob/main/proposals/327-pow-over-intro.txt)Regards,Rene Pickhardt</summary>
