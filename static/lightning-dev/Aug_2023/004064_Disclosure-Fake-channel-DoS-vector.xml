    <summary>A DoS (Denial of Service) vector was discovered last year that affects all node implementations. This vector allows an attacker to open numerous fake channels to the victim without publishing them on-chain, resulting in the victim consuming excessive resources. To mitigate this risk, defenses against the DoS have been included in recent releases of various node software versions.The following releases include the necessary defenses:- CLN 23.02 [1]- eclair 0.9.0 [2]- LDK 0.0.114 [3]- LND 0.16.0 [4]If you are currently running a node software version older than the ones mentioned above, your funds may be at risk. It is strongly recommended to update your node software to at least one of the specified versions in order to help protect your funds.For more detailed information about the DoS vector, you can visit the link provided: https://morehouse.github.io/lightning/fake-channel-dos.(Note: The farewell part of the email has been ignored as per the instructions.)</summary>
