    <summary>In the email, the sender mentions the possibility of a hard penalty being more suitable for a paid service where there is an expectation that the service functions properly. They also bring up a generic "latest state backup" oracle scheme proposed by Thomas that could be useful for applications outside of Lightning. The sender suggests forwarding this idea to bitcoin-dev to reach a wider audience.There is a question regarding whether Phoenix, a centralized entity, informs users when an issue occurs. The desired outcome would be for people to become aware of any problems and share their concerns on social media. It is mentioned that the most likely reason for triggering such issues would be a mistake made by Phoenix rather than malicious intent. The sender argues that having clients loudly shut down their usage of Phoenix temporarily in response to these mistakes can ultimately protect Phoenix from its own errors. Although this may have a negative impact on Phoenix's reputation in the short term, it is believed to be beneficial in the long run.The email concludes with a link to Peter Todd's website (https://petertodd.org) and his email address (peter@petertodd.org).</summary>
