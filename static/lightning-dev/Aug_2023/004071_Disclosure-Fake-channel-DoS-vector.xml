    <summary>The email begins with the sender, Antoine, addressing someone named Matt. Antoine expresses his dissatisfaction with Matt's attempt to speak on behalf of something or someone without having sufficient knowledge or experience. Antoine believes that Matt's statement is false and ignores the hard work and improvements made over the past few years. He urges Matt to prioritize the security of the users' funds over a reckless attitude of "move fast and break things." Antoine mentions that he will continue to speak on behalf of the LDK project, regardless of whether Matt is pleased or not. The email ends with a farewell from Antoine.</summary>
