    <summary>The discussion revolves around the concept of probability in the context of anonymity. The writer acknowledges the point made by someone and expresses willingness to consider another perspective. They argue that talking about probability only makes sense if peers are fully anonymous, which is not currently the case. The writer explains that an attack begins even before there is an open channel with the victim. Once an attacker identifies a target, they attempt to establish a channel with the victim with the intention of exploiting them. The victim is already vulnerable in some way, but they are unaware of it. From this viewpoint, the event of Alice attempting to restore from seed at a particular moment is seen as something the attacker had planned all along, rather than a random occurrence. It is considered the last step in the attack, rather than the first. The email raises important questions about the nature of attacks and the vulnerability of individuals. To fully understand the implications of probability in such scenarios, it is necessary to consider the level of anonymity among peers. The conversation highlights the need for further exploration and analysis in this area.</summary>
