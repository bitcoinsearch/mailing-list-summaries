    <summary>We are proceeding with the plan discussed at the summit to conduct a "dry run" of HTLC endorsement and local reputation tracking. The objectives of this plan are to validate the behavior of local reputation algorithms using real-world data, gather liquidity and slot utilization data for resource bucketing, and establish a common data export format for analysis.The plan consists of several phases. Firstly, we will collect anonymized forwarding data in a CSV file format. This format includes fields such as version, channel IDs, peer information, fee offered by the HTLC, outgoing liquidity and slots, timestamps, and settlement status. Certain fields marked with [P] must be randomized if exported to researching teams.Next, we will propagate an experimental TLV called "endorsement" through the network. This TLV will be included in the `update_add_htlc` message and will indicate whether the HTLC is endorsed or not. Forwarding nodes will propagate the same value they receive or set it to 0 if not present.Finally, we will implement local reputation algorithms and actively set the value of the `endorsed` TLV for outgoing HTLCs. This signal will be used solely for data collection purposes. It is suggested that senders choose a probability (default: 20%) to set `endorsed=1` for their payments.Throughout this process, we prioritize privacy and ensure that sensitive information is protected. We encourage node operators to participate in data collection and welcome any questions or assistance. For more details and references, please refer to the email.</summary>
