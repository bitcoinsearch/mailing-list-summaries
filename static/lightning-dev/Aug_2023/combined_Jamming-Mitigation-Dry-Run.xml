    <summary>Elias commends the importance of privacy-consciousness in the collection of real-world datasets for Lightning simulations and experiments. He raises concerns about potential re-identification of anonymized channel counterparties and urges clarification on the time-boxed collection period, data storage, and access control. Elias suggests defining a common data format for local analysis and emphasizes the need to randomize certain fields when shared with researchers.In response, Carla and Clara assure that the ideal collection period would be limited to 6 months. They emphasize that their intention is not to share the data onwards and highlight their commitment to handling sensitive information according to best practices. They also mention the possibility of fuzzing timestamps to preserve privacy. Despite the challenges, Carla and Clara believe that research based on real-world data is worthwhile.To address the sensitivity of the data, a proposed common data format is outlined. It is a CSV file with various fields including version, channel IDs, peer pubkeys, fee offered, outgoing liquidity and slots, timestamps of HTLC addition and removal, HTLC settlement status, and endorsement status. Some fields marked with [P] must be randomized if exported to researching teams. The format is future-proofed with a version field and allows for easy updating once the experimental TLV for endorsement signaling is propagated through the network.The research plan involves conducting a "dry run" of HTLC endorsement and local reputation tracking using real-world data. It aims to validate local reputation algorithms, obtain liquidity and slot utilization data, and provide a common data export format for analysis. The plan includes multiple phases such as collecting anonymized data, propagating the experimental endorsement TLV, and implementing local reputation algorithms.To reference the work being done by each team, links to their respective GitHub repositories and pull requests are provided. Eclair focuses on collecting local reputation data, CLN works on propagating the endorsement field and creating a plugin for local reputation scoring, LND works on data export and HTLC endorsement, and LDK requires additional plumbing work.In conclusion, the research plan seeks to collect real-world data, validate local reputation algorithms, and obtain liquidity and slot utilization data. It proposes a common data format, emphasizes privacy-consciousness, and involves multiple teams working on different aspects of the plan. The provided links serve as references for further information on the work being done by each team.</summary>
