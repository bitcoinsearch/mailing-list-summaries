    <summary>Vincent apologizes for any misunderstanding and clarifies his understanding of Carla and Clara's proposal. They are implementing an algorithm to test a theory and will select a few nodes to enable this feature and share the data. Vincent assumes that a dry-run will be conducted with selected nodes, and once they understand the direction, they can prioritize privacy and potentially expand data collection over time. He agrees with Elias that privacy concerns should be considered, especially regarding nodes and channels. Elias expresses confusion about collecting data from real-world forwarding nodes instead of creating synthetic/research datasets. He explains how it may be possible to re-identify node ids and channels by correlating the dataset with publicly available data. Elias suggests using timestamps and datasets from neighboring nodes to derive which anonymized clusters correspond to real-world clusters. He also mentions the estimation of HTLC amount and drawing conclusions about channel liquidities and network-distance of the HTLC destination. Elias emphasizes the need to clearly communicate the framework and associated risks of data collection to node operators. Carla and Clara clarify that only aggregated results will be shared by default and timestamp fuzzing can be used to obfuscate when payments took place. Elias raises concerns about long-term collection potentially allowing re-identification and suggests clarifying the collection period, storage location, and access to the data. Vincent responds to Elias, stating that he doesn't see privacy concerns for the selected node running the dry run. He mentions that fake channel IDs can be used to protect privacy and allow verification of research results. Vincent believes that using real data is necessary to avoid being limited by a lack of real-world data and encourages sharing raw data to involve more people in verifying and proving their work. Elias thanks Vincent for emphasizing the importance of privacy-consciousness and asks about the storage and access of the data. Carla and Clara assure Elias that they will handle sensitive information following best practices and only share very aggregated results. They explain that fields will be anonymized and timestamps will be fuzzed. They also mention that clearly defining the collection period is mandatory to avoid long-term collection of detailed data. Elias thanks Carla and Clara for addressing his concerns. Carla and Clara summarize the plan to "dry run" HTLC endorsement and local reputation tracking to mitigate jamming attacks. They list the goals of using real-world data, obtaining liquidity and slot utilization data, and providing a common data export format. They mention the phases of the plan and the teams involved. They explain the research plan, including collecting anonymized data, propagating an experimental endorsement TLV, and implementing local reputation algorithms. They provide details about the proposed data format and the signaling and setting of the endorsement TLV. They conclude by mentioning references for further information.</summary>
