    <summary>In the given context, Elias is addressing Carla and Clara to discuss the collection of real-world datasets for conducting simulations and empirical experiments on Lightning. Elias acknowledges the limitation of available datasets but highlights the potential for re-identifying anonymized channel counterparties by combining datasets from multiple collection points.Elias suggests that long-term collection of these proposed fields could provide insights into transferred amounts, channel liquidities, and even the payment destination's identity. However, he emphasizes the need for trust in researchers due to the sensitive nature of the data. Elias requests clarification on the time-boxed collection period, data storage, and access control to ensure best practices and prevent indefinite collection of detailed HTLC data.To address the sensitivity of the data, a common data format is proposed, allowing analysis tooling to be built around it. The format is a CSV file with various fields, including version, channel IDs, peer pubkeys, fee offered, outgoing liquidity and slots, timestamp of HTLC addition and removal, HTLC settlement status, and endorsement status. Some fields marked with [P] must be randomized if exported to researching teams.Elias notes that the proposed format is future-proofed with a version field and mentions the potential inclusion of endorsement signaling and setting via an experimental TLV. Currently, the endorsement status fields are set to -1, but they can be updated once the TLV is propagated through the network. Despite this, Elias emphasizes the usefulness of the existing data format in the meantime.Overall, Elias raises important considerations regarding the collection, storage, and access of sensitive data, while proposing a standardized format for analyzing the collected datasets.</summary>
