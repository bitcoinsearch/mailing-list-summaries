    <summary>In the email, Antoine discusses his work on defending against a large botnet and suggests investigating anonymous credentials as one of the techniques. He mentions that during the Zurich lightning event in 2021, the idea of bip154 was discussed but discarded because it wouldn't fit the hashrate capabilities of a large botnet in the real-world scenario of a mobile-first client with constrained CPUs. Antoine also mentions being aware of the Tor scheme for a while.Antoine goes on to talk about his implementation of Privacy Pass, which he calls Staking Credentials. He explains that he is primarily replacing cryptosystems with elliptic curve-based ones, as opposed to blinded RSA like the IETF draft. The credentials are loaded with sats as a user challenge. Antoine is currently working on a Rust implementation that is architecture-agnostic to fit the Lightning Network and Nostr-based services/routing purposes.Antoine expresses his anticipation for a game-theory formalization of the system dynamics. He signs off with "Best" and includes links to two resources: one about a reputation credentials proposal to mitigate LN jamming attacks and another about an IETF draft on RSA blind signatures.Overall, Antoine's email covers his work on defending against a botnet, his implementation of Staking Credentials using elliptic curve-based cryptosystems, and his desire for a game-theory formalization of the system dynamics.</summary>
