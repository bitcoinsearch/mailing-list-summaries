    <summary>A proposal has been made to increase the capital requirement of channel-jamming attacks by Eugene Siegel in a Lightning-dev mailing list. The proposal suggests preventing an unsophisticated attacker with low capital from jamming a target channel. Siegel proposes trimming dust HTLC outputs in the commitment transaction, allowing non-dust HTLCs to be included on the commitment tx. Bastien TEINTURIER responded to this proposal stating that dust HTLCs count for the 483 HTLC limit due to `update_fee`. If they are not counted and the limit is exceeded, the fee cannot be lowered anymore. This can lead to more than 483 HTLC outputs in the commitment, opening the door to other kinds of attacks. While Eugene Siegel believes it is a free mitigation without any downsides besides code-writing, there may be other drawbacks if the proposal is scrutinized enough with an attacker's mindset. Upon closer inspection, it appears that the spec already includes a statement advising against counting dust HTLCs. This information was brought to light after Eugene Siegel raised a concern regarding the possibility of lowering the feerate. However, it is important to note that there is currently no in-protocol method for changing the dust limit, rendering the aforementioned concern irrelevant. It has been acknowledged that the same mistake had been made in the past and will be rectified moving forward. It remains to be seen whether Siegel's proposal will be implemented or not.</summary>
