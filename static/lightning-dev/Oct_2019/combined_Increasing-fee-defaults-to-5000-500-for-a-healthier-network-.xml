    <summary>Rusty Russell, a bitcoin lightning network developer, has proposed changes to the default fees on the lightning network. In his message to the Lightning-dev mailing list, he argued that the current default of 1000 msat + 1 ppm is problematic for two reasons. Firstly, low fees are now seen as a negative signal, indicating lower reliability, and routing gets tarpitted trying them all. Secondly, there's no meaningful market signal in fees since you can't drop much below 1ppm.To address these issues, Rusty proposed changing defaults on new channels to 5000 msat + 500ppm as of the next release of c-lightning. He chose 500ppm because it's still 1% at 20 hops, so minimally centralizing. The idea is that this should move the noise floor up gradually over time. However, the proposal was not well received by some, who argued that raising default fees would be misguided.Instead, these individuals suggested that developers should focus on educating prospective routing node operators on best practices and providing analysis tools to help with channel management and liquidity allocation decisions. They believe that market participants should converge on steady-state economically rational fees rather than having them set by default.</summary>
