    <summary>The Lightning Network is a proposal that aims to provide instant payments on the network by automating inbound liquidity with invoices. The proposal suggests embedding the node URI of the invoice creator along with the amount to be routed in the invoice, which will enable wallets to auto-open channels and push payment. However, there are challenges with this idea, such as push_msat functionality not working for non-custodial setups. Additionally, while an HTLC payment can be used once the channel is deep enough, you'll have to wait until the channel is locked to receive the money and be able to spend it.Muun Wallet has implemented a feature that allows users to scan an invoice and open a channel directly if there is not enough capacity in the route to the destination node. However, this feature may not be suitable for all use cases due to time constraints and should only be used for topping up one's own node.ZmnSCPxj, a Lightning Network developer, discussed two separate topics related to the network. To set up incoming liquidity, he suggested creating a channel to a high-uptime node on the network using a submarine swap to pay offchain funds to buy onchain funds. However, this method requires onchain funds, and an auto-system could eventually be implemented. ZmnSCPxj also discussed just-in-time routing, a concept that would allow routing nodes to implement the idea of routing payments "just in time," even if there aren't any pre-existing routes to the destination. However, there are some difficulties in implementation, and trampoline routing would greatly help this idea.The proposal for embedding the node URI of the invoice creator along with the amount to be routed suggests establishing auto channels and pushing payments to help users receive and send payments instantly while hiding everything from them as an end-user. This is only for routing nodes and not all LN nodes. The size of Bob's channel and charging premium by routing nodes who provide this service are important considerations. Overall, this proposal offers benefits such as instant payment transactions and improved privacy for end-users.In summary, while there are challenges associated with the Lightning Network proposal for automated inbound liquidity with invoices, it offers benefits such as instant payment transactions and improved privacy for end-users. Muun Wallet has implemented a feature to address some of these challenges, but it may not be suitable for all use cases. ZmnSCPxj has proposed a practical way to set up incoming liquidity using on-chain funds, which gives users control over what nodes to make channels with and would be a good investment in their future accessibility over the Lightning Network. Additionally, ZmnSCPxj discussed just-in-time routing, which could improve payment routing even if there aren't any pre-existing routes to the destination.</summary>
