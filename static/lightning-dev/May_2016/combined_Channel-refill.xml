    <summary>The Lightning Network has some limitations, including the inability to receive a single payment larger than the amount currently locked in a channel. Additionally, one cannot make payments once their side of the channel balance reaches zero. To address these issues, the proposed solution is to implement a "channel refill" procedure. This process would involve using the same pair of commit_keys resulting in a second utxo on anchor address. Kumaigorodskiy Anton suggested that the current limitations of Lightning Network could be addressed by implementing a channel refill procedure which would allow users to receive payments larger than what is currently locked in a channel, issue multiple small invoices and make payments even after their side of channel balance reaches zero. Rusty Russell, an expert in Bitcoin and Lightning Network, agreed with this idea and referred to it as "re-anchoring."Re-anchoring involves creating a new funding transaction that spends the old one plus additional inputs and providing signatures for both transactions until the new one has become deep enough to drop the old signatures. This process could also be used to pay non-Lightning bitcoin addresses. Russell believes that re-anchoring will likely be the first extension implemented once the basics of Lightning Network are sorted out.On May 12, 2016, the Lightning team held a meeting in Kyiv, Ukraine to discuss potential improvements for the Lightning Network. One topic discussed was the issue of edge cases where one cannot receive a single payment that exceeds the currently locked-in channel capacity. The proposed solution was to implement a "re-anchoring" or "channel refill" procedure. One advantage of the refill method over creating a new channel is that overall channel capacity would grow each time, meaning that after several refills, no more may be needed for an extended period. Re-anchoring could potentially solve the two main concerns regarding receiving large payments and making payments when the channel balance reaches zero.</summary>
