    <summary>The email exchange between Rusty Russell and LaurentMT discusses the update of routing tables in relation to Lightning Network (LN). The process involves landmark nodes sending periodic messages to update routing tables. Nodes wait for a delay before forwarding the message, allowing them to receive the same message from a better route. Fees are associated with nodes, and they suggest that simulations could offer insight into routing table updates in LN. The "base+per-satoshi" fee model creates difficulty in defining the best route. They suggest nominal values and forwarding a set of best routes for each range of amounts. They also discuss the association of fees with individual payment channels and how it may be useful to cope with unbalanced channels. The author raises the question of whether simulations would be useful and mentions the literature using the term "landmarks". They haven't decided on an update strategy for the routing tables yet but mention that price changes phase in over time. There's also the question of how to handle false advertising, and the author suggests broadcasting the response from a node which refuses to route your payment.</summary>
