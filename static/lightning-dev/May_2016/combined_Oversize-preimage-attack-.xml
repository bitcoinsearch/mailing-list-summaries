    <summary>The context describes Rusty's plan to modify the HTLC scripts by adding "OP_SIZE 32 OP_EQUALVERIFY" at the beginning of the scripts, which will define the length of a scriptsig that redeems a transaction. This change will also drop the per-side HTLC limit from 1500 to 450 in BOLT #2, simplifying the protocol and reducing the cost of stealing the inputs. The limitation of no on-chain restriction for the preimage size was discussed, which could result in non-standard transactions that may not propagate. However, Segwit's witness program validation logic checks each element of the passed witness stack before execution itself, ensuring that the pre-image size is less-than-or-equal-to the maximum script element size of 520 bytes. A similar modification was made to their scripts by Olaoluwa Osuntokun, who discussed the requirement of using a 110k preimage to redeem and dropping it to the blockchain. In response, Rusty thanks Olaoluwa Osuntokun for sounding the alarm with the mailing-list post and enquires about any other issues that may have been missed.</summary>
