    <summary>The author of the 02-wire-protocol.md draft created a simulator to test the protocol and generate timing diagrams. The revocation reply process is said to work well in all corner cases, making acknowledgement numbers unnecessary. Interested parties can find a layman's write-up at https://medium.com/@rusty_lightning/lightning-inter-node-protocol-a-primer-c642816c8b8#.8skw6hfar.Pierre expresses satisfaction with the newly implemented protocol and indicates that he was able to pass scripted tests on his toy version. He hopes this will lead to a non-regression test set for the Lightning Network. Rusty agrees and mentions his eventual desire to have canned conversations for testing BOLTs against. Pierre questions why "nocommitwait" is optional in the test and why sending successive commits would be forbidden. Rusty explains that it is simpler to not allow multiple in-flight commits and that only one set of outstanding changes is needed. Rusty then defines YA as "Yet Another."</summary>
