    <summary>The Lightning Network mailing list has seen little activity, with most discussion taking place on the Github repository related to the network. Concerns have been raised about the feasibility of the Lightning Network without the activation of SegWit, which appears stalled at around 26%. However, developers believe that if SegWit does not activate, there is something wrong with Bitcoin and its adoption is necessary for improved functionality. Miners are cautious about upgrades, but adoption will take time to roll out across products anyway. The issue of security problems in relation to having to watch the blockchain was raised, and outsourcing this job to a server was suggested as a solution. However, outsourcing poses a problem as you cannot hand the outsourcer a penalty transaction signature if you don't know what the bad transaction will look like. Stefano Pepe, CEO of UniquID Inc., expressed interest in helping with the evolution of Lightning Network (LN) and Segwit. Discussion continued on the mailing list regarding the possibility of creating OP_CLTV/OP_CSV-style channels that are malleability-resistant without using revocation methods. In a separate discussion on Bitcoin Stack Exchange, the issue of outsourcing blockchain monitoring was raised as a possible solution to security problems. However, outsourcing is not yet viable due to the problem of setting up new channels with strangers on the internet who could coordinate with miners to prevent users from reclaiming their funds. Rusty Russell proposed a possible solution using BIP 62 and having only one side pay into the funding transaction, but third-party malleability could cause issues. To mitigate this scenario, Russell suggests having two outputs in the funding transaction, with one P2PKH output going back to the sender. Andres G. Aragoneses suggested that miners are afraid of losing their fee-gathering monopoly for moving money to layer2-actors, given that it will be much easier to spawn paymenthub nodes than mining nodes. However, this is a common misconception since Lightning does not reduce the fees that the miners may collect; instead, it increases their reach into transactions that they could not otherwise serve.Andrés G. Aragoneses asked if it would be possible to have an alternative Lightning-Level2 without SegWit, but still with CSV. He suggested using shorter locktimes like the Spillman-style payment channels do every time there's a need to change direction. The lightning paper itself was designed around "level 0" when there wasn't even an OP_CLTV. Discussion on the mailing list centered around the three levels of Lightning Network and the potential for variations of level 2 to exist.</summary>
