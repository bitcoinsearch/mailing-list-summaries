    <summary>The discussion between Cezary and ZmnSCPxj revolves around opening Lightning Network (LN) channels and receiving payments without locking funds on the other side of the channel. They clarify that there is no way to communicate with the other party to ask them to commit money into channels when opening a channel due to trust issues, and suggest mitigating such issues by disallowing dual-funding by default on the node and requiring explicit permission for multi-funding from a particular peer. The "channel_reserve_satoshis" field is not for communicating with the other party but rather for setting the minimum amount of funds that must remain in the channel at all times.They discuss various options for receiving LN payments without locking funds, including early adoption, publishing node and contact details, waiting for services to offer deals, or asking a friend to channel to you. To establish a balanced channel for new businesses like an ATM that needs to send and receive funds, ZmnSCPxj suggests having incoming 300mBTC from one hub and making an outgoing 300mBTC to another hub, or creating "circular superhubs" where small groups cooperate and each member opens channels with the other two members. ZmnSCPxj also discusses the risks involved in opening channels to few nodes compared to more nodes, and the difficulty of opening multiple channels with a single participant in c-lightning. LND can form multiple channels with peer LND, but currently, c-lightning daemon will reject the multiple channel attempt from LND. While there is an issue regarding both-side funding channels, priority is given to the implementation of payments. Overall, they discuss various ways to improve network connectivity and encourage more participation in the LN.</summary>
