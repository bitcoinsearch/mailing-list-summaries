    <summary>The Lightning Network provides better possibilities for channel rebalancing compared to Amiko Pay. While balancing channels by paying oneself is technically possible with c-lightning, there is currently no built-in support for this feature, and it may not be necessary to consider from a protocol point of view. The email conversation between Robert Olsson and ZmnSCPxj discusses the possibility of balancing channels in the Lightning Network. However, balancing channels may not necessarily be desirable depending on use cases.In a conversation between Robert Olsson and Aleksej, Olsson suggests a function to avoid routing too much through certain channels, proposing an "automatically balance this channel to have at least X% of capacity" feature. Aleksej responds, suggesting that rebalancing could be done automatically when the user sends or receives transactions. He believes that typical users would have one channel for receiving funds and others for spending, and refunding could be done by spending funds through unbalanced channels in the direction where the user owns coins.Bob can balance his channels by paying himself an invoice of 1BTC, ensuring that the route goes out through Alice and comes back via Carol. Bob pays fees so that it does not disturb the other balances in the network. However, there is a risk that the entire network will start doing this and it will start oscillating. A hypothetical scenario proposed by Robert Olsson involves a function in the CLI allowing Bob to pay to himself and specify which two channels he would like to balance, either manually or automatically.Overall, while channel balancing is possible in the Lightning Network, it may not always be desirable depending on use cases. The protocol already supports solutions such as spending funds through unbalanced channels in the direction where the user owns coins. Automatic rebalancing could also be implemented when users send or receive transactions. However, caution must be taken regarding the risk of oscillation if everyone starts balancing their channels.</summary>
