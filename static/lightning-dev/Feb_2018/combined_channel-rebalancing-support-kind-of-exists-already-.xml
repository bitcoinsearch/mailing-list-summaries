    <summary>The email conversation between Robert Olsson and Aleksej discusses the need for rebalancing channels in the Lightning Network. Olsson suggests a hypothetical scenario where channels can be balanced by paying oneself an invoice of 1BTC and ensuring that the route goes out through one channel and comes back via another. He proposes adding a function in the CLI to allow users to pay themselves and specify which two channels they want to balance, and suggests making it automatic. Aleksej believes rebalancing may not be necessary as typical users would have separate channels for receiving funds and spending, and refunding could be done by spending funds through unbalanced channels. A developer commented on the technical possibility of balancing channels by paying oneself using c-lightning but pointed out that channel balance may not necessarily be desirable and depends on use cases. Another developer noted that once AMP is possible, this consideration will no longer be an issue. In the email conversation between Robert Olsson and ZmnSCPxj, the possibility of balancing channels in the Lightning Network is discussed. ZmnSCPxj notes that while it is technically possible, no implementation currently exists. Additionally, "balance" is not necessarily a desirable property for channels, as illustrated by an example where balancing channels would prevent Bob from paying a 1.5BTC invoice. However, once AMP is possible, this consideration will no longer be an issue. The email includes a hypothetical scenario in which Bob pays himself an invoice of 1BTC to balance his channels. Robert wonders if this functionality could be implemented automatically but expresses concern about the risk of oscillation if everyone starts doing it.Overall, rebalancing channels may be useful to reduce the risk of channel saturation at inconvenient moments, and the Lightning protocol allows for better possibilities in channel rebalancing compared to Amiko Pay. However, there is a risk of oscillation if everyone starts balancing their channels.</summary>
