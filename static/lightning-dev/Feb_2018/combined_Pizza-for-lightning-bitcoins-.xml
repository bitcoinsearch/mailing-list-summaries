    <summary>On February 24, 2018, Bitcoin enthusiast Laszlo Hanyecz successfully completed a Lightning Network trade using bitcoin to purchase pizza. To do this, he sub-contracted the delivery from a friend in London who acted as an intermediary. When the pizza delivery arrived, Laszlo paid the invoice and instantly received the preimage in return, which he presented to the driver to claim his pizza. In doing so, they demonstrated how everyday transactions could work on the network. ZmnSCPxj, a contributor to the Lightning Network, provided guidance on how Bitcoin can be used through the Lightning Network to pay for pizza. This involves creating a direct channel with the pizza provider, transferring the pizza price plus 546 satoshi to them and once delivered, the customer provides the preimage to the pizza provider via the LN protocol, confirming the transaction and releasing the pizza to the customer. The payment was made through an invoice system using the c-lightning platform. Although using the Lightning Network for small payments like this may not be practical yet, it offers an opportunity for experimentation and learning about the technology.In an email exchange on the Lightning-dev mailing list, a user named Laszlo shared a link to a website called "lightning pizza." Laszlo used the Lightning Network to purchase two pizzas from Papa John's, marking the first time the Lightning Network was used to make a real-world purchase. The Lightning Network allows for faster and cheaper transactions by creating payment channels between users. These channels allow for multiple transactions to occur without needing to be recorded on the blockchain. Instead, the channel balance is updated and then the final transaction can be settled on the blockchain.Laszlo's use of the Lightning Network to buy pizza showcases the potential benefits of this technology for everyday transactions. However, further development and adoption of the Lightning Network and other scaling solutions are needed for Bitcoin to become a more practical form of currency. Images of the family enjoying the pizza can be found at the link provided.</summary>
