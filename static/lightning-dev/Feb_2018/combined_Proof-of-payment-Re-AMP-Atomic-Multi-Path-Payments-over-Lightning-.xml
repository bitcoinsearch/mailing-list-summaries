    <summary>The Lightning-dev mailing list has discussed the use of Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payment (ZKCP) to provide a stronger proof-of-payment. This method involves creating a message indicating the payment amount and payee commitment, having the payee securely sign and encrypt it, and using the encryption key as the payment hash for a standard BOLT11. The encrypted message and signature are then provided to the payer through an end-to-end encrypted channel. To claim the payment on-Lightning, the payee provides the encryption key, which is propagated back to the payer by standard LN routing protocols. There is a debate around the reliability of the current invoicing system to prove payments. Some argue that a combination of signed invoice + preimage is not a reliable proof of payment. They suggest exploring proofs of stronger statements that could utilize ephemeral keys in onion packets or the onion as a witness. Additionally, proving that the payee received the correct amount of funds is more important than proving that the payer sent the funds. There have been suggestions for new invoice formats that may provide proof of payment and settle disputes cooperatively or through legal means.While the court is apparently the final point of settlement for invoices, the scripting language accepted by courts is quite flexible, and you can use that to enforce atomicity. In conclusion, while a proof of payment is an important feature to have, alternative methods that offer stronger statements should be explored. Furthermore, proving that the payee received the correct amount of funds is more important than proving that the payer sent the funds. There have been suggestions for new invoice formats that may provide proof of payment and settle disputes cooperatively or through legal means.</summary>
