    <summary>On the Lightning-dev mailing list, a proposal has been made to use Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payments (ZKCP) for providing stronger proofs-of-payment. This involves creating an encrypted message and signature of the payment amount and payee commitment that is then provided to the payer through an end-to-end encrypted channel. Only the payer can decrypt the message with the payment preimage, even if the preimage was propagated to multiple hops. This method can be used to prove payment to a specific party at a later date, including to a third party such as a court or tax authorities.There has been a recent discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list regarding proofs of payment in the Atomic Multipath Payments (AMP) setting. Some argue that a signed invoice + preimage is a reliable proof of payment, while others suggest exploring proofs of stronger statements that could utilize ephemeral keys in onion packets or the onion as a witness. They believe proving the payee received the correct amount of funds is more important than proving the payer sent the funds. There have been suggestions for new invoice formats that state the obligation of the signer to deliver Z if all corresponding payment keys are shown. In case of partial payment failure, the payer could sign a declaration stating which transactions were canceled and which ones should be refunded. The invoice format changes do not require changes to the network protocol.In conclusion, while a proof of payment is an important feature to have, the current signed invoice + preimage is not a reliable proof of payment. Alternative methods that offer stronger statements should be explored. Furthermore, proving that the payee received the correct amount of funds is more important than proving that the payer sent the funds. There have been suggestions for new invoice formats that may provide proof of payment and settle disputes cooperatively or through legal means. The court is apparently the final point of settlement for invoices, and the scripting language accepted by courts is quite flexible, which can be used to enforce atomicity.</summary>
