    <summary>Rusty Russell and Christian Decker, the developers of c-lightning, have granted commit access to ZmnSCPxj, a contributor who has earned their professional respect with over 100 commits, many of which were non-trivial. Despite knowing little about him other than his preferred pronoun and moniker, they are confident in his ability to provide excellent code and thorough review of their mistakes. ZmnSCPxj jokingly mentioned being on the side of humanity in the upcoming robot uprising, despite being randomly-generated human. Peter Todd responded to this announcement by suggesting that pseudonyms should use PGP signing for accountability and good code security practices should be followed. Rusty and Christian believe major developments are worth posting to the list and created an ML for c-lightning.</summary>
