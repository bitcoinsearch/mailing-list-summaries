    <summary>On February 23, 2018, Rusty Russell and Christian Decker announced that they have given ZmnSCPxj commit access to their project, c-lightning. Despite not knowing much about Zeeman except for his preferred pronoun and moniker, they have given him access due to the over 100 commits he has made, many of which were non-trivial. Zeeman has earned their professional respect with his contributions to the project. The developers are excited to see Zeeman's excellent code and thorough review of their mistakes now that he can share the blame.In response to this announcement, Peter Todd suggested that pseudonyms should use PGP signing commits for accountability and that good code security practices should be followed. Furthermore, Rusty and Christian believe that major developments are worth posting to the list and created an ML for c-lightning. Overall, ZmnSCPxj's access to c-lightning demonstrates the importance of contributing quality code to open source projects in order to earn the respect and trust of other developers.</summary>
