    <summary>The writer discusses the potential vulnerability of double-spending attacks in setting up new channels with untrusted parties. They propose a strategy to exploit this vulnerability by constructing multiple lightning channels and waiting for N confirmations before quickly routing payments to anonymous channels until they cannot send anymore. The author then publishes the doublespending fork, closing their original anonymous channels and gaining $X in funds available for the double spend. The capacity of the lightning network to route bitcoin is also discussed in relation to the cost of mounting a doublespend attack, which would require 1.4*25*M bitcoin to bribe 67% of hashpower for the time it would take to do 2*M blocks. If one can open 2000 channels per block, then X must be greater than 1.4*25*M/n.</summary>
