    <summary>In a series of email conversations between Rusty Russell, Btc Drak, Joseph Poon and Mats Jerratsch, various topics related to Lightning Network and OP_CSV were discussed. Btc Drak requested interested parties to review the OP_CSV BIP and pull request, as well as the "median-past-locktime" pull requests. There was also discussion about a feature-pack softfork which includes CLTV+CSV+BIP68+median_past_timelock as a single softfork. Joseph Poon and Mats Jerratsch discussed the possibility of using OP_CLTV without OP_CSV for a full Lightning Network and agreed that bitcoinj should have an implementation ready when OP_CLTV/OP_CSV is implemented. The Thunder proposal was also discussed, with its author suggesting the integration of OP_CLTV and CSV into the channel design to mitigate malleability problems. However, there were issues with HTLCs not being strictly revocable, which can be resolved using a simple reserve strategy. Settlement transactions not being time-encumbered was another issue that needed to be addressed.Mats Jerratsch analyzed the impact of OP_CLTV on the Thunder proposal and found that replacing CSV with CLTV is possible but has downsides. Rusty Russell expressed his hope that OP_CSV gets deployed soon to avoid future hacks and requested interested parties to review the relevant documents.</summary>
