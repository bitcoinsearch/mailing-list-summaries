    <summary>Mats Jerratsch and Joseph Poon discuss the possibility of implementing changes to the Thunder proposal, specifically the use of OP_CLTV without OP_CSV. Joseph had previously discussed this model on a mailing list with some caveats on the risks and effects of doing so. Mats works out how much is possible with only CLTV implemented and believes that very minor changes to the code would result in full lightning channels. The author of the Thunder proposal has discussed how to integrate OP_CLTV and CSV into the channel design to mitigate all malleability problems. Sending and receiving payments now consists of three outputs, combining the mechanism for refunds and revocable transactions with the ability of the receiver to claim payments if they know the secret R. There are issues with HTLCs not being strictly revocable, which can be resolved using a simple reserve strategy. Settlement transactions are not time-encumbered, which means one party can claim this payment under any circumstances. Rusty Russell sent an email expressing his hope that OP_CSV gets deployed soon to avoid future hacks. He also requested those interested in the topic to review the OP_CSV BIP, pull request and related BIP68 PR. Additionally, Btc Drak mentioned the idea of a feature-pack softfork which includes CLTV+CSV+BIP68+median_past_timelock as a single softfork. In an email conversation between Rusty Russell and Btc Drak, the deployment of OP_CSV was discussed as a means of avoiding hacks. Links to relevant documents were provided for review.</summary>
