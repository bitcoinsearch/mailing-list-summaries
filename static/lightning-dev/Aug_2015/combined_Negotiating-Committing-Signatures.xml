    <summary>The email exchange between Derek Atkins, Chief Technology Officer at SecureRF Corporation, and Rusty Russell revolves around the proposal of adding new types of signature schemes to Bitcoin and running lightning over multi-signature variants. Jeremy Rubin had previously suggested this hybrid approach to utilize the advantages of multiple signature schemes without drawbacks. The proposed scheme allows a user to switch from one signature scheme to another during settlements. SecureRF has developed a novel signature algorithm based on the Braid Group that promises to be significantly more efficient to verify. However, getting new crypto into Bitcoin is a large task, and it may be difficult to implement new signature algorithms. Rusty Russell responds that even with an increase in pubkey and signature sizes, it wouldn't make much logistical difference to the Lightning Network. But, using giant pubkeys could pose logistical issues, but using the Bitcoin trick of referring to them via their RIPEMD160 should work there too.Derek Atkins inquires about using AEDSA in a prototype and gauging its performance. He hopes to present his findings at the next Scaling Bitcoin workshop. Rusty Russell mentions that AEDSA signatures are around 6000 bits and not constant length, but there is a tremendous verification performance increase over ECDSA. Finally, Atkins provides his contact information and a confidentiality disclaimer at the end of the email.</summary>
