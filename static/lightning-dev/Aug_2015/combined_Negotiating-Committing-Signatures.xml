    <summary>In an email exchange, Derek Atkins, the Chief Technology Officer at SecureRF Corporation, inquires Rusty Russell about using AEDSA to create a prototype and gauge its performance. The goal is to present his findings at the next Scaling Bitcoin workshop. Derek asks whether he would need to change only within Lightning or also update bitcoind/alphad. Rusty responds by saying that while Bitcoin is interesting, Lightning is a box of pieces and therefore uninteresting.Jeremy Rubin proposed the addition of new types of signature schemes to Bitcoin and running lightning over multi-signature variants to make use of multiple signature schemes without drawbacks. This hybrid solution would be possible, but implementing novel crypto into Bitcoin is a large task. Rusty Russell responds that even with an "order of magnitude" increase in pubkey and signature sizes, it wouldn't make much logistical difference to the Lightning Network. However, giant pubkeys could pose logistical issues, but using the Bitcoin trick of referring to them via their RIPEMD160 should work there too.While the proposed scheme allows a user to use signature scheme B for the main set of negotiations and request switching to A when it's time to settle, the idea requires that new signature algorithms be added to Bitcoin, which may be difficult to implement. Currently, ECDSA is the only signature scheme available in Bitcoin, but there exist a multitude of signature schemes with many unique properties. SecureRF has developed a novel signature algorithm based on the Braid Group which promises to be significantly more efficient to verify. By lowering the requirements to verify a payment, embedded systems could be made less expensive that can verify a lightning network payment.Atkins reminds readers that his email may contain confidential, proprietary, and/or legally privileged information intended for authorized recipients only.
