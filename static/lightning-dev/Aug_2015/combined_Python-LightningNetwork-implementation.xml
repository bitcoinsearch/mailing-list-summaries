    <summary>Jasper Hugunin, a developer at HashPlex, has developed a prototype Lightning node in Python. The Lightning node is an off-chain scaling solution for Bitcoin that allows users to send and receive payments instantly. Jasper's version of the Lightning node includes features such as micropayment channels that support unilateral close and basic routing support allowing payment to be routed multiple hops. The node can send payment across multiple hops in the network but revocation and HTLCs have not yet been implemented. Routing also uses an insecure payment forwarding algorithm (since HTLCs are missing) and does not handle channels closing. Jasper has split the server, the UI, the channel protocol, and the routing protocol into separate modules so that they can be developed independently.The Lightning network has been gaining popularity among the Bitcoin community due to its potential to solve scalability issues, enable faster transactions, and reduce transaction fees. The release of this prototype node will further strengthen the Lightning network and provide developers with an opportunity to test and improve the technology. Joseph Poon expressed his excitement for the upcoming release.Jasper Hugunin explains the routing protocol used in a system which is a variant of distance-vector routing where nodes inform their peers about the cost to reach a particular node. This information is then used to create a routing table, which helps in forwarding payments to the desired recipient. However, the current protocol is not a final solution and just a demonstration of potential. Bryan Bishop raised questions regarding what would happen if the peer did not know the destination or if there were more than one peer involved.In an email chain dated August 12, 2015, Jasper Hugunin shared a repository link for Lightning routing with Bryan. The Lightning repository is shared by Jasper Hugunin and the routing protocol used in the repository is a variant of distance-vector routing. The email included an HTML attachment that was scrubbed of its URL.</summary>
