    <summary>In a discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, it was clarified that Lightning uses sequence numbers to achieve a relative lock-time. BIP 68 specifies a new consensus rule that allows the sequence number field to mandate a required minimum age for each input. This means that Lightning uses relative lock-times rather than an increment-on-each-transaction sequence number in the traditional sense. The sequence number field can be used to achieve a confirmation delay of a certain number of blocks after its parent block.Jeremy Rubin raised two questions regarding the use of sequence numbers in Lightning. Firstly, he asked about race conditions and how they are addressed with respect to blockchain height. Secondly, he questioned how using sequence numbers to select the right transaction to include could leak information about the number of LN transactions that took place, potentially making it meterable by external parties such as miners. He suggests incrementing by a random amount to alleviate reliable metering by external parties.Furthermore, Jorge Timón opines that the number inversion to "preserve the old nSequence semantics" is not worth it. It's less usable and harder to understand. Renaming nSequence to nMaturity and "check sequence verify" to "verify input maturity" may greatly simplify the documentation. However, he believes it may not be the right thread to repeat this.Lastly, the relative lock time (RCLTV) is used to prevent channels from automatically expiring, which would require new channels to be established periodically. The Lightning Network uses the sequence number field of the transaction format, but not as an increment-on-each-transaction sequence number in the traditional sense. Rather, BIP 68 specifies a new consensus rule by which the sequence number field can mandate a required minimum age for each input, thereby achieving a relative lock-time. Using sequence numbers to select the right transaction to include is good, but it would seem to leak information about how many LN transactions took place, which could then make it meterable by external parties.</summary>
