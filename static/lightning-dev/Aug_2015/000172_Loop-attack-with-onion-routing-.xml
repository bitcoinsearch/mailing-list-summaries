    <summary>On August 31, 2015, Rusty Russell shared an innovative scheme which involved returning a valid unilateral close transaction. If the recipient failed to comply, Rusty would close the channel and use that unilateral close to prevent his upstream from closing on him. According to Rusty, this approach had the right incentive as unilateral closes could prove to be costly in terms of locked funds, fees, and opportunity cost. While Rusty believed that they might need to get more sophisticated eventually, he thought it was sufficient for now. Anthony Towns concurred with Rusty's scheme and believed it was more than enough for their current needs.</summary>
