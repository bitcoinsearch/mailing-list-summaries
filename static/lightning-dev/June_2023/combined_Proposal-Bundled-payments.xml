    <title>Combined summary - Proposal: Bundled payments</title>

    <summary>Thomas Voegtlin has proposed an extension to BOLT-11, the Lightning Network protocol, that would allow invoices to contain two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts. This proposal is targeted at services like submarine swaps and JIT channels, which require a prepayment of a mining fee for a non-custodian exchange. The goal is to level the competition between lightning service providers and provide more flexibility in payment options.Currently, some services require a dedicated client software like Loop to enable prepayments. This puts competitors without a dedicated client at a disadvantage and exposes them to mining fee attacks. By adding this feature to BOLT-11, any wallet would be able to initiate reverse submarine swap payments and provide JIT channels without the need for a dedicated client.The proposal suggests that senders should be aware that the payment will lead to channel creation or a splice on the receiver end, and all existing software used by senders would need to be updated. Thomas proposes implementing this change in BOLT-12 rather than updating BOLT-11, as it could be deployed faster.Matt Corallo raises doubts about getting new interoperable changes into BOLT-11 and suggests exploring the use of onion messages (OMs) for swaps. However, Thomas believes that his proposal can be implemented in a non-interactive way without the need for new messages.There are discussions about whether this feature should be added to BOLT-11 or explored in other protocols like BOLT-12 or using onion messages. Thomas argues that adding new messages would unnecessarily complicate things and suggests implementing the change in BOLT-11.The proposal received positive feedback from Lightning Labs, ACINQ, and Electrum, as it aligns with their business models and regulatory compliance needs. However, there are concerns about the technical implementation and compatibility with existing protocols.Overall, Thomas's proposal aims to make Lightning Network services more accessible and competitive by allowing reverse submarine swap payments from any wallet and enabling JIT channels without the need for a dedicated client. The discussions revolve around the technical implementation of this feature and its compatibility with existing protocols. The decision to implement this change in BOLT-11 or explore other options remains a topic of discussion.Thomas Voegtlin has proposed an extension to BOLT-11, the Lightning Network protocol, which would allow invoices to contain two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts. This proposal is aimed at services that require a prepayment of a mining fee for non-custodian exchanges, such as Submarine swaps and JIT channels. The purpose of this change is to level the playing field in terms of competition between lightning service providers.Currently, using Loop, a dedicated client is required to make use of these services. Competitors without an established user base running a dedicated client are exposed to mining fee attacks. By implementing Thomas's proposal in BOLT-11, it would enable ACINQ to make their pay-to-open service fully non-custodian. The semantics of bundled payments would be that the invoice contains two preimages and two amounts: prepayment and main payment. The receiver would need to wait until all the HTLCs (Hashed Time-Locked Contracts) of both payments have arrived before fulfilling the HTLCs of the pre-payment. If the main payment does not arrive, they should fail the pre-payment with a MPP (Multi-Path Payment) timeout. Once the HTLCs of both payments have arrived, the receiver fulfills the HTLCs of the pre-payment and broadcasts their on-chain transaction.The decision to make this feature required or optional remains with the service provider. Matt Corallo responded to Thomas's proposal, stating that he believes it may be too late to add any new interoperable changes to BOLT-11. He suggests working towards specifying a "standard" way of doing swaps, potentially built on Onion Messages (OMs) for increased privacy. He also addresses Thomas's question about the distinction between splice-out and submarine swaps, explaining that submarine swaps allow for adding receiving capacity to a channel.In response to Thomas's inquiry about implementing bundled payments in BOLT-12, Bastien TEINTURIER notes that the proposal would require senders to be aware of the channel creation or splice on the receiver's end. This necessitates updating existing software used by senders. Bastien suggests that extending BOLT-12, which already requires new sender code, would make more sense than updating BOLT-11. He outlines three strategies for providing Just-In-Time (JIT) liquidity and discusses the advantages of the currently deployed strategies. He also proposes that pre-paying fees would make more sense if 0-conf (zero-confirmation) transactions are no longer used.Thomas responds to Matt's concerns about adding a new feature to BOLT-11, emphasizing that technical decisions should be based on technical needs. He believes that two major implementations, Lightning Labs and ACINQ, have an incentive to support this proposal. Thomas suggests that the feature could</summary>
