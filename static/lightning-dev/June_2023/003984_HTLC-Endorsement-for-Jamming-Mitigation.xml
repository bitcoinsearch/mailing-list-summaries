    <summary>In the conversation, Bob and Alice are discussing the HTLC endorsement system and its effectiveness in compensating for damage caused by jamming attacks. Bob explains that the amount of credit he gives to Alice's judgment determines whether he forwards or endorses her HTLC requests. He also mentions that the damage inflicted by Alice should be proportional to the revenue she recently generated for him, with a higher threshold for more damage.Alice expresses her concern about the economic compensation provided by the fees paid in the HTLC endorsement system. She questions whether the fees fully compensate for the damage caused to the victim or if it is a proportional compensation. If it is proportional, she wonders if the ratio between the fees and reputation is static or dynamic, and what criteria are used for evaluation.She notes that outlawing the cost of the attack from the system contradicts the goal of the HTLC endorsement design, which aims to impose a significant cost on persistent attackers. Alice also mentions that the "unjamming lightning" paper does not provide a formal definition of the problem or the correctness conditions required for a solution.Alice believes that there is an undervaluation of the liquidity griefing issues in Lightning and second-layers compared to the financial cryptography/computer security literature. She suggests evaluating the effectiveness of any jamming solution with the same conceptual rigor as modern cryptanalysis.She emphasizes the need for rigorous analysis to give measurable bounds to any solution and determine when there is a wreckage due to modifying parameters like channel opening default. She also mentions the possibility of adversaries having access to superior information for launching jamming attacks where the sum paid does not cover the operational cost.Alice clarifies that she does not claim to have done the "cryptoeconomics-analysis" work for her proposed solutions. However, she urges caution in deploying half-baked mitigations that could cause more harm than relief to routing node operators.In response to Clara's previous message, Alice brings up the issue of fluctuating link-level liquidity due to HTLC endorsement and suggests conducting simulations to assess the impact on HTLC routing traffic. She acknowledges that other proposed jamming solutions may also have downsides on routing traffic but believes that it is difficult to determine the trade-offs without further analysis.Overall, Alice highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of the problem being solved by any jamming mitigation and the importance of evaluating solutions with rigorous analysis and conceptual rigor.</summary>
