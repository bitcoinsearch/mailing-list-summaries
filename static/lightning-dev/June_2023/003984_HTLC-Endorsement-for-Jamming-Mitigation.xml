    <summary>In the conversation thread, Bob's ability to forward but not endorse Alice's HTLC is discussed. This ability is based on the credit Bob gives to Alice's judgment. In the case of jamming, the damage inflicted by Alice should be proportional to the revenue she recently generated for Bob. The more damage, the higher the threshold. The system described guarantees that if a node is jammed, it was paid a significant sum prior to the attack occurring. However, there is no mention of who is paying or the cost of the attack. It is questioned whether the fees paid fully compensate for the damage caused or if it is a proportional compensation. If it is proportional, it is unclear if the ratio between the fees and reputation is static or dynamic, and if dynamic, what the evaluation criteria are.The concern is raised that outlawing the cost of the attack goes against the goal of the proposed htlc endorsement system, which aims to have a significant cost for persistent attackers. The specific problem to be solved by the jamming mitigation and the required correctness conditions are also not clearly defined in the "unjamming lightning" paper.The liquidity griefing issues affecting Lightning and second-layers, including jamming, are considered novel from the perspective of financial cryptography/computer security literature. It is suggested that any jamming solution should be evaluated with the same rigor as modern cryptanalysis to provide measurable bounds and assess potential harm.In response to the discussion on HTLC endorsement potentially fluctuating link-level liquidity, it is suggested that simulations should be conducted to analyze how it may impact HTLC routing traffic. The trade-offs of other proposed jamming solutions on routing traffic success are also mentioned.Overall, caution is advised in deploying half-baked mitigations that could cause more harm than relief to routing node operators. The importance of rigorous analysis and evaluation in finding effective solutions is emphasized.</summary>
