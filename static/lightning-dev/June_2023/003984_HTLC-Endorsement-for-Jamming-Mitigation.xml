    <summary>The discussion revolves around the proposed HTLC endorsement system and its effectiveness in compensating for the damage inflicted by jamming attacks. One concern raised is whether the fees paid fully compensate for the damage or if it is proportional compensation. The ratio between fees and reputation is also questioned, specifically whether it is static or dynamic, and if dynamic, what criteria are used for evaluation.Another point of contention is the absence of a formal definition of the problem to be solved by any jamming mitigation system. The "unjamming lightning" paper claims to analyze the solution space but does not provide a formalized problem definition independent of the adopted solution.The liquidity griefing issues affecting Lightning and second-layers, including jamming, are considered novel from the perspective of financial cryptography/computer security literature. It is suggested that any jamming solution should be evaluated with the same conceptual rigor as modern cryptanalysis, using notions like Shannon cipher, perfect security, and the switching lemma.The potential impact of the HTLC endorsement system on HTLC routing traffic is discussed. It is acknowledged that the endorsement system can fluctuate link-level liquidity more than the current system, and simulations are suggested to assess the potential downgrade in HTLC routing traffic.Concerns are expressed about the trade-offs and downsides of other proposed jamming solutions on routing traffic success, although these trade-offs are difficult to determine without further analysis.Overall, caution is advised when deploying half-baked mitigations that may cause more harm than relief to routing node operators. The need for rigorous analysis and evaluation of any solution is emphasized to establish measurable bounds and avoid unintended consequences.The discussion also touches on the coupling effect between historical liquidity buckets of routing scoring algorithms and the introduction of the endorsement scheme. The reading on channel liquidity can vary for different users using different routes, but each node receives information about the liquidity available for them rather than the state of the channel in general. This fluctuation in liquidity is acknowledged but does not provide specific details on how it may impact the endorsement scheme.The conversation concludes without a resolution to the concerns raised, with further analysis and evaluation of proposed solutions being suggested.</summary>
