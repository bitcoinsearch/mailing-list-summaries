    <summary>The discussion revolves around the proposed HTLC endorsement system and its effectiveness in compensating for the damage caused by jamming attacks. The concern is raised that it is unclear whether the fees paid fully compensate for the inflicted damage or if it is a proportional compensation. It is also questioned if the ratio between fees and reputation is static or dynamic, and if dynamic, what criteria are used for evaluation.The cost of the attack is outlawed from the system, which seems contradictory to the goal of imposing a significant cost on persistent attackers. It is mentioned that the formal problem definition and correctness conditions required for a solution are not present in the "unjamming lightning" paper.There is a discussion about the undervaluation of liquidity griefing issues in Lightning and second-layers, of which jamming is just one aspect. It is suggested that the effectiveness of any jamming solution should be evaluated with the same rigor as modern cryptanalysis, considering notions like perfect security and switching lemma.The writer emphasizes the need for rigorous analysis to provide measurable bounds to any solution and to avoid unintended consequences. They express caution in deploying half-baked mitigations that could potentially harm routing node operators.The conversation also touches upon the fluctuation of link-level liquidity due to the proposed HTLC endorsement system and the potential impact on HTLC routing traffic. It is acknowledged that any proposed jamming solution would come with downsides on routing traffic success, but the trade-offs are difficult to determine.Overall, the discussion highlights the need for a comprehensive analysis of the problem and careful consideration of the potential consequences before implementing any solutions to address the issues of jamming attacks and liquidity griefing in Lightning.</summary>
