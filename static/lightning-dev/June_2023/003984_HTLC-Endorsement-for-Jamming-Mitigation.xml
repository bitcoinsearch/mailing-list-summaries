    <summary>Antoine expresses his concern about the lack of clarity regarding the compensation mechanism in the proposed HTLC endorsement system. He questions whether the fees paid fully compensate for the damage inflicted and asks if the ratio between fees and reputation is static or dynamic, and if dynamic, what criteria are used for evaluation.He also points out that outlawing the cost of the attack from the system seems to contradict the goal of the proposal, which is to have a significant cost for persistent attackers. Antoine suggests that the precise problem to be solved and the correctness conditions required for a solution are not clearly defined in the "unjamming lightning" paper.Antoine believes that the liquidity griefing issues affecting Lightning and second-layers, including jamming, are novel from the perspective of financial cryptography and computer security literature. He suggests that any jamming solution should be evaluated with the same conceptual rigor as modern cryptanalysis.Antoine emphasizes the importance of conducting rigorous analysis to give measurable bounds to any solution and to understand when there is a failure due to modifying parameters or adversaries accessing superior sources of information.Clara responds by discussing the coupling effect introduced between historical liquidity buckets of routing scoring algorithms and the introduction of the endorsement scheme. She mentions the LDK scoring engine comments that highlight the fluctuation of channel liquidity for different users using different routes.Overall, Antoine urges caution in deploying half-baked mitigations that could potentially cause more harm than relief to routing node operators. He emphasizes the need for thorough analysis and evaluation of any proposed solution to ensure its effectiveness and avoid unintended consequences.</summary>
