    <title>HTLC Endorsement for Jamming Mitigation</title>

    <summary>The email conversation discusses the proposed HTLC endorsement system for mitigating jamming attacks on Lightning Network routing nodes. The system requires a node to have been paid a significant fee sum by the peer originating the jamming traffic before an attack can occur, ensuring that the damage inflicted is proportional to the revenue created for the node. However, there is uncertainty about whether fees fully compensate for the damage or if compensation is proportional and dynamic based on evaluation criteria. The lack of formal problem definition and analysis of the liquidity griefing issues affecting Lightning and second-layers is noted, and caution is urged in deploying half-baked solutions that could cause more harm than relief to routing node operators. The coupling effect introduced between the historical liquidity buckets of routing scoring algorithms and the introduction of the endorsement scheme with adjustment of channel liquidity and slots in function of local topology reputation is also discussed. The reading on channel liquidity can change for different users using different routes, but the information a node gets is what liquidity is available for them, and this can fluctuate more than it does now, potentially downgrading HTLC routing traffic.</summary>
