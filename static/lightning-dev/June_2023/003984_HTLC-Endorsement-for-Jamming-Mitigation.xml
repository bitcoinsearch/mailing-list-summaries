    <summary>In a discussion about the proposed HTLC (Hashed Time-Locked Contract) endorsement system for mitigating jamming attacks in Lightning Network, several concerns and questions were raised. The first point of discussion was regarding the compensation mechanism in the event of a jamming attack. It was noted that the system guarantees that if a node was jammed, it was paid a significant sum prior to the attack happening. However, there is no information about who is paying or the cost of the attack. This raised doubts about whether the fees paid fully compensate for the damage inflicted on the victim or if it is a proportional compensation. If it is proportional, the ratio between the fees and reputation was questioned to be static or dynamic, and if dynamic, what are the criteria of evaluation.Another concern raised was the lack of formal definition and correctness conditions for the problem being solved by the jamming mitigation. The "unjamming lightning" paper was mentioned, which claims to systematically analyze the solution space but does not provide a formalized problem definition. The need for rigorous analysis and evaluation of any jamming solution was emphasized, comparing it to modern cryptanalysis in terms of conceptual rigor and understanding notions like perfect security and switching lemma.The liquidity griefing issues affecting Lightning and second-layers, including jamming, were highlighted as novel from the perspective of financial cryptography/computer security literature. It was suggested that the effectiveness of any jamming solution should be evaluated with the same level of rigor as modern cryptanalysis.The importance of simulations to understand how the proposed HTLC endorsement system might affect HTLC routing traffic was also mentioned. It was acknowledged that link-level liquidity may fluctuate more with this system, but the trade-offs and downsides on routing traffic success were not clear.Overall, caution was advised in deploying half-baked mitigations that could potentially cause more harm than relief to routing node operators. The need for thorough analysis and evaluation, as well as the consideration of trade-offs and downsides, was emphasized.The discussion also touched on the coupling effect introduced between historical liquidity buckets of routing scoring algorithms and the introduction of the endorsement scheme. A link to the LDK scoring engine comments was provided for further reference.In conclusion, the discussion highlighted concerns and questions regarding the compensation mechanism, formal definition and correctness conditions, rigorous analysis, evaluation, trade-offs, and downsides of the proposed HTLC endorsement system for jamming mitigation in Lightning Network. The need for caution in deploying solutions and the importance of simulations were emphasized.</summary>
