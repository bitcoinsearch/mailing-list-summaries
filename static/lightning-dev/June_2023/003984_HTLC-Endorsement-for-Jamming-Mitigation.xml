    <summary>In this email conversation, the issue of jamming attacks in Lightning and second-layers is discussed. The proposed solution involves a system that guarantees that if a node was jammed, it was paid a significant sum prior to the attack happening. However, it is unclear if the fees paid fully compensate for the damage inflicted on the victim or if the compensation is proportional. Additionally, there is a concern about the effectiveness of any jamming solution with the same conceptual rigor as modern cryptanalysis. It is noted that half-baked mitigations may cause more harm than relief to routing node operators. The conversation also touches on the HTLC endorsement model and how it introduces a coupling effect between the historical liquidity buckets of routing scoring algorithms and the introduction of endorsment scheme with adjustment of the channel liquidity and slots in function of local topology reputation. It is unclear how the compensation mechanism works in the chain of nodes that have high reputation with each other, and the HTLC endorsement mitigation suffers from the classic issues of reputation systems such as whitewashing. The reading on the channel liquidity can change for different users using different routes, but the information a node gets is what liquidity is available for them and not the state of the channel in general.</summary>
