    <summary>In the discussion, Bob's ability to forward but not endorse Alice's HTLC is mentioned. This decision depends on how much credit Bob gives to Alice's judgment. In the case of jamming, the damage inflicted by Alice should be proportional to the revenue she recently created for Bob. The more damage, the higher the threshold.The system guarantees that if a node was jammed, it was paid a significant sum prior to the attack happening. However, there is no claim about who is paying or the cost of the attack.There are concerns about the proposed HTLC endorsement system and whether the fees paid fully compensate for the damage inflicted. It is unclear whether the compensation is proportional and if so, whether the ratio between fees and reputation is static or dynamic. If dynamic, the criteria for evaluation are not specified.The concern is raised that outlawing the cost of the attack contradicts the goal of the HTLC endorsement design to have a significant cost to persistent attackers. The precise problem to be solved by any jamming mitigation and the correctness conditions required for a solution are not clearly defined in the "unjamming lightning" paper.The author emphasizes that the liquidity griefing issues affecting Lightning and second-layers, including jamming, are novel from the perspective of financial cryptography/computer security literature. They suggest evaluating the effectiveness of any jamming solution with the same rigor as modern cryptanalysis.Without a rigorous analysis, it may be difficult to set measurable bounds for any solution and determine when there is a wreckage due to modifying parameters like channel opening default. Additionally, adversaries may have access to superior sources of information for launching jamming attacks where the sum paid does not cover the operational cost of a routing hop.The author acknowledges that the reading on channel liquidity can change for different users using different routes. While this may fluctuate more with the introduction of the HTLC endorsement scheme, the information a node receives is limited to the liquidity available for them, not the general state of the channel.Overall, there are concerns about the compensation mechanism in the HTLC endorsement model, the lack of clarity on the problem being solved, and the need for rigorous analysis in evaluating jamming solutions.</summary>
