    <summary>Bob and Alice are discussing the proposed HTLC endorsement system, specifically regarding the compensation mechanism for damage inflicted by jamming attacks. Bob can choose to forward but not endorse Alice's HTLC, depending on his trust in her judgment. The damage inflicted by Alice should be proportional to the revenue she recently generated for Bob. However, it is unclear how the compensation mechanism works between nodes with high reputation. The system guarantees that if a node was jammed, it was paid a significant sum prior to the attack, but there is no information about who is paying or the cost of the attack.The discussion also brings up concerns about the lack of formal problem definition and correctness conditions for any jamming mitigation solution. While the "unjamming lightning" paper claims to systematically analyze the solution space, it does not provide a formalized problem definition independent of the adopted solution. The liquidity griefing issues affecting Lightning and second-layers, including jamming, are seen as novel from the perspective of financial cryptography/computer security literature. It is suggested that any jamming solution should be evaluated with the same conceptual rigor as modern cryptanalysis.Without a rigorous analysis, it may be difficult to set measurable bounds on any solution and determine when there is a wreckage due to modifying parameters or the adversaries' access to superior information. The author emphasizes caution in deploying half-baked mitigations that may cause more harm than relief to routing node operators.In response to Clara's point about fluctuating link-level liquidity with HTLC endorsement, it is suggested to simulate the potential downgrade of HTLC routing traffic caused by these fluctuations. The trade-offs and downsides of other proposed jamming solutions are considered difficult to determine intuitively and may require further investigation.Overall, the discussion highlights the need for a comprehensive analysis of jamming mitigation solutions, considering both the economic compensation for damage and the impact on routing traffic.</summary>
