    <title>HTLC Endorsement for Jamming Mitigation</title>

    <summary>The email conversation discusses the proposed HTLC endorsement system to address jamming attacks on Lightning and second-layers. The system requires a routing node to have been paid a significant fee sum by the peer originating the jamming traffic, with the damage inflicted proportional to the revenue recently created for the node. However, it is unclear whether the fees paid fully compensate for the damage or if the compensation ratio between the fees and reputation is static or dynamic. The lack of formal problem definition and correctness conditions required for a solution in the "unjamming lightning" paper raises concerns about evaluating any proposed solution's effectiveness rigorously. The email conversation also highlights the need to evaluate any proposed solution's downsides on routing traffic success and trade-offs carefully. Additionally, there are concerns about the coupling effect introduced between the historical liquidity buckets of routing scoring algorithms and the introduction of the endorsement scheme with adjustment of channel liquidity and slots based on local topology reputation. Despite this, the proposed system guarantees that a node has been paid a significant sum before an attack happens, and the information a node gets is what liquidity is available for them, not the state of the channel in general.</summary>
