    <title>HTLC Endorsement for Jamming Mitigation</title>

    <summary>The discussion revolves around the proposed HTLC endorsement system in the Lightning Network, specifically concerning the compensation mechanism and the impact on routing traffic. Bob, as a routing node, must make a decision when receiving an HTLC forwarding request from Alice. He can either refuse to forward the HTLC and lose potential fee income or accept it and risk damage if Alice is revealed as a jamming attacker later on. The extent of the damage should be proportional to the revenue Alice created for Bob. However, the details of how the compensation mechanism works in the chain of nodes with high reputation are unclear.There is concern about the coupling effect between historical liquidity buckets of routing scoring algorithms and the introduction of the endorsement scheme. The adjustment of channel liquidity and slots based on local topology reputation introduces complexity. The reading on channel liquidity can vary for different users and routes, potentially leading to fluctuations. While this may affect link-level liquidity, the information available to a node is still about the liquidity specific to them, not the general state of the channel.The discussion also emphasizes the need for rigorous analysis and evaluation of any jamming solution. It is suggested that the effectiveness of such solutions should be evaluated with the same conceptual rigor as modern cryptanalysis. Without proper analysis, measurable bounds cannot be established, and there is a risk of deploying half-baked mitigations that may cause more harm than relief to routing node operators.Overall, there are concerns about the compensation mechanism, the impact on routing traffic, and the need for thorough analysis in deploying jamming mitigations in the Lightning Network.</summary>
