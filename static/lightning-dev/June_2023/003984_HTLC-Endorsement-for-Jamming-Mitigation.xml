    <summary>In this communication, there is a discussion about the proposed HTLC (Hashed Time-Lock Contract) endorsement system and its effectiveness in compensating for damages caused by jamming attacks. The question raised is whether the fees paid through the endorsement system fully compensate for the damage inflicted on the victim or if it is only proportional compensation. It is also unclear if the ratio between fees and reputation is static or dynamic, and if dynamic, what criteria are used for evaluation.The concern is expressed that outlawing the cost of the attack from the system contradicts the design goal of imposing a significant cost on persistent attackers. The precise problem to be solved by any jamming mitigation and the correctness conditions required for a solution are not clearly defined in the "unjamming lightning" paper, which claims to systematically analyze the solution space but lacks a formalized problem definition.The author emphasizes the need for a rigorous analysis of the liquidity griefing issues affecting Lightning and second-layers, including jamming attacks, using conceptual rigor similar to modern cryptanalysis. Without such analysis, it is difficult to set measurable bounds for any solution and determine when there is a failure due to subtle parameters or superior sources of information available to attackers.While acknowledging that the proposed HTLC endorsement system may fluctuate link-level liquidity more than it does now, the author suggests conducting simulations to assess the potential downgrade of HTLC routing traffic. It is noted that other proposed jamming solutions might also have downsides on routing traffic success, although the trade-offs are hard to determine.In another part of the communication, the coupling effect between historical liquidity buckets and the introduction of endorsement schemes with adjustments of channel liquidity and slots based on local topology reputation is mentioned. A link to the LDK scoring engine comments is provided for further reference.Overall, the discussion highlights the need for careful consideration and evaluation of potential mitigations for jamming attacks in order to avoid causing more harm than relief to routing node operators.</summary>
