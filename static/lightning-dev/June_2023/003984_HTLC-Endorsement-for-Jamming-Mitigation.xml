    <summary>In the discussion, Bob's ability to forward but not endorse Alice's HTLC is mentioned. This ability is determined by the amount of credit Bob gives to Alice's judgment. In the event of an attack, the damage inflicted by Alice should be proportional to the revenue she has recently generated for Bob. Therefore, the more damage, the higher the threshold.The system guarantees that if a node is jammed, it was paid a significant sum prior to the attack occurring. However, there is no information about who is paying or the cost of the attack.There seems to be some uncertainty regarding whether the fees paid fully compensate for the damage caused by the endorsement system. It is unclear if the compensation is proportional, and if so, whether the ratio between the fees and reputation is static or dynamic. If dynamic, the criteria for evaluation are not specified.Outlawing the cost of the attack from the system contradicts the goal of the htlc endorsement design, which is to have a significant cost to persistent attackers. The specific problem to be solved by any jamming mitigation, as well as the correctness conditions required for a solution, are not clearly defined in the "unjamming lightning" paper.The liquidity griefing issues affecting Lightning and second-layers, including jamming, are considered novel in terms of financial cryptography/computer security literature. To evaluate the effectiveness of any jamming solution, it is suggested that the conceptual rigor used in modern cryptanalysis, such as notions like shannon cipher, perfect security, and switching lemma, should be applied.Without a rigorous analysis, it is difficult to set measurable bounds for any solution and determine when there is a failure due to modifying parameters like channel opening default or adversaries having access to superior sources of information for launching a jamming attack that is not economically viable for routing hops.It is emphasized that caution should be exercised in deploying half-baked mitigations that may cause more harm than relief to routing node operators. It is suggested that simulations should be conducted to evaluate how the htlc endorsement system may affect HTLC routing traffic and what trade-offs may be involved.In terms of the coupling effect introduced between historical liquidity buckets of routing scoring algorithms and the introduction of the endorsement scheme, there is a concern about the adjustment of channel liquidity and slots based on local topology reputation. The reading on channel liquidity can vary for different users using different routes, but the information obtained by a node is limited to the liquidity available to them, not the overall state of the channel. This fluctuation in liquidity may impact HTLC routing traffic.Overall, the discussion highlights the need for a formal definition of the problem to be solved by jamming mitigation and the importance of conducting rigorous analysis to evaluate proposed solutions. It also emphasizes the potential risks and downsides associated with deploying mitigations without thorough evaluation.</summary>
