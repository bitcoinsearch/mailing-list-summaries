    <summary>The discussion begins with Bob's ability to forward but not endorse Alice's HTLC, which is based on how much credit Bob gives to Alice's judgment. The damage inflicted by Alice in case of jamming should be proportional to the revenue she recently created for Bob. This system ensures that if a node is jammed, it was paid a significant sum prior to the attack, without specifying who is paying or the cost of the attack.The sender raises concerns about the economic compensation for the damage inflicted by the proposed HTLC endorsement system. They question whether the fees paid fully compensate for the damage and if the compensation is proportional or static/dynamic. They also inquire about the design goals of the proposed solution and suggest the need for formal problem definition and correctness conditions.The sender emphasizes the importance of rigorous analysis, comparable to modern cryptanalysis, in evaluating the effectiveness of any jamming solution. They believe that without such analysis, it would be difficult to measure the bounds of a solution or determine when there is a wreckage due to modifications in parameters or superior sources of information available to adversaries.The sender acknowledges that the liquidity griefing issues affecting Lightning and second-layers, including jamming, are novel in financial cryptography/computer security literature. They argue for caution in deploying half-baked mitigations that may cause more harm than relief to routing node operators.The sender requests simulations to understand the potential downgrade of HTLC routing traffic caused by the fluctuations introduced by HTLC endorsement. They also mention the trade-offs associated with other proposed jamming solutions.In response, Clara discusses the distinction between routing fees and reputation revenue in the HTLC endorsement model. She presents an example scenario involving Caroll and Bob, where Bob's decision to accept or refuse Alice's HTLC forwarding request depends on the reputation revenue created for Bob and the potential damage if Alice is a jamming attacker.Clara mentions the coupling effect between historical liquidity buckets of routing scoring algorithms and the introduction of the endorsement scheme. She provides a link to the LDK scoring engine comments for further reference.Clara clarifies that while the reading on channel liquidity can change for different users using different routes, the information a node receives pertains to the liquidity available for them specifically, rather than the general state of the channel.Overall, the discussion revolves around the economic compensation, design goals, formal problem definition, and analysis rigor of the proposed HTLC endorsement system, as well as the potential impact on routing traffic and the need for caution in deploying mitigations.</summary>
