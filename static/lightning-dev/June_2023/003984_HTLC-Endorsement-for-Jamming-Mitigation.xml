    <summary>The context of the conversation is related to the proposed HTLC endorsement system, which aims to mitigate jamming attacks in Lightning Network. The discussion highlights the need for a formal definition of the problem and correctness conditions required for the solution. The proposed system guarantees that if a node was jammed, it was paid a significant sum prior to the attack happening. However, the compensation mechanism in the chain of nodes with high reputation is still unclear. There is also a coupling effect introduced between the historical liquidity buckets of routing scoring algorithms and the introduction of endorsement schemes with adjustments of the channel liquidity and slots in function of local topology reputation. The reading on the channel liquidity can change for different users using different routes, but the information a node gets is what liquidity is available for them (and not the state of the channel in general).</summary>
