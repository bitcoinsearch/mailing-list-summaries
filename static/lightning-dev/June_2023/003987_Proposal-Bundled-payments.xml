    <summary>In a conversation between Thomas Voegtlin and David A. Harding, they discuss the idea of bundling payments in BOLT11 invoices to save space for the prepayment hash. Thomas suggests that the invoice would still need a feature bit to make the prepayment optional or required. He explains that for the feature to be optional, the prepayment amount should be subtracted from the main payment amount. Thomas provides an example where Alice would expect to receive either 1 BTC with the invoice payment hash or 1 BTC minus 10k sats with the invoice payment hash, along with 10k sats sent via keysend with the prepayment hash.David asks if it is necessary for the BOLT11 invoice to contain a payment hash for the prepayment or if it would be acceptable to use a keysend payment with metadata indicating the payment hash to associate with the prepayment. He suggests extending BOLT11 invoices with an extra_fee_via_keysend field, which would be smaller and could be encoded in existing BOLT11 fields like the description or metadata field. This would allow for immediate implementation until an updated version of BOLT11 or an alternative using offers becomes widely deployed.The conversation ends with Thomas' signature and contact information.</summary>
