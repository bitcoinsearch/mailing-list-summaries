    <summary>Thomas and David are discussing the semantics of bundled payments. Thomas suggests that an invoice would need a feature bit for the receiver to decide whether prepayment is optional or required. For the feature to be optional, the prepayment amount should be subtracted from the main payment amount. The invoice would either contain the 1 BTC invoice payment hash or (1 BTC - minus 10k sats, invoice payment_hash) + (10k sats, prepayment_hash via keysend). David asks if it's necessary for a BOLT11 invoice to contain a payment hash for the prepayment or if it would be acceptable for the prepayment to use a keysend payment with metadata indicating what payment hash to associate with the prepayment. He suggests adding an extra_fee_via_keysend field to BOLT11 invoices, which would be significantly smaller and allow encoding the field in an existing BOLT11 field like (d) description or (m) metadata field. Electrum Technologies GmbH, located in Berlin, Germany, provides the email communication platform for the discussion.</summary>
