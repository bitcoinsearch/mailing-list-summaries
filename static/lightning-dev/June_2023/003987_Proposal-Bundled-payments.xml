    <summary>In the email exchange between Thomas Voegtlin and David A. Harding, they discuss the idea of bundling payments in BOLT11 invoices. Thomas suggests that the invoice should have a feature bit to allow the receiver to make prepayment optional or required. He explains that if the feature is optional, the prepayment amount should be subtracted from the main payment amount. For example, if Alice expects to receive 1 BTC, she would either receive (1 BTC, invoice payment_hash) or (1 BTC - minus 10k sats, invoice payment_hash) + (10k sats, prepayment_hash via keysend).David responds with a question about whether it is necessary for a BOLT11 invoice to contain a payment hash for the prepayment, or if it would be acceptable for the prepayment to use a keysend payment with metadata indicating the payment hash to associate with the prepayment. He suggests extending BOLT11 invoices with an extra_fee_via_keysend field, which would be smaller and could be encoded in existing fields like description or metadata.Overall, the discussion revolves around the technical implementation of bundled payments in BOLT11 invoices, specifically focusing on the inclusion of prepayment options and the use of keysend payments.</summary>
