    <summary>In an email exchange between Thomas Voegtlin and David A. Harding, they discuss the concept of bundled payments and the need for a feature bit in invoices to make prepayment optional or required. Voegtlin suggests subtracting the prepayment amount from the main payment amount for optional prepayment. He provides an example where Alice would expect to receive either 1 BTC with the invoice payment hash or 1 BTC minus 10k sats with the invoice payment hash, along with 10k sats sent via keysend as a prepayment.Harding responds by questioning whether a BOLT11 invoice needs to contain a payment hash for the prepayment or if it would be acceptable to use a keysend payment with metadata indicating the payment hash. He proposes extending BOLT11 invoices with an extra_fee_via_keysend field, which could be encoded in existing BOLT11 fields like description or metadata.Overall, the email exchange explores the details and potential implementation of bundled payments and the necessary modifications to invoicing systems.</summary>
