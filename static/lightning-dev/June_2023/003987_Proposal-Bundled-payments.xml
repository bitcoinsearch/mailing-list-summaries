    <summary>In a discussion between David A. Harding and Thomas Voegtlin on 19.06.23, they talk about the semantics of bundled payments where the BOLT-11 invoice contains two preimages and two amounts: prepayment and main payment. The receiver should wait until all the HTLCs of both payments have arrived before fulfilling the HTLCs of the pre-payment. Once the HTLCs of both payments have arrived, the receiver fulfills the HTLCs of the prepayment, and they broadcast their on-chain transaction. David asks if it is necessary for a BOLT11 invoice to contain a payment hash for the prepayment or would it be acceptable for the prepayment to use a keysend payment with the onion message payload for the receiver indicating what payment hash to associate with the prepayment. He suggests that it would allow encoding the extra_fee_via_keysend field in an existing BOLT11 field like (d) description or the relatively new (m) metadata field, which may allow immediate implementation until an updated version of BOLT11 becomes widely deployed. Thomas agrees that it's an interesting idea and thinks adding an extra_fee_via_keysend field to BOLT11 invoices would be significantly smaller. However, he notes that the invoice would still need a feature bit so that the receiver can decide to make prepayment optional or required. For the feature to be optional, the prepayment amount needs to be subtracted from the main payment amount.</summary>
