    <summary>Dave and Thomas are discussing the idea of implementing a feature where an invoice can have a prepayment option. Dave suggests using a keysend payment with the onion message payload to indicate what payment hash should be associated with the prepayment. This would eliminate the need for the prepayment to be included in the BOLT11 invoice. Thomas agrees with the idea and mentions that if the feature is optional, the prepayment amount should be subtracted from the main payment amount. In an example scenario, Alice would expect to receive either 1 BTC with the invoice payment hash or 1 BTC minus 10k sats with the invoice payment hash, along with 10k sats via keysend with the prepayment hash. Dave suggests extending the BOLT11 invoices with an extra_fee_via_keysend field, which would be smaller and could be encoded in existing fields like the description or metadata field. This would allow for immediate implementation until an updated version of BOLT11 or an alternative using offers becomes widely deployed.</summary>
