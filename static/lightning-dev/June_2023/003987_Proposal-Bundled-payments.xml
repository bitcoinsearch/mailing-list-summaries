    <summary>In an email exchange between Thomas Voegtlin and David A. Harding, they discuss the idea of saving space for the prepayment hash. Thomas suggests adding a feature bit to the invoice to allow the receiver to decide if prepayment is optional or required. He explains that if the feature is optional, the prepayment amount should be subtracted from the main payment amount. In an example provided, Alice would expect to receive either 1 BTC with the invoice payment hash, or 1 BTC minus 10k sats with the invoice payment hash plus 10k sats with the prepayment hash via keysend.David then asks if it is necessary for a BOLT11 invoice to contain a payment hash for the prepayment, or if it would be acceptable to use a keysend payment with metadata indicating the payment hash associated with the prepayment. He suggests extending BOLT11 invoices with an extra_fee_via_keysend field, which would be smaller and allows encoding in existing fields like the description or metadata field. This would allow immediate implementation until an updated version of BOLT11 or an alternative using offers becomes widely deployed.The email exchange took place between Thomas Voegtlin and David A. Harding, who are affiliated with Electrum Technologies GmbH, located in Berlin, Germany.</summary>
