    <summary>In an email exchange between Dave and Thomas, they discuss the semantics and requirements of bundled payments. Thomas suggests that for the feature to be optional, the prepayment amount should be subtracted from the main payment amount. He provides an example where Alice would expect to receive either 1 BTC with the invoice payment hash or 1 BTC minus 10k sats with the invoice payment hash along with 10k sats via prepayment hash through keysend.Dave raises a question about whether a BOLT11 invoice is necessary to contain a payment hash for the prepayment or if it would be acceptable to use a keysend payment with the onion message payload indicating the payment hash associated with the prepayment. He suggests extending the BOLT11 invoices with an extra_fee_via_keysend field, which would be smaller and could be encoded in existing fields like description or metadata.This email exchange took place between Electrum Technologies GmbH, with Thomas Voegtlin as the CEO, and Dave A. Harding.</summary>
