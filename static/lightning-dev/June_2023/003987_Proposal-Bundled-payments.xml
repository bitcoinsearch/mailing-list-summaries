    <summary>In an email exchange between Thomas Voegtlin and David A. Harding, they discuss the semantics of bundled payments in relation to BOLT-11 invoices. Voegtlin suggests that for the feature to be optional, the prepayment amount needs to be subtracted from the main payment amount. He gives an example where Alice would expect to receive either 1 BTC with the invoice payment hash or 1 BTC minus 10k sats with the invoice payment hash plus 10k sats with the prepayment hash via keysend. Harding then asks if it would be acceptable for the prepayment to use a keysend payment with the onion message payload indicating what payment hash to associate with the prepayment. He proposes extending BOLT11 invoices with an extra_fee_via_keysend field, which could be encoded in existing BOLT11 fields like (d) description or (m) metadata. This would provide a smaller solution that can be implemented immediately until an updated version of BOLT11 or an alternative using offers becomes widely deployed.</summary>
