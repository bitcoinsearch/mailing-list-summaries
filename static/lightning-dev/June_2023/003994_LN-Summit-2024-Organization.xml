    <summary>Antoine is proposing to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlights several reasons why Africa would be a great location for the summit, including its natural beauty, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that could benefit from a compatible payment protocol, and a growing number of Lightning developers coming from the continent. Antoine acknowledges that typically, the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit is not announced on open communication channels to maintain serenity in engineering conversations and avoid trolling. However, due to the expected operational challenges such as visa travels and tropical weather, Antoine believes it is better to announce the summit far in advance. He expresses the need for a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the process.Antoine invites feedback and objections to his proposal for organizing the LN Summit 2024. He emphasizes his commitment to transparency and accountability in setting standards. He encourages starting small by surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that could serve as potential locations for the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, and more. Antoine plans to privately share the feedback with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics. He provides a dedicated communication endpoint, lnsummit2024 at ariard.me, for those interested in being part of the organization and sees it as an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.Antoine mentions his previous experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, which gives him operational templates for the LN Summit organization.</summary>
