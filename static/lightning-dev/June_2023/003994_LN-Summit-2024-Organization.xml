    <summary>Antoine, a Lightning developer, has proposed to organize the Lightning Network (LN) Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes that Africa is a beautiful continent with a rich cultural and historical past, but its financial systems are fragmented, which can be solved with a compatible payment protocol like LN. Additionally, there is an explosive demography with many Lightning developers coming from Africa, and there are formidable perspectives to grow "full-stack" local Lightning economies.Antoine acknowledges that usually, the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit is not announced on open communication channels to maintain serenity of the engineering conversation and avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, he feels that operational challenges for organizing the event in Africa may be more complex and need to be announced far ahead. Antoine hopes for a multi-stakeholder approach with "skin in the game" from various individuals to guarantee fairness and transparency of the process.To start small, Antoine plans to survey all the countries in Africa with reasonable operational stability that can fit the location for the summit. He will share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics by the end of summer. Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint for this purpose and invites LN devs to reach out if they want to be part of the organization. The summit's operations and financial resources should be okay, but additional support would be helpful.In conclusion, Antoine proposes to organize the LN Summit in Africa in 2024 due to several reasons, including the continent's beauty, rich culture and history, fragmented financial systems, explosive demography, and growing number of Lightning developers. He hopes for a multi-stakeholder approach and promises to set strong transparency and accountability standards.</summary>
