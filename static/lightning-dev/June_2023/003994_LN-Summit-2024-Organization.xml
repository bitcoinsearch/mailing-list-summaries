    <summary>Antoine, a Lightning Network developer, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlights several reasons for choosing Africa as the location, including its cultural and historical significance, financial system fragmentation that can be resolved with a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and the potential for local Lightning economies to thrive.Antoine acknowledges that it is uncommon to announce the organization of events like CoreDev or LN Summit on public channels due to the desire for an engineering-focused conversation and to avoid unwanted attention. However, given the potential complexities involved in organizing the summit in Africa, such as visa travels and "tropical weather," he believes it is better to announce it well in advance. While operations and financial resources are expected to be sufficient, Antoine suggests a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency throughout the process.Antoine welcomes any objections or concerns regarding his involvement in organizing the LN Summit 2024 and encourages people to provide feedback publicly or privately. He emphasizes his commitment to strong transparency and accountability standards, highlighting the importance of actions over words in the open-source community.To start the project, Antoine proposes surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that could serve as potential locations for the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He plans to privately share the feedback based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics with Lightning attendees towards the end of summer.Antoine provides a dedicated communication endpoint, lnsummit2024@ariard.me, for anyone interested in being part of the organization or transferring knowledge between generations of contributors.Antoine concludes by mentioning that he has previous experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021 and therefore already has operational templates in place.</summary>
