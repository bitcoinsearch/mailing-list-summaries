    <summary>Antoine, a Lightning Network developer, is proposing to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes that Africa is an ideal location for the summit due to its rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that could benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a young and energetic population, and the increasing number of Lightning developers from the continent.Antoine acknowledges that the organization of such an event should not be announced on open communication channels to maintain serenity in engineering conversations and avoid trolling. However, he recognizes that the operational challenges involved in hosting the summit in Africa, such as visas and tropical weather, require advanced planning. He suggests announcing the event well in advance to allow for ample preparation time.While Antoine believes that the necessary operational and financial resources are available, he encourages a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the process. He welcomes objections or feedback regarding his involvement in organizing the LN Summit 2024.To kickstart the project, Antoine plans to survey countries with reasonable operational stability that could serve as suitable locations for the summit, including Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, and others. He will share the results privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics.Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint at lnsummit2024@ariard.me for anyone interested in being part of the organization. He sees this as an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of Lightning Network contributors.Antoine concludes his message by mentioning that he has previously co-organized the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021 and already has operational templates in place.</summary>
