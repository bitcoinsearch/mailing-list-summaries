    <summary>Antoine, a Lightning developer, has proposed to organize the Lightning Network (LN) Summit in Africa in June 2024. He points out that Africa is a continent with a rich cultural and historical past, a fragmented financial system, a large and energetic population, and increasing numbers of Lightning developers. While normally such events are not announced on open communication channels to maintain engineering conversation's serenity, Antoine believes that announcing it ahead of time is necessary due to operational challenges such as visa travel and tropical weather. Antoine assures that the operational and financial resources for the event should be okay, but multi-stakeholder involvement would be preferable for fairness and transparency. He sets up a dedicated communication endpoint for the event and invites LN developers to reach out and join the organization team to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors. The first step is to survey countries with reasonable operational stability that can fit the location, including Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, etc. Antoine plans to share his feedback on this privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics at the end of the summer.</summary>
