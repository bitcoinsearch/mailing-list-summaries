    <summary>Antoine, a Lightning Network (LN) developer, is proposing to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlights several reasons for choosing Africa as the location, including its rich cultural and historical past, fragmentation in the financial systems of the 56 states that can be addressed with a compatible payment protocol, and the potential for "full-stack" local Lightning economies. The announcement is being made earlier than usual due to the operational challenges involved in organizing an event in Africa, such as visa travel and tropical weather.To ensure fairness and transparency, Antoine suggests a multi-stakeholder approach with various individuals contributing their "skin in the game." He encourages anyone who objects to his involvement in organizing the summit to voice their concerns publicly or privately.Antoine plans to start small by surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that could serve as potential locations for the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He will share his findings privately with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics.Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint for the LN Summit 2024 at lnsummit2024@ariard.me. LN developers are encouraged to reach out if they want to be part of the organization, as it presents an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.Antoine mentions that he previously co-organized the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, indicating that he already has operational templates in place for organizing such events.</summary>
