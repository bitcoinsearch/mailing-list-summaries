    <summary>Antoine, a Lightning developer, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes there are several reasons to hold the summit in Africa, including its beautiful continent, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that can be solved with a compatible payment protocol, an energetic demography, and an increasing number of Lightning developers from the continent. Antoine acknowledges that the organization of such events is usually not announced on open communication channels for engineering conversation serenity and to avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, due to potential operational challenges like visa travels and tropical weather, Antoine suggests announcing it ahead of time. He also mentions that operations and financial resources should be sufficient, but a multi-stakeholder approach would ensure fairness and transparency.Antoine invites anyone with objections to his contribution to let him know in the coming weeks, either publicly or privately. He emphasizes his commitment to transparency and accountability. To start small, Antoine plans to survey countries with reasonable operational stability that could serve as the location for the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He will share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics at the end of the summer. Antoine provides a dedicated communication endpoint, lnsummit2024@ariard.me, for further discussions and encourages Lightning developers to reach out and participate in the organization as an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors. He concludes by mentioning his previous experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, which provides him with operational templates.</summary>
