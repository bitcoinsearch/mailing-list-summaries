    <summary>Antoine, a Lightning developer, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlights several reasons why Africa would be an ideal location for the summit, including its beauty, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that could benefit from a compatible payment protocol, and the growing number of Lightning developers in the continent. Antoine acknowledges that the announcement of such events is typically not made on open communication channels to maintain serenity in engineering conversations and avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, due to the potential operational challenges involved in organizing the summit in Africa, he believes it is better to announce it well in advance.Antoine mentions that operations and financial resources should be sufficient for the event but suggests a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency. If anyone objects to his contribution to the organization of the LN Summit 2024, he encourages them to voice their concerns publicly, privately, or on the thread. Antoine emphasizes his commitment to maintaining strong transparency and accountability standards, believing that actions speak louder than words in the open-source community.To start the project, Antoine plans to survey countries with reasonable operational stability that could serve as potential locations for the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He intends to share this feedback privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics. Additionally, Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint (lnsummit2024@ariard.me) for further discussions and organization.Antoine invites Lightning developers to join the organization of the summit as an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors. He concludes his message by expressing his readiness for the task, having already co-organized the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021 and possessing operational templates for reference.</summary>
