    <summary>Antoine is proposing to organize the Lightning Network (LN) Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlights several reasons for choosing Africa as the location, including its beauty, rich cultural and historical past, financial system fragmentation that can be solved with a compatible payment protocol, and an energetic demography. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of Lightning developers coming from Africa, which presents opportunities for growing local Lightning economies.Antoine acknowledges that it is not usual to announce the organization of events like CoreDev or LN Summit on open communication channels due to the desire for a serene engineering conversation and to avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, given the potential operational complexities, such as visa travels and tropical weather, Antoine believes it is better to announce the summit far ahead. He also suggests that a multi-stakeholder approach with "skin in the game" would ensure fairness and transparency throughout the process.Antoine invites any objections to his contribution to the organization of LN Summit 2024 and requests feedback in the coming weeks, either publicly or privately. He emphasizes his commitment to setting strong transparency and accountability standards, emphasizing that actions speak louder than words in the open-source community.To begin the project, Antoine advises starting small by surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that could serve as potential locations for the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, among others. He plans to share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics.Antoine provides a dedicated communication endpoint, lnsummit2024@ariard.me, for anyone interested in being part of the organization, particularly Lightning Network developers who see this as an opportunity to transfer knowledge between different generations of contributors. He concludes the message with a cheerful sign-off.It's worth noting that Antoine mentions having co-organized the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, indicating that he already has operational templates for organizing such events.</summary>
