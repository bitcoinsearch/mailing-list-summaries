    <summary>The discussion revolves around the compensation for routing nodes in case of an attack and the need for a formal problem definition and rigorous analysis of jamming mitigation solutions in the Lightning Network. The first concern raised is whether the fees paid to routing nodes fully compensate for the damage caused by jamming traffic. It is suggested that different thresholds can be set based on node preferences, providing suggestions for receiving nodes.The question of whether the compensation is proportional and if so, whether the ratio between fees and reputation is static or dynamic is also raised. It is mentioned that the difficulty of gaining reputation is proportional to the amount of damage inflicted. Outlawing the cost of the attack from the system is considered contrary to the goal of imposing a significant cost on persistent attackers, with the focus being on compensating the victim.The lack of a precise problem definition and correctness conditions for a solution is highlighted, stating that such information is not present in the "unjamming lightning" paper. The author suggests the need for a rigorous evaluation of jamming solutions, comparable to modern cryptanalysis, to provide measurable bounds and detect any potential operational cost gaps in the compensation.Due to the subjective nature of certain criteria like user experience and ease of implementation, it is acknowledged that proving theorems may not be possible. However, simulations are being conducted to assess quantifiable criteria and bridge the gap between theory and practice. The difficulty of mitigating DDoS attacks is mentioned, emphasizing the effort to utilize available tools within the Lightning Network context.Finally, the request is made for simulations to examine how HTLC endorsement might impact HTLC routing traffic, considering its potential effect on link-level liquidity.Overall, the discussion highlights the importance of addressing the compensation issue for routing nodes and the need for a formal problem definition and rigorous analysis of jamming mitigation solutions in the Lightning Network. Simulations are being conducted to evaluate and improve the proposed solutions.</summary>
