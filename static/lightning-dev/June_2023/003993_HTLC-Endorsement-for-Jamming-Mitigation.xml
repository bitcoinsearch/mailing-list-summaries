    <summary>In the conversation, the participants discuss the economic compensation for damage caused by jamming attacks in the context of the HTLC endorsement system. The main concern is whether the fees paid to routing nodes fully compensate for the damage inflicted on the victim. It is suggested that different thresholds can be chosen based on node preferences, and suggestions are made for receiving nodes. The discussion also touches upon the difficulty of gaining reputation, which is proportional to the amount of damage that can be inflicted. Outlawing the cost of the attack from the system is seen as contrary to the goal of imposing a significant cost on persistent attackers. The focus is on compensating the victim rather than penalizing the attacker.The lack of a precise problem statement and formal correctness conditions for jamming mitigation is highlighted. The "Unjamming Lightning" paper, while claiming to systematically analyze the solution space, does not provide a formal definition of the problem independent of the adopted solution. The participant suggests evaluating the effectiveness of any jamming solution with the same rigor as modern cryptanalysis.The need for rigorous analysis and measurable bounds is emphasized to understand the impact of modifying parameters like channel opening default and the operational cost of a routing hop. While proving theorems may not be possible due to soft criteria such as user experience and ease of implementation, simulations are being conducted to assess quantifiable criteria.The challenges of mitigating DDoS attacks are acknowledged, and efforts are being made to utilize available tools within the lightning network context. The participant requests simulations to evaluate how HTLC endorsement may affect HTLC routing traffic.Overall, the conversation highlights the importance of economic compensation, formal analysis, and simulations in addressing the issue of jamming attacks in the lightning network.</summary>
