    <summary>In a recent discussion, the issue of compensating routing nodes for damage caused by jamming traffic in the Lightning Network was raised. The concern was whether the fees paid to routing nodes adequately compensate for the damage inflicted on victims. It was suggested that a different threshold could be chosen based on the preference of a node, allowing for more flexibility in determining compensation.The difficulty of gaining reputation as a routing node is proportional to the amount of damage that can be inflicted. This means that the more damage an attacker can cause, the harder it is for them to gain a good reputation within the network.It was pointed out that outlawing the cost of an attack would go against the goal of the proposed htlc endorsement system, which aims to impose a significant cost on persistent attackers. Instead, the focus should be on compensating the victim rather than penalizing the attacker.However, there is still a lack of clarity regarding the precise problem to be solved by any jamming mitigation and the required correctness conditions. The "unjamming lightning" paper, which claims to systematically analyze the solution space, does not provide a formal definition of the problem. It is suggested that the evaluation of any jamming solution should be done with the same conceptual rigor as modern cryptanalysis.Without a rigorous analysis, it would be difficult to set measurable bounds for any solution and determine if the operational cost of a routing hop is adequately covered by the payment made. Additional simulations are being conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of jamming solutions in practice.Furthermore, the potential impact of htlc endorsement on link-level liquidity needs to be addressed. Simulations are currently underway to determine how it might affect HTLC routing traffic.Overall, the aim is to strike a balance between user experience, ease of implementation, and effective mitigation of jamming attacks. It is acknowledged that DDoS attacks, in general, are challenging to mitigate, and efforts are being made to address these challenges within the Lightning Network.</summary>
