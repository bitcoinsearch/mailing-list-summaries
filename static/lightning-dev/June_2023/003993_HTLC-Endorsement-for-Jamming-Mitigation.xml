    <summary>In a discussion about the compensation for damage caused by jamming attacks in the context of HTLC endorsement, there are several points to consider. The primary concern is whether the fees paid to routing nodes fully compensate for the inflicted damage. The exact nature of this compensation is unclear, including whether it is proportional and if so, whether the ratio between fees and reputation is static or dynamic.Outlawing the cost of the attack from the system contradicts the goal of the proposed HTLC endorsement design, which aims to impose a significant cost on persistent attackers. The focus should be on compensating the victims rather than punishing the attackers. However, the precise problem to be solved and the correctness conditions required for a solution are not clearly defined in the "unjamming lightning" paper.There seems to be an underestimation of the liquidity griefing issues affecting Lightning and second-layers, of which jamming is just one aspect. It is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of any jamming solution with the same rigor as modern cryptanalysis to determine measurable bounds and identify potential issues like operational costs that may not be covered by the sum paid.Due to the subjective nature of some criteria such as user experience and ease of implementation, it is challenging to prove theorems. However, further simulations are being conducted to assess quantifiable criteria and bridge the gap between theory and practice. It is worth noting that mitigating DDoS attacks is notoriously difficult, so the available tools are being utilized to address these challenges within the context of Lightning.The possibility of HTLC endorsement affecting link-level liquidity more than it currently does raises concerns, and simulations are being conducted to evaluate the potential downgrade of HTLC routing traffic. Overall, the aim is to approach these issues with the utmost rigor and ensure that the proposed solutions align with the principles of financial cryptography and computer security literature.[0] provides additional information on the difficulties of mitigating DDoS attacks.</summary>
