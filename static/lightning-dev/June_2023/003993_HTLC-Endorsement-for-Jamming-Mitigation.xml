    <summary>The discussion revolves around the issue of compensating routing nodes for the damage caused by jamming attacks in the Lightning Network. The concern is whether the fees paid to routing nodes fully compensate for the inflicted damage. It is suggested that a different threshold could be chosen based on node preferences, and some suggestions are provided for receiving nodes.The difficulty of gaining reputation is said to be proportional to the amount of damage that can be inflicted. Outlawing the cost of the attack from the system is seen as contradictory to the goal of imposing a significant cost on persistent attackers. The focus is on compensating the victim rather than penalizing the attacker.The lack of a formal problem definition and correctness conditions for any jamming mitigation solution is highlighted. The "unjamming lightning" paper claims to analyze the solution space but does not provide a formalized problem definition. The author suggests evaluating the effectiveness of any jamming solution with the same rigor as modern cryptanalysis.Without rigorous analysis, it becomes difficult to set measurable bounds for any solution and determine if there is a wreckage due to subtle parameter modifications or inadequate compensation for operational costs. Simulation is mentioned as a tool to evaluate the impact of HTLC endorsement on link-level liquidity.The limitations of proving theorems due to "soft" criteria like user experience and ease of implementation are acknowledged. The researchers are working on simulations to assess quantifiable criteria and bridge the gap between theory and practice. The challenges of mitigating DDoS attacks are also acknowledged, and the researchers are striving to do their best within the Lightning Network context.In response to a suggestion about simulating how HTLC endorsement might affect HTLC routing traffic, it is mentioned that simulations are currently running.Overall, the conversation highlights the need for further analysis, simulations, and evaluation to address the liquidity griefing issues and enhance the effectiveness of jamming mitigation solutions in the Lightning Network.</summary>
