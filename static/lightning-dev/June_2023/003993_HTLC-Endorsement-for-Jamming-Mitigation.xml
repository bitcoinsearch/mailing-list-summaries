    <summary>The discussion revolves around the compensation for routing nodes in the event of an attack and the effectiveness of proposed jamming mitigation solutions in the Lightning Network. The concern is whether the fees paid to routing nodes adequately compensate for the damage caused by jamming traffic. The protocol currently observes routing fees as the only observable damage, but suggestions are being made to choose a different threshold based on node preferences.The difficulty of gaining reputation is proportional to the amount of damage that can be inflicted. Outlawing the cost of the attack from the system contradicts the goal of imposing a significant cost on persistent attackers. The focus should be on compensating the victim rather than worrying about the attacker's deep pockets.There is a lack of precise problem formulation and correctness conditions in the "unjamming lightning" paper. The writer suggests evaluating the effectiveness of any jamming solution with the same rigor as modern cryptanalysis, using notions like shannon cipher, perfect security, and switching lemma. Without such rigorous analysis, it is challenging to measure the bounds of any solution and determine when there is a wreckage due to modifications in parameters or inadequate coverage of operational costs.Due to the soft criteria involved, proving theorems is difficult, but further simulations are being conducted to assess quantifiable criteria and bridge the gap between theory and practice. It is acknowledged that DDoS attacks are notoriously difficult to mitigate, and the available tools are being employed to address them in the Lightning Network.The suggestion is made to come up with simulations to evaluate how HTLC endorsement might affect the downgrade of HTLC routing traffic. A simulation is currently running to explore this possibility.</summary>
