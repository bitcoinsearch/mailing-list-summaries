    <summary>The discussion revolves around the issue of compensating routing nodes for the damage caused by jamming attacks in the Lightning Network. The sender raises concerns about whether the fees paid to routing nodes fully compensate for the inflicted damage and questions if the compensation is proportional or static. They also mention that outlawing the cost of the attack contradicts the design goal of the proposed htlc endorsement system.In response, the recipient clarifies that the only observable damage in the protocol is routing fees. They suggest that it would be straightforward to choose a different threshold based on the preference of a node. Regarding the compensation, they state that the difficulty to gain reputation is proportional to the amount of damage that can be inflicted, indicating that the compensation is dynamic rather than static.The sender expresses their uncertainty about the precise problem that needs to be solved by a jamming mitigation solution. They note that the "unjamming lightning" paper lacks a formal definition of the problem and calls for a rigorous analysis similar to modern cryptanalysis. They emphasize the need for measurable bounds and evaluating the effectiveness of any solution.In response, the recipient acknowledges the undervaluation of liquidity griefing issues affecting Lightning and second-layers, including jamming attacks. They agree that a rigorous analysis is necessary to provide measurable bounds for the solutions. Due to the soft criteria involved, proving theorems might be challenging, but they are conducting simulations to assess the quantifiable criteria.The sender suggests running simulations to evaluate how htlc endorsement might impact HTLC routing traffic. The recipient confirms that simulations are already underway. The conversation concludes with polite salutations.Overall, the discussion addresses concerns about the compensation for routing nodes in jamming attacks, the need for a formal problem definition and rigorous analysis, and the ongoing simulations to evaluate the impact of htlc endorsement on routing traffic.</summary>
