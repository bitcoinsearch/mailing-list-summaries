    <summary>The discussion is centered around the proposed HTLC endorsement system and its potential to compensate for damage inflicted by attacks. The compensation would be in the form of routing fees, but it is unclear whether these fees would fully economically compensate the victim. The difficulty to gain reputation is proportional to the amount of damage that can be inflicted. Outlawing the cost of the attack from the system guarantees sounds contrary to the HTLC endorsement design goal of producing a mitigation that has a significant cost to persistent attackers. The liquidity griefing issues affecting Lightning and second-layers are novel from the viewpoint of financial cryptography/computer security literature. There is an undervaluation of how much these issues affect these systems. Without rigorous analysis, we cannot give measurable bounds to any solution, and know when there is a wreckage because we're modifying some subtle parameters like channel opening default. The criteria are "soft" (UX, ease of implementation), so we cannot prove theorems. Simulations are being run to see if theory meets practice. DDoS attacks are notoriously difficult to mitigate.</summary>
