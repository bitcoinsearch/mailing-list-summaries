    <summary>The discussion revolves around the proposed htlc endorsement system for mitigating jamming attacks in the Lightning Network. The concern is whether the fees paid in this system fully compensate for the damage inflicted on the victim. It is suggested that different thresholds can be chosen based on node preferences, and suggestions are provided for receiving nodes.Regarding the compensation, it is mentioned that the difficulty to gain reputation is proportional to the amount of damage that can be caused. Outlawing the cost of the attack from the system contradicts the design goal of imposing a significant cost on persistent attackers.The lack of a formal problem definition and correctness conditions in the "unjamming lightning" paper is highlighted. The author believes that there is an undervaluation of liquidity griefing issues affecting Lightning and second-layers, including jamming, in the financial cryptography/computer security literature. It is suggested that any jamming solution should be evaluated with the same rigor as modern cryptanalysis.Without such rigorous analysis, it is difficult to determine measurable bounds for any solution or identify when there is a problem due to subtle parameter modifications or adversaries having superior sources of information for launching jamming attacks.Due to the "soft" criteria involved, proving theorems is challenging. However, simulations are being conducted to assess the quantifiable criteria and bridge the gap between theory and practice.The request for simulations on how the htlc endorsement system might affect HTLC routing traffic is acknowledged, and it is stated that simulations are currently underway.Overall, the discussion highlights the need for careful evaluation, formalization, and rigorous analysis to address jamming attacks in the Lightning Network effectively.</summary>
