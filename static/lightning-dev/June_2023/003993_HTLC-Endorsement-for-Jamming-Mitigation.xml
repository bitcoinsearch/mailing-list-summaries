    <summary>In this email exchange, the sender raises concerns about the proposed htlc endorsement system and its ability to economically compensate for the damage caused by jamming attacks. They question whether the fees paid to routing nodes fully compensate the victim and inquire about the ratio between fees and reputation. The response acknowledges that the protocol only observes routing fees as the damage and suggests that a different threshold can be chosen based on node preference. It also states that the difficulty to gain reputation is proportional to the amount of damage inflicted.The sender notes that outlawing the cost of the attack from the system contradicts the design goal of having a significant cost for persistent attackers. The response clarifies that the focus is on compensating the victim rather than penalizing the attacker. The sender expresses a need for a formal definition of the problem to be solved and the correctness conditions required for a solution. They emphasize the importance of evaluating the effectiveness of any jamming solution with the same rigor as modern cryptanalysis.The response acknowledges the novelty of liquidity griefing issues in Lightning and second-layers and suggests evaluating the effectiveness of jamming solutions with conceptual rigor. It highlights the challenges in giving measurable bounds to solutions due to "soft" criteria such as user experience and ease of implementation. Simulations are being conducted to assess the impact of htlc endorsement on link-level liquidity.The sender requests simulations on how htlc endorsement might downgrade HTLC routing traffic, and the response confirms that simulations are running. The email concludes with the signature of Clara and includes a link to an article on mitigating DDoS attacks.</summary>
