    <summary>In a recent conversation, the issue of compensating routing nodes for damage caused by jamming traffic in the Lightning Network was discussed. The concern raised was whether the fees paid to routing nodes fully compensate for the inflicted damage. It was mentioned that the only observed damage in the protocol is the routing fees, and it was suggested that a different threshold could be chosen based on node preferences.The difficulty of gaining reputation was stated to be proportional to the amount of damage that can be inflicted. However, outlawing the cost of the attack from the system goes against the goal of imposing a significant cost on persistent attackers, as stated in the htlc endorsement design goal.There was a request for a formal definition of the problem to be solved by any jamming mitigation solution, as well as the required correctness conditions. It was noted that the "unjamming lightning" paper does not provide such formalization. The novelty of liquidity griefing issues affecting Lightning and second-layers was emphasized, and it was suggested that the effectiveness of any jamming solution should be evaluated with the same rigor as modern cryptanalysis.The lack of rigorous analysis was identified as an obstacle to providing measurable bounds to any solution, especially when subtle parameters like channel opening defaults are modified. Additionally, it was acknowledged that DDoS attacks are notoriously difficult to mitigate.Regarding the impact of htlc endorsement on link-level liquidity, simulations were mentioned to be currently running to evaluate its potential downgrade on HTLC routing traffic.In conclusion, while there are challenges in providing formal definitions and rigorous analysis, efforts are being made to evaluate the effectiveness of jamming solutions through simulations and the use of available tools.[0] Link to a relevant article on the difficulties of mitigating DDoS attacks: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128603004250?casa_token=BauKTUZ1yEYAAAAA:Ny9OvPXunkvLZgJD1bYQ_amV-rsMVRbYKozWchYB9ZpFZ3dNFfJnK74UYl7di9R24aDhrw</summary>
