    <summary>Antoine Riard has proposed to organize the LN Summit in Africa for 2024. He believes that Africa would be a suitable location for the summit due to its rich cultural and historical past, the fragmented financial systems in many African countries that could benefit from a compatible payment protocol, the growing number of Lightning developers from Africa, and the potential for local Lightning economies to thrive. Antoine suggests announcing the summit ahead of time to address operational challenges such as visa travels and tropical weather. He also emphasizes the importance of a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the organizing process.To determine the best location for the summit, Antoine plans to survey countries with reasonable operational stability. Some of the countries he mentioned include Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He will gather feedback privately from Lightning attendees using neutral and technical proof of works heuristics. Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint for this purpose. He encourages Lightning Network developers to join the organization effort, as it presents an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors. Antoine promises to maintain strong transparency and accountability standards and welcomes any objections or feedback during the coming weeks.The proposal received positive feedback from the lightning dev community, with nully0x suggesting to connect with existing Bitcoin and lightning network communities in Africa for support in planning the summit.In other news, The Lightning-dev Digest, Vol 94, Issue 17 is a mailing list managed by the Linux Foundation for discussions related to the Lightning Network protocol.
