    <summary>Antoine Riard, a member of the lightning dev community, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes that Africa is an ideal location due to its cultural richness and fragmented financial systems that could benefit from a compatible payment protocol. Additionally, Antoine notes the growing number of Lightning developers on the continent. While he acknowledges the challenges associated with organizing an event in Africa, such as visa issues and tropical weather, Antoine believes that announcing the summit early will help address these challenges. He emphasizes the importance of transparency and fairness in the organization process.To ensure a successful summit, Antoine suggests starting small by surveying countries with operational stability that could host the event, including Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He plans to privately share the feedback with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of work heuristics. Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint for anyone interested in being part of the organization and encourages LN developers to participate, as it presents an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors.The Lightning-dev Digest, Vol 94, Issue 17 has come to an end. This digest is a mailing list provided by foundation.org and can be accessed at https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev. The mailing list serves as a platform for discussions and exchange of information related to the Lightning Network development. The Lightning Network is an off-chain transaction protocol designed to provide faster and cheaper transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. It enables users to create payment channels between themselves, allowing multiple transactions without recording each one on the blockchain. This scalability solution has gained significant attention in the cryptocurrency community as it has the potential to alleviate congestion and high fees associated with the Bitcoin network. By participating in the Lightning-dev Digest, individuals can stay updated on the latest developments and advancements in Lightning Network technology.</summary>
