    <summary>Antoine Riard, a member of the lightning dev community, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes Africa is an ideal location due to its rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that could benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers on the continent, and the potential for local Lightning economies to thrive. Antoine suggests starting small by surveying countries with operational stability like Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He plans to gather feedback privately from Lightning attendees using neutral and technical proof of work heuristics. Antoine emphasizes transparency and accountability, welcoming objections or suggestions from the lightning dev community. To address challenges such as visa travels and tropical weather, he believes it is essential to announce the summit far in advance. Antoine encourages a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency. He has set up a dedicated communication endpoint, lnsummit2024 at ariard.me, for anyone interested in being part of the organization or transferring knowledge between generations of contributors. Antoine commits to strong transparency and accountability standards and encourages actions over mere talk in open-source matters.The Lightning-dev Digest, Vol 94, Issue 17, is a mailing list hosted by the Linux Foundation for developers and enthusiasts interested in the Lightning Network technology.
