    <summary>In a recent email conversation, Antoine Riard proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlighted several reasons for holding the summit in Africa, including the continent's beauty, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems, and the potential for growth in local Lightning economies. Antoine mentioned that it would be beneficial to connect with existing Bitcoin and lightning network communities in Africa, such as Qala Africa and BitDevs, to help with the planning process. He also emphasized the need for transparency and accountability in the organization of the summit.Antoine suggested starting small by surveying countries with operational stability, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, and others, to determine the best location for the event. He mentioned that he will share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics. Antoine set up a dedicated communication endpoint for this purpose: lnsummit2024 at ariard.me. He encouraged Lightning developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization, as it presents an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.It was noted in the email conversation that different communities across Africa already organize local meetups focused on technical sessions around Bitcoin and the lightning network. Nully0x expressed support for connecting with these communities first to bootstrap the planning process.Overall, the proposal to hold the LN Summit in Africa received positive feedback from the lightning dev community. The next step will involve reaching out to these communities and conducting surveys to gather more information and ensure consensus among senior Lightning developers regarding potential visa issues and the preferred host country for the summit.The Lightning-dev Digest, Vol 94, Issue 17, marks the end of another informative discussion on lightning network development. The Linux Foundation provides a platform for participants to exchange ideas and share updates on this evolving technology.
