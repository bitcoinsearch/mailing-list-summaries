    <summary>Antoine Riard, a member of the lightning dev community, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa for 2024. He highlights several reasons why Africa is an ideal location for the summit, including its rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that could benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and the potential for local Lightning economies to flourish.Antoine acknowledges that the announcement of the summit organization is usually not done on open communication channels to maintain serenity in engineering conversations and to avoid potential trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, due to the operational challenges that may arise, such as visa travels and tropical weather, he believes it is better to announce the summit far in advance. He also suggests adopting a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the process.Antoine invites feedback and objections to his involvement in organizing the LN Summit 2024, emphasizing his commitment to strong transparency and accountability standards. He plans to start small by surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that can serve as potential locations for the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He intends to share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer.To facilitate communication regarding the summit, Antoine has set up a dedicated email address: lnsummit2024@ariard.me. He encourages Lightning developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization, viewing it as an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors.Overall, Antoine's proposal to hold the LN Summit in Africa in 2024 has been met with enthusiasm from the lightning dev community, who see it as a great idea with significant potential.</summary>
