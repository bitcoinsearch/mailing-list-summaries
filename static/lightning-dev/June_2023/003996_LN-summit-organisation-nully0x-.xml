    <summary>Antoine Riard, a member of the lightning dev community, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlights the reasons to hold the summit in Africa, including the continent's beauty, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that can benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers in Africa, and the potential for local Lightning economies to thrive. Typically, the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit is not announced on open communication channels, but in this case, Antoine believes it is necessary due to operational challenges such as visa travels and tropical weather. He also suggests a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the process. Antoine invites objections or feedback regarding his contribution to the organization of LN Summit 2024. He plans to start small by surveying countries with operational stability in Africa and sharing the feedback privately with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer. Antoine provides a dedicated communication endpoint for the LN Summit 2024 and encourages Lightning developers to reach out and be part of the organization, emphasizing the opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors.</summary>
