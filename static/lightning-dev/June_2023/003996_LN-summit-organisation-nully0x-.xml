    <summary>Antoine Riard, a lightning dev, has proposed to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlights several reasons for choosing Africa as the location, including its rich cultural and historical past, the potential for solving financial system fragmentation with a compatible payment protocol, the growing number of Lightning developers in Africa, and the opportunity to develop local Lightning economies.Antoine acknowledges that it is unusual to announce the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit on open communication channels. However, given the potential operational challenges (such as visas and tropical weather), he believes it's better to announce the event far in advance. He also suggests adopting a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency throughout the process.Antoine invites feedback or objections to his contribution to organizing the LN Summit 2024. He emphasizes his commitment to transparency and accountability and encourages individuals to express their opinions publicly or privately.To start the planning process, Antoine plans to survey countries in Africa with reasonable operational stability that could host the summit. He mentions Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, among others. He intends to share the results of the survey with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer.Antoine provides a dedicated communication endpoint, lnsummit2024@ariard.me, for LN developers interested in being part of the organization. He sees this as an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.Overall, Antoine's proposal to host the LN Summit in Africa in 2024 has generated positive feedback from the lightning dev community. The next steps involve connecting with African communities and conducting surveys to determine the most suitable location for the event.</summary>
