    <summary>Antoine Riard has proposed to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlights several reasons why Africa is a suitable location for the summit, including its cultural and historical richness, fragmented financial systems that can benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and the potential for local Lightning economies to thrive. Antoine acknowledges that announcing the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit on open communication channels is not common practice, but due to the operational challenges that may arise (such as visa travels and "tropical weather"), he believes it is better to announce the event far in advance. He also suggests adopting a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the process.Antoine invites anyone with objections to his contribution to the organization of LN Summit 2024 to voice their concerns publicly, on the thread, or privately via email. He emphasizes the importance of setting strong transparency and accountability standards and encourages contributors to actively participate in the organization.To start the planning process, Antoine proposes surveying countries in Africa with reasonable operational stability that could potentially host the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, among others. He plans to share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics towards the end of the summer.Antoine provides a dedicated communication endpoint, lnsummit2024 at ariard.me, for LN developers who wish to be part of the organization and transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.Overall, Antoine's proposal to organize the LN Summit in Africa in 2024 aims to leverage the continent's potential, address operational challenges, and foster collaboration among Lightning developers.</summary>
