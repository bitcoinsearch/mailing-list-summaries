    <summary>Antoine Riard, a member of the lightning dev community, has proposed to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlights several reasons for choosing Africa as the location, including its rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems, a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and the potential for local Lightning economies. Antoine acknowledges that the operational challenges of organizing such an event in Africa may be more complex, so he believes it is important to announce the summit early to allow for proper planning. He also mentions the need for a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the process. Antoine invites feedback and objections to his contribution to the organization of the summit. He plans to start small by surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that can accommodate the event. Antoine provides a dedicated communication endpoint for those interested in being part of the organization and emphasizes the opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors. Overall, Antoine's proposal aims to bring together the lightning dev community and leverage the potential of Africa for the future of Lightning network development.[Link to original message](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/20230623/7469a241/attachment-0001.html)</summary>
