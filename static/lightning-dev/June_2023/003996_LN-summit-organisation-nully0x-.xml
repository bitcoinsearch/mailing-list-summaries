    <summary>Antoine Riard, a member of the lightning dev community, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes that Africa is an ideal location for the summit due to its rich culture, historical significance, fragmented financial systems, and a growing number of Lightning developers. Antoine acknowledges the challenges involved in organizing such an event, including visa travels and tropical weather, and emphasizes the importance of transparency and accountability. He suggests starting small by surveying countries with operational stability like Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint for the LN Summit 2024 and encourages Lightning Network developers to reach out and be part of the organization.</summary>
