    <summary>Antoine Riard, a member of the lightning dev community, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlights several reasons for choosing Africa as the location, including its cultural and historical significance, fragmented financial systems that could benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers in Africa, and the potential for local Lightning economies to thrive.Antoine acknowledges that typically the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit events is not announced on open communication channels to maintain a focused engineering conversation. However, due to the operational challenges involved in hosting the summit in Africa, such as visa travels and weather conditions, Antoine believes it is best to announce it far in advance. He mentions that operations and financial resources should be sufficient, but encourages a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency throughout the planning process.To start small, Antoine plans to survey countries in Africa with reasonable operational stability that could serve as suitable locations for the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, among others. He intends to share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics towards the end of the summer.Antoine provides a dedicated communication endpoint (lnsummit2024 at ariard.me) for those interested in being part of the organization and emphasizes that this is an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.Overall, Antoine's proposal to host the LN Summit in Africa in 2024 aims to leverage the continent's potential and foster collaboration among Lightning developers while ensuring transparency and accountability in the planning process.</summary>
