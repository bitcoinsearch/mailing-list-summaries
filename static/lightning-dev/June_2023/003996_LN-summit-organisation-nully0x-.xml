    <summary>Antoine Riard, a member of the lightning dev community, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlights the reasons for choosing Africa as the location, including its rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that can be solved with a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and the potential for local Lightning economies to thrive.Antoine acknowledges that the announcement of the summit is being made on open communication channels, which is unusual to maintain serenity in engineering conversations. However, due to the operational challenges involved in organizing the event in Africa, such as visa travels and tropical weather, it is better to announce it far in advance for better preparation.Antoine encourages the participation of multiple stakeholders to ensure fairness and transparency in the process. He invites objections or feedback on his contribution to the organization of LN Summit 2024, either publicly, on the thread, or privately via email. He emphasizes his commitment to setting strong transparency and accountability standards.As a first step, Antoine plans to survey countries with reasonable operational stability that can serve as potential locations for the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, etc. He will share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer.Antoine provides a dedicated communication endpoint, lnsummit2024@ariard.me, for those interested in being part of the organization. He sees this as an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors.Overall, this proposal from Antoine Riard aims to bring the LN Summit to Africa in 2024, highlighting the continent's potential and the need for collaboration among stakeholders for a successful event.</summary>
