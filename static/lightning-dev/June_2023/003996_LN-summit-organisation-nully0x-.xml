    <summary>Antoine Riard, a member of the lightning dev community, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlights several reasons why Africa would be an ideal location for the summit, including its rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that could benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and the potential for local Lightning economies to thrive.Antoine acknowledges that typically the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit is not announced on open communication channels to maintain engineering conversation serenity and avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, due to the potential operational challenges involved in organizing the summit in Africa, such as visas and tropical weather, Antoine believes it is better to announce it well in advance. He also suggests a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency throughout the process.Antoine invites anyone with objections to his contribution to organizing the LN Summit 2024 to voice their concerns publicly, on the thread, or privately via email. He emphasizes his commitment to setting high standards of transparency and accountability. He plans to start small by surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that could serve as suitable locations for the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. The feedback will be shared privately with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer.Antoine provides a dedicated communication endpoint for the summit (lnsummit2024@ariard.me) and encourages Lightning developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization, as it presents an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors. He also mentions that he co-organized the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, so he already has operational templates in place.Overall, Antoine's proposal to organize the LN Summit in Africa aims to leverage the continent's potential and bring together the Lightning community for knowledge sharing and advancing the development of Lightning technologies.</summary>
