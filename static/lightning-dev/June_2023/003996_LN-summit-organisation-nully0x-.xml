    <summary>Antoine Riard, a member of the Lightning dev community, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. Africa is seen as an ideal location due to its rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that could benefit from a compatible payment protocol, and a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent. The announcement of the summit on open communication channels is unusual, but necessary due to the operational challenges involved, such as visa travels and tropical weather. The organizers are seeking a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency throughout the process.Antoine welcomes objections or feedback regarding his contribution to the organization of the LN Summit 2024. He emphasizes the importance of setting strong transparency and accountability standards, and encourages individuals to speak up if they have any concerns. The first step in the planning process will involve surveying countries with reasonable operational stability, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, etc. Antoine plans to share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer.For communication regarding the LN Summit 2024, a dedicated email address has been set up: lnsummit2024@ariard.me. Antoine invites Lightning Network developers to reach out if they are interested in being part of the organization, as it presents an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors. Antoine also mentions that he has previous experience in organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, providing operational templates for reference.Overall, the proposal to host the LN Summit in Africa in 2024 has generated excitement within the community, with members recognizing the potential benefits of bringing the event to the continent.</summary>
