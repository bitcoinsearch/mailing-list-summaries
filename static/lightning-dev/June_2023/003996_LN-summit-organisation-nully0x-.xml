    <summary>Antoine Riard, a member of the lightning dev community, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlights several reasons for choosing Africa as the location, including its rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that can benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers in Africa, and the potential for developing local Lightning economies.Antoine acknowledges that it is not usual to announce the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit on open communication channels, but due to the complexity of operational challenges such as visa travels and tropical weather, he believes it is better to announce it well in advance. He also suggests adopting a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the process.To start the planning process, Antoine plans to survey countries with reasonable operational stability, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria, to determine the suitable location for the summit. He invites Lightning Network developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization and emphasizes that this is an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.Antoine provides a dedicated communication endpoint for the LN Summit 2024 at lnsummit2024@ariard.me. He concludes his message by mentioning that he has previous experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021.Source: [Lightning-dev Mailing List](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/20230623/7469a241/attachment-0001.html)</summary>
