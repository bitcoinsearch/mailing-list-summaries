    <summary>Antoine Riard has proposed to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes that there are several reasons to hold the summit in Africa, such as the continent's beauty, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that can be solved with a compatible payment protocol, an energetic population, and a growing number of Lightning developers. Antoine acknowledges that usually, the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit is not announced on open communication channels to maintain engineering conversation serenity. However, due to the potential operational challenges of organizing the summit in Africa, he believes it's better to announce it far in advance. Antoine encourages participation from multiple stakeholders to ensure fairness and transparency in the process. He invites objections to his contribution to the organization of LN Summit 2024 and promises to maintain strong transparency and accountability standards. Antoine plans to start small by surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that can serve as potential locations for the summit. He will share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer. Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint for LN Summit 2024: lnsummit2024@ariard.me. He also invites Lightning Network developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization and transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.</summary>
