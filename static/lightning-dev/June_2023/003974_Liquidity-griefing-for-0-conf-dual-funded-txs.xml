    <summary>Bastien Teinturier, a contributor to the Lightning Network, has written a post on how to protect against liquidity griefing attacks from malicious peers while offering 0-conf services. The post highlights the challenges created by the introduction of dual-funded transactions and how nodes offering 0-conf services expose themselves to liquidity griefing. To avoid this, Bastien suggests that the "soft lock" strategy be used when selecting utxos for non-0-conf funding attempts, while 0-conf funding attempts should ignore soft locked utxos. However, he notes that this strategy may still be susceptible to liquidity griefing with dual-funding or splicing. Bastien also suggests using a long-term solution in which the Staking Credentials framework could be deployed by dual-funding market-makers beyond routing hops. He states that the dual-funding initiator should pay the maker a fee scale up on the amount of UTXOs contributed and some worst-case liquidity griefing scenario. In eclair, they are currently doing an "opportunistic" 0-conf, but they cannot do that anymore when mixing 0-conf and non-0-conf funding attempts because the utxos may be soft-locked, preventing them from upgrading to 0-conf. Bastien invites others to share their ideas on how to improve the situation and offer good enough protections against liquidity griefing for nodes offering 0-conf services.</summary>
