    <summary>The Validating Lightning Signer (VLS) team is excited to announce the Beta release of their MVP2 version, which aims to provide security against accidental fund loss and malicious nodes. They encourage LN application developers to join their Matrix room, submit feature requests, or try out VLS with sample CLN or LDK nodes.While the VLS beta offers protection against common ways that a malicious node can steal user funds, it does not cover all possible scenarios for fund loss. Therefore, it is recommended to run VLS in a testnet environment or with limited funds until the production release milestone is reached and users are confident in its ability to protect against all relevant scenarios.Some highlights for developers include compatibility with CLN and LDK, encrypted cloud state backup, disaster recovery from signer and node failure, a comprehensive set of layer-2 validation rules, optional validation rules, a complete set of layer-1 validation rules, heartbeat generation, allowlist for approved destinations, and UTXO set oracle for safe on-chain state. A full changelog can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/lightning-signer/validating-lightning-signer/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).Planned for the next release are features such as running the signer in a `no-std` environment without a standard library, the ability to run the signer on devices with limited RAM and ROM, and performance tuning for embedded processors. Future releases will include routing, BOLT-12 support, VSS integration, and multisig capabilities.For developers seeking an impactful FOSS project to contribute to, the VLS team welcomes their help. Interested individuals can get in touch with them through Matrix to learn how they can get involved in the project.To learn more about the VLS Beta release, visit their website [here](https://vls.tech/posts/vls-beta/).</summary>
