    <summary>The VLS team has announced the Beta release of the validating lightning signer, which is their MVP2 release focused on ensuring security against accidental fund loss and malicious nodes. They encourage LN application developers to join their Matrix room, submit feature requests, or try out VLS with sample CLN or LDK nodes.While the VLS beta provides security against common ways a malicious node may steal user funds, it does not cover all scenarios where users might lose funds. It is recommended to run VLS in testnet or with limited funds until the production release milestone is reached and users are comfortable with its protection against relevant scenarios.For developers, the validating lightning signer offers various highlights including compatibility with CLN and LDK, encrypted cloud state backup, disaster recovery from signer and node failure, a complete set of layer-2 validation rules, optional validation rules, a complete set of layer-1 validation rules, heartbeat generation, allowlist for approved destinations, and UTXO set oracle for safe on-chain state tracking.The full changelog can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/lightning-signer/validating-lightning-signer/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md). The next release plans include running the signer in a no-std environment without a standard library, running on modest amounts of RAM and ROM, and tuning performance for embedded processors.Planned for later releases are routing, BOLT-12 support, VSS integration, and multisig. Developers who are interested in contributing to this FOSS project are encouraged to get in touch with the VLS team on Matrix.To learn more about the VLS Beta release, visit [vls.tech](https://vls.tech/posts/vls-beta/).</summary>
