    <summary>The Validating Lightning Signer (VLS) team is excited to announce the Beta release of their MVP2, which aims to provide security against accidental fund loss and malicious nodes. LN application developers are encouraged to join their Matrix room, submit feature requests, or try out VLS with sample CLN or LDK nodes. While the beta version of VLS offers protection against common ways that malicious nodes can steal user funds, it does not cover all potential scenarios where users may lose funds. Therefore, it is recommended to run VLS in testnet or with limited funds until the production release milestone is reached and users are confident in its ability to protect against all relevant scenarios.For developers, VLS offers several highlights including compatibility with CLN and LDK, encrypted cloud state backup, disaster recovery from signer and node failure, a complete set of layer-2 validation rules, optional validation rules, a complete set of layer-1 validation rules, heartbeat generation, allowlist for approved destinations, and UTXO set oracle for safe on-chain state. A full changelog can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/lightning-signer/validating-lightning-signer/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).In the next release, VLS plans to make improvements such as running the signer in a `no-std` environment without a standard library, enabling the signer to run on devices with limited RAM and ROM, and tuning performance for embedded processors. Future releases are also planned to include routing, BOLT-12 support, VSS integration, and multisig capabilities.Developers interested in contributing to an impactful FOSS project can reach out to the VLS team on Matrix to learn how they can get involved.
