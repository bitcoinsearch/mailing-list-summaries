    <summary>The Validating Lightning Signer (VLS) team is excited to announce the Beta release of their MVP2 version, which focuses on ensuring security against accidental fund loss and malicious nodes. They encourage LN application developers to join their Matrix room, submit feature requests, or try out VLS with sample CLN or LDK nodes.While the VLS beta provides security against common ways that a malicious node can steal user funds, it does not cover all scenarios where users might lose funds. Therefore, it is recommended to run VLS in testnet or with limited funds until the production release milestone is reached and users are confident in its ability to protect against relevant scenarios.For developers, some highlights of VLS include its compatibility with CLN and LDK, encrypted cloud state backup, disaster recovery from signer and node failure, a comprehensive set of layer-2 validation rules, optional validation rules, layer-1 validation rules for on-chain channel state tracking, heartbeat generation, allowlist for approved destinations, and UTXO set oracle for safe on-chain state. The full changelog can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/lightning-signer/validating-lightning-signer/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).In the next release, the team plans to make improvements such as enabling the signer to run in a `no-std` environment without a standard library, allowing it to operate with modest amounts of RAM and ROM, and optimizing performance for embedded processors.Future releases of VLS will include routing, BOLT-12 support, VSS integration, and multisig capabilities. The team welcomes developers who are looking for an impactful FOSS project to contribute to and invites them to get in touch on Matrix.To learn more about the VLS Beta, visit their [website](https://vls.tech/posts/vls-beta/).</summary>
