    <summary>The Validating Lightning Signer (VLS) team is pleased to announce the Beta release of their MVP2 version, which focuses on security against accidental fund loss and malicious nodes. They invite LN application developers to join their Matrix room, submit feature requests, or try out VLS with sample CLN or LDK nodes. While the VLS beta provides security against common ways that a malicious node might steal user funds, it does not cover all potential scenarios for fund loss. Therefore, they recommend running VLS in testnet or with limited funds until the production release milestone is reached.For developers, the VLS beta offers several highlights including compatibility with CLN and LDK, encrypted cloud state backup, disaster recovery from signer and node failure, a complete set of layer-2 validation rules, optional validation rules, a complete set of layer-1 validation rules for on-chain channel state tracking, heartbeat generation, allowlist for approved destinations, and UTXO set oracle for safe on-chain state. A full changelog can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/lightning-signer/validating-lightning-signer/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).In the next release, the VLS team plans to make the signer run in a `no-std` environment without a standard library, enable the signer to run on modest amounts of RAM and ROM, and improve performance for embedded processors. Planned for later releases are routing, BOLT-12 support, VSS integration, and multisig.If you're a developer looking to contribute to a FOSS project, the VLS team welcomes your help. You can get in touch with them on Matrix to learn more about how you can get involved.To learn more about the VLS beta release, visit [this link](https://vls.tech/posts/vls-beta/).</summary>
