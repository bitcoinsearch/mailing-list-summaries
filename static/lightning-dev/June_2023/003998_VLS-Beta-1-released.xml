    <summary>The Validating Lightning Signer (VLS) team is excited to announce the Beta release of their MVP2 version, which focuses on providing security against accidental fund loss and malicious nodes. They encourage LN application developers to join their Matrix room, submit feature requests, or try out VLS with sample CLN or LDK nodes.While the VLS beta offers security against common ways that a malicious node may steal user funds, it does not cover all possible scenarios where users might lose funds. Therefore, they recommend running VLS in testnet or with limited funds until they reach the production release milestone and users are confident that it adequately protects against relevant scenarios.For developers, the VLS Beta comes with several highlights, including compatibility with CLN and LDK, encrypted cloud state backup, disaster recovery from signer and node failure, a complete set of layer-2 validation rules, optional validation rules, a full set of layer-1 validation rules for on-chain channel state tracking, heartbeat generation, allowlist for approved destinations, and UTXO set oracle for safe on-chain state. A detailed changelog can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/lightning-signer/validating-lightning-signer/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).In the next release, the team plans to make the signer run in a `no-std` environment without a standard library, allowing it to operate with modest amounts of RAM and ROM. They also aim to optimize performance for embedded processors.Future releases of VLS will include routing, BOLT-12 support, VSS integration, and multisig capabilities. The team welcomes developers who are looking for a rewarding FOSS project to contribute to and encourages them to get in touch through Matrix to explore how they can get involved.To learn more about the VLS Beta release and its features, visit their website [here](https://vls.tech/posts/vls-beta/).</summary>
