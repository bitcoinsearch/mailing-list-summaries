    <summary>Satoshi Nakamoto responded to Peter Todd's statement about the ownership of the domain vistomail.com. Satoshi clarified that the domain hasn't changed hands since he registered it and the update on who.is was simply an addition of years to the ownership. He mentioned that he added the years because the domain was set to expire soon. Satoshi expressed his frustration with Peter's constant arguments and smart comments on Twitter, urging him to stop arguing and work harder. He also mentioned that he noticed Peter trying to start an argument even in their current conversation.To address the issue of Craig Wright pretending to be the creator of Bitcoin and suing everyone, Satoshi added satoshin at vistomail.com and contact at vistomail.com as lightning addresses. He stated that he has many other ways to prove that he is the real Satoshi, but he never cared to do so because he knows he is the real one. Satoshi also mentioned that he saw all the messages, including Peter's, and added his lightning address to contact at secureanonymoussurfing.com to give a compliment to the Lightning team.In conclusion, Satoshi Nakamoto praised the Lightning Network for its achievements in global business and scaling through fast and secure lightning payments. He created a lightning address, satoshi at vistomail.com, and commended the network's ability to process more transactions per second than any financial instrument. However, there were concerns about the ownership of the vistomail.com domain, with Peter Todd suggesting blocking the entire domain from the list due to potential scammers pretending to be Satoshi.</summary>
