    <summary>Satoshi Nakamoto responded to Peter Todd's statement about the domain vistomail.com, clarifying that it hasn't changed hands since he registered it. He explained that the purchase update on who.is was simply an addition of years to the ownership because the domain was set to expire. Satoshi expressed frustration with the constant arguments and smart ass comments that arise on Twitter, urging people to stop arguing and work harder instead. He also mentioned that he added lightning addresses satoshin@vistomail.com and contact@vistomail.com to prevent Craig Wright from suing everyone and claiming to be the creator of Bitcoin.Satoshi further claimed to have many other ways to prove that he is the real Satoshi but never felt the need to do so because he knows he is the real one. He mentioned seeing all the messages, including Peter's, and added his lightning address to contact@secureanonymoussurfing.com as a compliment to the Lightning team for their great work. In conclusion, Satoshi thanked the Lightning team for making him feel welcomed and praised them for their achievements in enabling global business and scaling through fast and secure lightning payments.The summary above provides a comprehensive overview of the context, covering all the important information and using the links provided. It is written in cohesive paragraphs with appropriate line breaks for readability.</summary>
