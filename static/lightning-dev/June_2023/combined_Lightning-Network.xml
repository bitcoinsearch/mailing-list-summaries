    <summary>In an email dated June 3, 2023, Satoshi Nakamoto expressed his satisfaction with the Lightning Network as a means of conducting global business with fast and secure lightning payments. He created a new lightning address, satoshi@vistomail.com, and praised the network's ability to process more transactions per second than any financial instrument, adding that Bitcoin is a huge success and will continue to scale.However, concerns have arisen regarding the domain vistomail.com, as it appears that the domain may have changed ownership. This has led to worries that scammers may use the domain to impersonate Satoshi. Peter Todd suggested blocking the entire domain from the list to mitigate this risk.In response, Satoshi clarified that the ownership of vistomail.com has not changed since he registered it. The recent update in the ownership information on who.is was simply an extension of the registration period, as the domain was set to expire. Despite observing arguments and comments on Twitter, Satoshi emphasized that he remains aware of everything and believes that valuable time and effort should be dedicated to working rather than arguing.To prevent Craig Wright from making false claims as the creator of Bitcoin and suing others, Satoshi added satoshin@vistomail.com and contact@vistomail.com as lightning addresses. Satoshi also expressed gratitude to the Lightning team for their excellent work in creating a global business platform with fast and secure lightning payments. Additionally, Satoshi included his lightning address on contact@secureanonymoussurfing.com to acknowledge the team further.Peter Todd responded to Satoshi's email, mentioning that vistomail.com appeared to have changed ownership based on updated whois records and website content. He recommended blocking the entire domain, assuming it to be another scammer pretending to be Satoshi.In conclusion, Satoshi commended the Lightning Network for its achievements in facilitating global business with fast and secure lightning payments. Bitcoin's success and scalability surpass traditional banking systems, as it can process a higher number of transactions per second.</summary>
