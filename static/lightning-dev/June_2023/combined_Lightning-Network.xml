    <summary>In response to Peter Todd's statement about the domain vistomail.com, Satoshi Nakamoto clarified that the domain has not changed hands since he registered it. The update on who.is regarding the purchase of additional years of ownership was made by Satoshi himself to prevent the domain from expiring. Despite Peter's smart ass comments and constant arguments on Twitter, Satoshi emphasized the need to stop arguing and work harder. He also mentioned that Peter's attempt to start an argument has resulted in his ability to submit posts being stopped in certain developer forums.Satoshi further added that he has added lightning addresses (satoshin@vistomail.com and contact@vistomail.com) to combat Craig Wright's attempts to sue everyone and pretend to be the creator of Bitcoin. He acknowledged Cobra and Hodlonaut for holding their own against Craig Wright and expressed that he has many other ways to prove his identity as the real Satoshi, although he never cared to do so because he knows he is the real one. Satoshi stated that he saw all the messages, including Peter's, and appreciated the work of the Lightning team, calling it a great achievement and thanking them for making him feel welcomed.In conclusion, Satoshi Nakamoto praised the Lightning Network for its ability to facilitate global business with fast and secure lightning payments. He created a lightning address at satoshi@vistomail.com and commended the network for processing more transactions per second than any financial instrument. However, concerns were raised about the change in ownership of the vistomail.com domain, leading to suggestions from Peter Todd to block the entire domain from the list due to potential scammer activity pretending to be Satoshi.</summary>
