    <summary>Satoshi Nakamoto has created a lightning address, satoshi at vistomail.com, and expressed his satisfaction with the Lightning Network's ability to facilitate global business with fast and secure payments. He praised the network's ability to process more transactions per second than traditional banking systems, calling Bitcoin a huge success that will continue to scale. However, there are concerns about the ownership of Vistomail, as Peter Todd suggested blocking the entire domain from the list due to recent changes in who.is records and website content. Satoshi Nakamoto added his lightning address to contact at secureanonymoussurfing.com and thanked the Lightning team for their work, saying that they are light years ahead of traditional banking systems.</summary>
