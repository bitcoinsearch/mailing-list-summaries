    <summary>Satoshi Nakamoto has expressed his satisfaction with the Lightning Network as a means of conducting global business with fast and secure lightning payments. In an email dated June 3, 2023, he created a new lightning address, satoshi@vistomail.com, and praised the network's ability to process more transactions per second than any financial instrument, adding that Bitcoin is a huge success and will continue to scale. The Lightning Network's ability to process more transactions per second than traditional banking systems puts it light years ahead of them. However, there were concerns that the domain vistomail.com had changed ownership recently, leading to suspicions that it may be used by scammers pretending to be Satoshi. Peter Todd suggested blocking the entire domain from the list. Nevertheless, Satoshi Nakamoto clarified that the domain had not changed hands since he registered it, and that what appeared to be a purchase update (added years) on who.is was simply an addition to ownership because the domain was set to expire. He also added satoshin at vistomail.com and contact at vistomail.com as lightning addresses just so Craig Wright would stop trying to sue everyone and pretend he is the creator of Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto claimed to have seen all the messages, including those from Peter, and stated that he was just giving a compliment to the Lightning team for their excellent work.</summary>
