    <summary>In a proposal to the Lightning-dev mailing list, Thomas Voegtlin suggests an extension to BOLT-11, the Lightning Network invoice specification. The proposed extension would allow invoices to contain two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts. This feature would benefit services that require prepayment of a mining fee for non-custodian exchanges such as submarine swaps and JIT channels.Currently, services like Loop by Lightning Labs can ask for a prepayment because their dedicated software can handle it. However, competitors like the Boltz exchange, which do not require a dedicated wallet, find it impractical to show two invoices simultaneously. This leaves them vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks where attackers force them to pay on-chain fees.Similarly, in the case of JIT channels, providers need to protect themselves against mining fee attacks. They ask for the preimage of the main payment before opening the channel, but this makes them custodians from a legal perspective. This exclusionary situation prevents competitors like Electrum, who refuse to offer custodian services, from participating.To solve these issues, Voegtlin proposes bundling the prepayment and main payment in the same BOLT-11 invoice. The proposal outlines the semantics of bundled payments, including waiting for all HTLCs of both payments to arrive before fulfilling the pre-payment HTLCs. If the main payment does not arrive, the pre-payment is failed with a MPP timeout. Once both payments' HTLCs have arrived, the receiver fulfills the prepayment HTLCs and broadcasts the on-chain transaction.Voegtlin acknowledges that the proposal doesn't prevent service providers from stealing the prepayment, but this is already a risk today. He believes implementing this change in BOLT-11 rather than using BOLT-12 or onion messages would simplify the process as it does not require the exchange of new messages.Overall, Voegtlin's proposal aims to level the playing field for competition among Lightning service providers and enable non-custodian services like Phoenix's pay-to-open to comply with European regulations. The proposal has been shared with the Lightning-dev community for feedback and discussion.</summary>
