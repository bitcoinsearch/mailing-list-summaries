    <summary>Thomas Voegtlin has proposed an extension to BOLT-11 which would allow invoices to contain two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts. This is aimed at services that require a prepayment of a mining fee for a non-custodial exchange to take place, such as submarine swaps and JIT channels. Currently, some service providers are vulnerable to DoS attacks where the attacker forces them to pay on-chain fees. While some providers can ask for a prepayment, others cannot do so without dedicated software. The proposal would level the field in terms of competition between lightning service providers and would also make it possible for ACINQ to make their pay-to-open service fully non-custodial. The proposal does not require the exchange of new messages and can be implemented in BOLT-11.</summary>
