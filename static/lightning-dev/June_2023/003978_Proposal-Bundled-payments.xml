    <title>Proposal: Bundled payments</title>

    <summary>Thomas Voegtlin proposed an extension to BOLT-11 where an invoice can contain two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts. The use case is for services that require the prepayment of a mining fee in order for a non-custodian exchange to take place, such as submarine swaps and JIT channels. Currently, competitors who do not require a dedicated wallet cannot ask for a prepayment, making them vulnerable to DoS attacks. In addition, providers who want to protect themselves against this mining fee attack need to ask the preimage of the main payment before they open the channel, which makes their service custodian. To solve this issue, it would be beneficial to bundle the prepayment and the main payment in the same BOLT-11 invoice. This proposal would level the field in terms of competition between lightning service providers and make it possible for them to make their pay-to-open service fully non-custodian. Thomas believes that such a change should be implemented in BOLT-11, and not using BOLT-12 or onion messages.</summary>
