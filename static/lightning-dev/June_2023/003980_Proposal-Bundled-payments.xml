    <summary>The proposal put forward by Thomas Voegtlin suggests an extension to BOLT-11, the Lightning Network protocol, to include two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts. The purpose of this extension is to address the need for prepayment of mining fees in services such as submarine swaps and JIT channels. In these cases, service providers receive HTLCs for which they don't have the preimage and need to send funds on-chain while waiting for the client to reveal the preimage.Currently, some services like Loop by Lightning Labs can ask for a prepayment because their software can handle it. However, competitors who don't require a dedicated wallet, like the Boltz exchange, face vulnerabilities to DoS attacks where attackers force them to pay on-chain fees. Similarly, providers of JIT channels who want to protect themselves against mining fee attacks need to ask for the preimage of the main payment before opening the channel. This, however, makes them custodians from a legal perspective and exposes them to regulations like MICA in Europe.To solve these issues, Voegtlin proposes bundling the prepayment and main payment in the same BOLT-11 invoice. The semantics of bundled payments would involve the receiver waiting for all HTLCs of both payments to arrive before fulfilling the HTLCs of the pre-payment. If the main payment doesn't arrive, the pre-payment should fail with a MPP timeout. Once the HTLCs of both payments have arrived, the receiver fulfills the HTLCs of the prepayment and broadcasts their on-chain transaction.Voegtlin acknowledges that this proposal doesn't prevent service providers from stealing the pre-payment, but argues that this is already possible under the current system. He believes that implementing this change in BOLT-11, rather than using new protocols like BOLT-12 or onion messages, would simplify the process as it doesn't require the exchange of new messages.Overall, Voegtlin suggests that this extension to BOLT-11 would level the playing field for competition between lightning service providers and provide benefits such as enabling ACINQ to offer a fully non-custodian pay-to-open service. He emphasizes the importance of considering regulations like MICA and believes that this change can be implemented in a non-interactive way without adding unnecessary complexity.</summary>
