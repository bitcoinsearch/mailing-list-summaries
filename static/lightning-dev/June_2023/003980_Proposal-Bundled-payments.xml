    <title>Proposal: Bundled payments</title>

    <summary>The proposal is for an extension to BOLT-11 that allows for two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts in one invoice. This has use cases for services that require prepayment of mining fees, such as submarine swaps and JIT channels. Currently, some service providers are vulnerable to DoS attacks or forced to offer custodian services due to the need for prepayment. The semantics of bundled payments would require the receiver to wait until all HTLCs of both payments have arrived before fulfilling the HTLC of the pre-payment. This proposal would level the field in terms of competition between lightning service providers and could benefit ACINQ and its pay-to-open service. ThomasV believes this change should be implemented in BOLT-11 instead of using BOLT-12 or onion messages because it does not require the exchange of new messages and can be done in a non-interactive way. However, there are concerns that introducing yet another incompatible version of BOLT-11 may not be likely given the current lack of broad support for amount-less BOLT-11 invoices.</summary>
