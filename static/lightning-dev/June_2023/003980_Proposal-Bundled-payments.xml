    <title>Proposal: Bundled payments</title>

    <summary>Matt, a member of the Lightning Network community, expressed in an email that it is unlikely to have any new interoperable changes in BOLT-11. He pointed out that amount-less BOLT-11 invoices are not broadly supported, and rolling out another incompatible version seems unlikely to get ecosystem support. In contrast, Thomas Voegtlin proposed an extension to BOLT-11 where an invoice can contain two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts. This would address issues for services that require prepayment of a mining fee before non-custodian exchanges take place such as submarine swaps and JIT channels. By bundling prepayment and main payment into one BOLT-11 invoice, service providers would be able to compete on equal footing without being exposed to mining fee attacks. Voegtlin believes this proposal should be implemented in BOLT-11 rather than using BOLT-12 or onion messages.</summary>
