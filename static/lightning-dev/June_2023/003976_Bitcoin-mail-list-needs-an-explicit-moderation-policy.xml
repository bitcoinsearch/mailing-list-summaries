    <summary>In a post to the bitcoin-dev mail list, Dr. Maxim Orlovsky expressed his concern about potential censorship and sent a CC to the lightning-dev mail list as well to ensure the publication of his letter. He mentioned that he had previously contributed to the bitcoin community and received support from known community members. However, he noticed that while other emails were being released, his email was not. This led him to inquire about his post and sparked a conversation on Twitter with Bryan Bishop, the current moderator.From the Twitter conversation shared in Annex A, it became evident that there is a lack of clear explicit moderation policies on the bitcoin-dev mail list. Orlovsky proposed several suggestions to address this issue. Firstly, he suggested implementing a clear moderation or pre-publication peer-review policy that would be discussed and agreed upon by the mail list participants. Secondly, he proposed replacing Bryan Bishop as the moderator and selecting a new moderator from a list of potential candidates based on the criteria of "least votes against." He emphasized that the role of the moderator(s) should be purely executive without personal preferences. Additionally, Orlovsky suggested creating a dedicated mail list called "bitcoin-dev-unmoderated" where all submissions would be published without moderation. This list would allow people interested in non-censored content to read it, and any instances of non-spam emails being censored could be publicly announced, leading to the removal and replacement of failing moderators. Lastly, Orlovsky proposed that the incentive to work as a moderator should be reputation-based.In conclusion, Dr. Maxim Orlovsky raised concerns about the lack of clear moderation policies on the bitcoin-dev mail list and proposed several suggestions to address these issues. He CCed the lightning-dev mail list to ensure the publication of his letter and engaged in a discussion on Twitter with Bryan Bishop about the matter. The full context and the Twitter conversation can be found in the provided links.</summary>
