    <summary>Dr. Maxim Orlovsky, a contributor to the Bitcoin community, sent a post to the bitcoin-dev mail list about a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol. Despite receiving support from known community members and not containing any scam promotion, his post was not published while other emails were released. Concerned about potential censorship, Dr. Orlovsky questioned whether his post reached the moderator, Bryan Bishop.In a Twitter conversation provided in Annex A, it became evident that the bitcoin-dev mail list lacked clear explicit moderation policies and that Bryan Bishop had abused his powers based on personal preferences. The post was eventually published after a requirement from Peter Todd.To address these issues, Dr. Orlovsky proposed several solutions. Firstly, he suggested implementing a clear moderation or pre-publication peer-review policy for the bitcoin-dev mail list. Secondly, he proposed replacing Bryan Bishop, the current moderator, with someone selected from a list of potential candidates based on the criteria of "least votes against." Dr. Orlovsky emphasized that moderators should strictly adhere to the established policies without personal preferences. Additionally, he recommended creating a dedicated mail list called "bitcoin-dev-unmoderated" where all submissions would be published without moderation. This list would allow interested individuals to audit the main bitcoin-dev mail list for non-censorship. If any non-spam emails were found to be censored, the failing moderator(s) would be replaced. Lastly, Dr. Orlovsky suggested that the incentive for working as a moderator should be reputation-based.In conclusion, Dr. Orlovsky highlighted the lack of clear moderation policies and the abuse of power by the current moderator, urging for changes to ensure fair and inclusive discussions within the bitcoin-dev mail list.</summary>
