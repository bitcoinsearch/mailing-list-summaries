    <summary>In a post to the bitcoin-dev mail list, Dr. Maxim Orlovsky expressed concern about potential censorship and sent a copy to the lightning-dev mail list as well. He had previously sent a post referencing a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol that received positive feedback from the community. Despite being a known contributor to the community, his post did not get published while others did. This prompted him to question whether his post had reached the moderator, Bryan Bishop. Dr. Orlovsky shared a Twitter conversation (Annex A) highlighting the lack of clear moderation policies and the abuse of power by the current moderator. He proposed several solutions, including the implementation of a clear moderation policy, replacing Bryan Bishop as moderator, and creating a dedicated unmoderated mail list for auditing purposes. The role of the moderator should be purely executive without personal preferences, and reputation-based incentives should be introduced. Dr. Orlovsky concludes by resting his case. The context includes links to relevant information such as the publication of the new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol, Dr. Orlovsky's previous contributions to the community, and the Twitter conversation regarding the moderation issue.</summary>
