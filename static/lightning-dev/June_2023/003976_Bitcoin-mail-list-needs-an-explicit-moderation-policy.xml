    <summary>On June 3, 2023, Dr Maxim Orlovsky sent an email to the bitcoin-dev mail list regarding the publication of a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol. After noticing that other emails were being released to the mail list while his was not, he started asking questions about whether his post had been received by the moderator. From the conversation on Twitter (Annex A), it became clear that the bitcoin-dev mail list lacked clear explicit moderation policies, and Bryan Bishop, the current moderator, had abused his powers based on personal likes or dislikes. Therefore, Dr Orlovsky proposed a few solutions, including creating a clear moderation policy, replacing the current moderator, and dedicating a mail list for non-moderated submissions to ensure transparency. The proposal was intended to prevent potential censorship and make the entire process more efficient.</summary>
