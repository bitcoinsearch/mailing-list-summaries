    <title>Bitcoin mail list needs an explicit moderation policy</title>

    <summary>Dr. Maxim Orlovsky proposed a clear moderation policy for the bitcoin-dev mail list after his post went unpublished despite having support from known community members like Giacomo Zucco. The post referenced the new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol, which had already received broad positive reactions across the bitcoin community with no critical/negative responses after ~25k of reads. Orlovsky suggested that the bitcoin-dev mail list must have a clear moderation (or pre-publication peer-review policy) that should be proposed and discussed in the mail list and become public and obligatory upon agreement. He also suggested appreciating Bryan Bishop's unpaid work as a moderator, replacing him with a new moderator selected from a list of potential candidates using the criteria "least votes against," and creating a dedicated mail list called "bitcoin-dev-unmoderated," which would publish all submissions without moderation.</summary>
