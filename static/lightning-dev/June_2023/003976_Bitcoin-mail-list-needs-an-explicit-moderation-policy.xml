    <summary>Dr. Maxim Orlovsky recently sent a post to the bitcoin-dev mail list referencing the publication of a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol, which received positive reactions from the community. Despite his credentials and the support he received, his post was not published while other emails were. This prompted him to ask if his post reached the moderator, Bryan Bishop. Dr. Orlovsky shared a conversation on Twitter that highlighted the lack of clear moderation policies on the bitcoin-dev mail list and the abuse of power by the current moderator. He proposed implementing clear moderation policies, appreciating Bishop's work but replacing him with a new moderator, creating an unmoderated mail list for non-censored submissions, and making the role of the moderator purely executive without personal preferences. Dr. Orlovsky concludes by restating his case and providing links to relevant sources.In the conversation shared by Dr. Orlovsky, @kanzure questioned why their submission hadn't been approved and mentioned the requirement for peer review. The response from the moderator, Bryan Bishop, indicated boredom and unwillingness to approve the email due to the author's behavior. This sparked a discussion about the lack of clear moderation policies and the need for explicit guidelines rather than personal preferences.Overall, Dr. Orlovsky calls for the establishment of clear moderation policies in the bitcoin-dev mail list, suggesting the replacement of the current moderator, creation of an unmoderated mail list, and reputation-based incentives for moderators. He believes that moderation should be based on content quality rather than personal likes or dislikes.</summary>
