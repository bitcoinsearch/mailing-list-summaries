    <summary>Dr. Maxim Orlovsky, a known contributor to the Bitcoin community, wrote a letter to the bitcoin-dev mail list about a new protocol and sent a CC to the lightning-dev mail list to prevent potential censorship. However, he noticed that his post wasn't released to the mail list while other emails were. He proposed that the bitcoin-dev mail list should have clear moderation policies and suggested that the role of moderator(s) should be purely executive of the policies, without any personal preferences. He also proposed that a dedicated mail list should be created for non-censorship, which will publish all submissions without moderation. Furthermore, he suggested that the incentive to work as a moderator should be reputation-based. In Annex A, Dr. Maxim Orlovsky shared a conversation with Bryan Bishop, the current moderator, in which he realized that the bitcoin-dev mail list lacks explicit moderation policy and had abused his powers in achieving his agenda based on personal likes or dislikes.</summary>
