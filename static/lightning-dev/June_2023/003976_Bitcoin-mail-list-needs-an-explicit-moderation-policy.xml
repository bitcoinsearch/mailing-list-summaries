    <summary>Dr. Maxim Orlovsky, a known contributor to the Bitcoin community, wrote an email to the bitcoin-dev mail list referencing the publication of a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol. However, his post was not released while other emails were getting published. Orlovsky states that he believes the moderator, Bryan Bishop, abused his powers by publishing only those posts that he personally liked. Orlovsky suggests that there should be a clear moderation policy for the bitcoin-dev mail list, and the role of the moderator should be purely executive, without any personal preferences. He also proposes that a dedicated mail list should be created where all submissions will be published without moderation. Additionally, the incentive for working as a moderator should be reputation-based. In conclusion, Orlovsky requests that there be a change in policy to prevent potential censorship and ensure equal treatment of all contributors.</summary>
