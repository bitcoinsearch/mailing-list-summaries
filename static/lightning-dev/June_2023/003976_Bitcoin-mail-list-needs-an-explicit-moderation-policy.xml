    <summary>In a post to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Dr. Maxim Orlovsky expressed concern about potential censorship and sent a CC to the lightning-dev mailing list to ensure his message would be published. He had previously sent a post referencing a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol that had received positive feedback from the community. Despite his contributions to the community and support from well-known members, his post was not published while others were. This prompted him to question whether his post reached the moderator, Bryan Bishop.Dr. Orlovsky shared a conversation on Twitter to highlight the lack of clear moderation or peer-review policies on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. He believed that Bryan Bishop abused his powers as the moderator based on personal preferences. Eventually, Peter Todd intervened and the post was published.As a solution, Dr. Orlovsky proposed implementing clear moderation or pre-publication peer-review policies for the bitcoin-dev mailing list. He suggested replacing Bryan Bishop with a new moderator selected from a list of potential candidates. The role of the moderator should be purely executive without personal preferences. Additionally, he proposed creating a dedicated mail list called "bitcoin-dev-unmoderated" where all submissions would be published without moderation. This would allow interested individuals to audit the main mailing list and publicly announce any instances of non-spam emails being censored. Reputation-based incentives for moderators were also suggested.Dr. Orlovsky concluded his message by restating his case and signing off.In Annex A, a conversation between Dr. Orlovsky and @kanzure revealed the lack of clarity regarding review procedures for getting emails published on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. Dr. Orlovsky criticized the lack of an explicit moderation policy and expressed disappointment in the way he was treated.Overall, Dr. Orlovsky highlighted the need for clear moderation policies, unbiased moderators, and an open discussion within the community to address these issues.</summary>
