    <summary>Dear community,Dr Maxim Orlovsky, a known contributor to the bitcoin community, has written an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list regarding the publication of a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol. Despite receiving support from community members and having no scam promotion, his post was not published on the mailing list. This has raised concerns about the lack of clear moderation policies and potential abuse of power by the current moderator, Bryan Bishop.In light of these issues, Dr Maxim Orlovsky proposes several solutions. Firstly, he suggests implementing a clear moderation or pre-publication peer-review policy for the bitcoin-dev mailing list, which can be discussed and agreed upon by the community. Secondly, he recommends replacing Bryan Bishop as the moderator and selecting a new moderator from a list of potential candidates using the criteria of "least votes against." The role of the moderator should be purely executive, without personal preferences.Furthermore, Dr Maxim Orlovsky suggests creating a dedicated mail list called "bitcoin-dev-unmoderated" where all submissions are published without moderation. This would allow interested individuals to audit the bitcoin-dev main mailing list for non-censorship. If any non-spam emails are found to be censored, the failing moderator(s) should be removed and replaced. The incentive to work as a moderator should be based on reputation.Dr Maxim Orlovsky concludes his proposal and provides links to relevant information, including the Twitter conversation highlighting the problem he wishes to address. He urges the community to consider his suggestions and address the lack of clear moderation policies on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.Kind regards,Maxim OrlovskyLinks:[1] Tweet about the publication of the new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol: [link][2] Dr Maxim Orlovsky's previous contributions to the bitcoin community: [links][3] Rust lightning implementation named LNP: [link][4] Bitcoin libraries and software developed by Dr Maxim Orlovsky: [links][5] Contributors to rust-bitcoin: [link][6] Support from Giacomo Zucco: [links][7] Bryan Bishop's familiarity with Dr Maxim Orlovsky: [link][8] Transcript of Dr Maxim Orlovsky's presentation at Scaling Bitcoin: [link][9] Requirement from Peter Todd for the post to be published: [link]Annex A:The annex provides a Twitter conversation between Dr Maxim Orlovsky and @kanzure, discussing the lack of explicit moderation policies on the bitcoin-dev mailing list and the requirement for peer review.</summary>
