    <summary>In a recent email sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Dr. Maxim Orlovsky expressed his concern about potential censorship and lack of clear moderation policies. He mentioned that despite his previous contributions to the community and the support he received for his post on the new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol, his email was not published while others were. Orlovsky speculated that this could be due to the stricter rules for creating new topics compared to replying to existing ones. He noted that starting a new topic requires more effort and can upset some readers who are not interested in it. However, gradually shifting the discussion from an existing topic into something else is more acceptable.Orlovsky shared a conversation on Twitter that he had with Bryan Bishop, the current moderator of the bitcoin-dev mailing list. From the conversation, it became evident that there were no clear explicit moderation or peer-review policies in place, and Bishop had allegedly abused his powers based on personal preferences. Orlovsky proposed several solutions to address these issues, including implementing clear moderation or pre-publication peer-review policies, replacing Bishop as the moderator through a selection process, and creating a separate unmoderated mailing list for all submissions. He suggested that the incentive for being a moderator should be reputation-based.Orlovsky concluded his email by emphasizing the need for clear moderation policies and expressing his hope that the bitcoin-dev mailing list would consider his proposals. The email included various links to additional information about Orlovsky's previous contributions and the Twitter conversation with Bishop.Overall, Orlovsky raised concerns about the lack of clear moderation policies and the possible abuse of power by the current moderator of the bitcoin-dev mailing list. He proposed solutions to address these issues and called for the implementation of fair and transparent moderation practices within the community.</summary>
