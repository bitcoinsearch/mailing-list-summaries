    <summary>In an email exchange between Thomas Voegtlin and Dave, they discuss the semantics of bundled payments. According to Thomas, a BOLT-11 invoice in bundled payments contains two preimages and two amounts: a prepayment and a main payment. The receiver is instructed to wait until all the HTLCs (Hash Time Locked Contracts) of both payments have arrived before fulfilling the HTLCs of the pre-payment. If the main payment does not arrive, the pre-payment should be failed with a MPP (Multi-Path Payment) timeout. Once the HTLCs of both payments have arrived, the receiver fulfills the HTLCs of the prepayment and broadcasts their on-chain transaction. It's important to note that the main payment can still fail if the sender never reveals the preimage of the main payment.Dave raises a question about whether a BOLT11 invoice should contain a payment hash for the prepayment or if it would be acceptable to use a keysend payment with an onion message payload indicating what payment hash to associate with the prepayment. For example, if Alice wants to receive 1 BTC to a specific hash, she could send a keysend payment with metadata indicating that the receiver shouldn't claim the prepayment until they receive the 1 BTC HTLC associated with that hash. Dave suggests extending BOLT11 invoices with an "extra_fee_via_keysend" field, which would be smaller and allow for encoding in existing BOLT11 fields like the description or metadata field. This approach could allow for immediate implementation until an updated version of BOLT11 or an alternative using offers becomes widely deployed.Overall, the discussion revolves around the semantics of bundled payments in BOLT11 invoices and the possibility of using keysend payments with additional metadata to facilitate the process.</summary>
