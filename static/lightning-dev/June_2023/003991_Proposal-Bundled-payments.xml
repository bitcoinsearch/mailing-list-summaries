    <summary>On June 20th, 2023, Thomas Voegtlin wrote to discuss the implementation of BOLT-12 in Electrum. According to him, bundled payments would not work as specified, but BOLT12 offers are reusable. Thomas also stated that it will take years for BOLT-12 to become the dominant payment method on Lightning. However, if the feature was adopted in BOLT-11, it could be deployed much faster. He proposed to level the field of competition between Lightning service providers by allowing reverse submarine swap payments to come from any wallet. Matt expressed his confusion over this proposal, stating that it only makes sense if the user has an on-chain wallet they want to use, which is distinct from their lightning wallet.</summary>
