    <summary>In an email conversation between Thomas Voegtlin and Matt, the topic of implementing BOLT-12 in Electrum is discussed. Thomas asks if bundled payments would work with the current BOLT-12 specification or if it would require changes. Matt responds by saying that as-specified, bundled payments would not work, but because BOLT12 offers are reusable, it would be possible to scan a single offer and send two payments as long as the sender implements this feature.Thomas expresses his intention to implement BOLT-12 support in Electrum in the coming months and offers his help. Matt is glad to hear this news and agrees that it will take years for BOLT-12 to become the dominant payment method on Lightning. However, he believes that if this feature was adopted in BOLT-11, it could be deployed much faster.Matt explains that while BOLT-12 has some time to go before gaining widespread adoption, a new BOLT-11 extension would have to start from scratch with zero implementations and would need to convince people to care enough to implement it. With BOLT-12, a client that is "swap-aware" can perform the necessary actions without the need for scanning multiple QR codes or complicated processes.The goal of Thomas' proposal is to level the field of competition between Lightning service providers by allowing reverse submarine swap payments to come from any wallet. However, it is noted that a dedicated client would still be needed to verify the redeem script and the invoice, as well as sweep the funds. Matt admits that he struggles to see the value in this proposal, as it seems to have a narrow set of requirements that may not align with most users' needs.Overall, the discussion focuses on the implementation of BOLT-12 in Electrum and the potential benefits and challenges associated with bundled payments and reverse submarine swap payments.</summary>
