    <summary>In an email conversation between Thomas Voegtlin and Matt, they discussed the implementation of BOLT-12 in Electrum. Thomas asked if bundled payments would work with the current specification or if changes would be required. Matt clarified that as specified, bundled payments would not work, but because BOLT12 offers are reusable, it would be possible to scan a single offer and send two payments as long as the sender implements this. Matt also mentioned that they plan to implement BOLT-12 support in Electrum in the coming months.Thomas expressed his belief that it would take years for BOLT-12 to become the dominant payment method on Lightning after it is merged. Matt agreed with this statement. However, Matt suggested that if the feature was adopted in BOLT-11 instead, it could be deployed much faster. He explained that while BOLT-12 still has some way to go in terms of gaining traction, a new BOLT-11 extension would need to start from scratch and convince people to implement it.Matt also mentioned the goal of his proposal, which is to level the field of competition between Lightning service providers by allowing reverse submarine swap payments to come from any wallet. However, he admitted that he struggled to see the value in this proposal, as it requires a "swap-aware" client for setup and enforcement, but allows any lightning wallet to make the payment. He noted that it would only make sense if the user wants to use an on-chain wallet separate from their lightning wallet and if their lightning wallet does not support splice-out.Overall, the email conversation focused on the implementation and potential impact of BOLT-12 in Electrum, as well as the advantages and challenges associated with bundled payments and reverse submarine swap payments.</summary>
