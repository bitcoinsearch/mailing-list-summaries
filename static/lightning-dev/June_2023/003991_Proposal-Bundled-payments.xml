    <summary>In a recent communication, Thomas Voegtlin, the developer of Electrum, mentioned that BOLT-12 has not been implemented in the software yet. He asked if bundled payments would work with the current specification or if changes to BOLT-12 would be required. The response was that bundled payments will not work as specified, but BOLT12 offers are reusable, allowing for the scanning of a single offer and sending two payments, as long as the sender implements this feature.It was stated that Electrum plans to implement BOLT-12 support in the coming months, and assistance would be provided in this regard. The belief is that it will take years after the merge for BOLT-12 to become the dominant payment method on Lightning. However, if this feature were adopted in BOLT-11, deployment could be much faster.The proposal aims to level the field of competition between Lightning service providers by enabling reverse submarine swap payments from any wallet. It is important to note that a dedicated client will still be needed to verify the redeem script and the invoice, as well as to sweep the funds. However, it was acknowledged that this proposal may have limited value, as it requires a "swap-aware" client for setup and enforcement, and only makes sense if the user has an on-chain wallet separate from their lightning wallet.Overall, the discussion focused on the implementation and potential impact of BOLT-12 in Electrum, as well as the advantages and limitations of utilizing bundled payments and reverse submarine swaps.</summary>
