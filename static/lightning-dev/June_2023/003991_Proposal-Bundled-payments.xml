    <summary>In a recent conversation between Thomas Voegtlin and Matt, the topic of implementing BOLT-12 in Electrum was discussed. Thomas asked whether bundled payments would work with the current BOLT-12 specification or if changes would be required. Matt explained that while bundled payments will not work as-specified, BOLT12 offers are reusable, so it would be possible to scan a single offer and send two payments as long as the sender implements this feature.Matt also mentioned that Electrum plans to implement BOLT-12 support in the coming months and expressed his willingness to assist with this. Thomas responded positively to this news.The conversation then shifted to the potential adoption of BOLT-12 as the dominant payment method on Lightning. Both agreed that it would likely take years after its merger for BOLT-12 to gain widespread acceptance. However, Matt suggested that if this feature was adopted in BOLT-11 instead, it could be deployed more quickly. He explained that BOLT-12 still needs time to gain traction, whereas a new BOLT-11 extension would have to start from scratch with zero implementations and would require convincing people to prioritize its implementation.Matt further noted that with BOLT-12, a client that is "swap-aware" would not need to scan two QR codes or perform any complicated steps. This simplifies the process for users. Thomas then explained that his proposal aims to level the playing field for Lightning service providers by allowing reverse submarine swap payments to come from any wallet. However, he acknowledged that a dedicated client would still be needed to verify the redeem script and the invoice, as well as sweep the funds.Matt admitted that he struggled to see the value in this proposal. He pointed out that the user would need a "swap-aware" client to handle the setup and enforcement of the swap but could use any lightning wallet to make the payment. Thus, it only makes sense if the user has a separate on-chain wallet they want to use, which is distinct from their lightning wallet.Overall, the conversation covered the potential implementation of BOLT-12 in Electrum, the timeline for its adoption, the benefits of bundling payments, and the challenges associated with reverse submarine swap payments.</summary>
