    <summary>In an email exchange between Thomas Voegtlin and Matt, they discuss the implementation of BOLT-12 in Electrum. Thomas asks if bundled payments would work with the current specification or require changes to BOLT-12. Matt explains that as-specified, bundled payments would not work, but because BOLT-12 offers are reusable, it would be possible to scan a single offer and send two payments as long as the sender implements this feature.Thomas expresses his intention to implement BOLT-12 support in Electrum in the coming months and offers his assistance. Matt responds positively to this news. They both agree that it will take years for BOLT-12 to become the dominant payment method on Lightning. However, Matt suggests that if the feature was adopted in BOLT-11, it could be deployed much faster.Matt clarifies his reasoning by explaining that while BOLT-12 still has some way to go in terms of gaining traction, a new BOLT-11 extension would have to start from scratch with zero implementations and would need to convince people to care enough to implement it. With BOLT-12, a client that is "swap-aware" eliminates the need to scan two QR codes or perform any complicated processes.The goal of Thomas' proposal is to level the field of competition between Lightning service providers by allowing reverse submarine swap payments to come from any wallet. However, Matt admits that he struggles to see the value in this approach. He believes it only makes sense if the user has an on-chain wallet separate from their lightning wallet and their lightning wallet does not support splice-out. Matt considers these requirements to be quite narrow.Overall, the discussion revolves around the implementation of BOLT-12 in Electrum, its potential benefits and challenges, and the comparison between BOLT-11 and BOLT-12 in terms of adoption speed and usability.</summary>
