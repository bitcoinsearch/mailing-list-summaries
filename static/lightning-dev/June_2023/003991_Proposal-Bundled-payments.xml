    <summary>In an email exchange between Thomas Voegtlin and Matt, it was revealed that Electrum has not yet implemented BOLT-12. Thomas inquired whether bundled payments would work with the current specification or if changes to BOLT-12 would be required. Matt explained that while bundled payments would not work as specified, BOLT12 offers are reusable, allowing for the scanning of a single offer and sending two payments as long as the sender implements this feature.Thomas expressed his intention to implement BOLT-12 support in Electrum in the coming months and offered his assistance. Matt responded positively to this development. However, he believed that even after its implementation, it would take years for BOLT-12 to become the dominant payment method on Lightning. On the other hand, he suggested that if this feature was adopted in BOLT-11, it could be deployed much faster.Matt was uncertain about the reasoning behind this suggestion, pointing out that while BOLT-12 may still be in its early stages, a new BOLT-11 extension would have to start from scratch with zero implementations and the challenge of convincing people to care enough to implement it. He also highlighted the advantage of BOLT-12, where a "swap-aware" client eliminates the need for scanning multiple QR codes or performing complex procedures.The goal of Thomas's proposal was to level the field of competition among Lightning service providers by allowing reverse submarine swap payments from any wallet. However, Matt admitted to struggling to see the value in this approach. He noted that the user would need a "swap-aware" client for the setup and enforcement of the swap, but could use any lightning wallet to make the payment. This approach would only make sense if the user had a separate on-chain wallet that they wanted to utilize, which is distinct from their lightning wallet.Overall, the conversation revolved around the implementation of BOLT-12 in Electrum and the potential advantages and challenges associated with this approach.</summary>
