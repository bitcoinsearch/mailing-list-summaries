    <summary>In a recent conversation between Thomas Voegtlin and Matt, the implementation of BOLT-12 in Electrum was discussed. Thomas inquired whether bundled payments would work with the current specification or if changes to BOLT-12 were necessary. Matt explained that as specified, bundled payments would not work, but due to the reusability of BOLT12 offers, it would be possible to scan a single offer and send two payments as long as the sender implements this functionality.Thomas expressed his plan to implement BOLT-12 support in Electrum in the coming months and offered his assistance. Matt responded positively to this news. They both agreed that it would take some time for BOLT-12 to become the dominant payment method on Lightning, even after its implementation.Matt also stated that if the proposed feature was adopted in BOLT-11 instead, it could potentially be deployed much faster. He explained that while BOLT-12 still has progress to make, starting from zero with no current implementations, a new BOLT-11 extension would face the challenge of convincing people to care enough to implement it.Additionally, Matt mentioned that with a "swap-aware" client using BOLT-12, there would be no need to scan two QR codes or perform complex actions. The goal of Thomas's proposal is to level the field of competition among Lightning service providers by allowing reverse submarine swap payments to come from any wallet. However, he acknowledged that there are certain requirements for this to be feasible, such as the user having a distinct on-chain wallet separate from their lightning wallet.Overall, the discussion highlighted the potential benefits and challenges associated with implementing BOLT-12 and the importance of considering alternative approaches such as integrating the proposed feature into BOLT-11.</summary>
