    <summary>In a recent email exchange, Thomas Voegtlin, the creator of Electrum, mentioned that BOLT-12 has not been implemented in Electrum yet. He asked whether bundled payments would work with the current specification or if changes to BOLT-12 would be required. The response was that bundled payments would not work as specified, but because BOLT12 offers are reusable, it would be possible to scan a single offer and send two payments as long as the sender implements this feature.Thomas expressed his plans to implement BOLT-12 support in Electrum in the coming months and offered his assistance in this regard. The recipient of the email expressed their excitement about this development. They also agreed that it would take years for BOLT-12 to become the dominant payment method on Lightning once it is merged.However, they believed that if the proposed feature was adopted in BOLT-11 instead, it could be deployed much faster. They pointed out that while BOLT-12 still needed time to gain traction, a new BOLT-11 extension would have to start from scratch, without any existing implementations. It would also require convincing people to care enough to implement it.The goal of the proposal discussed in the email was to level the field of competition between Lightning service providers by allowing reverse submarine swap payments to come from any wallet. However, it was noted that a "swap-aware" client would still be needed to verify the redeem script and the invoice, as well as sweep the funds. The recipient of the email mentioned that they struggled to see the value in this proposal, as it seemed to cater to a narrow set of requirements where users had an on-chain wallet separate from their lightning wallet and their lightning wallet did not support splice-out.Overall, the email exchange highlighted the current status of BOLT-12 implementation in Electrum, potential challenges and benefits associated with bundled payments, and differing perspectives on the adoption and deployment of BOLT-12 and BOLT-11.</summary>
