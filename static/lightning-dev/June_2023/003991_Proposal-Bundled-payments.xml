    <summary>In a conversation between Thomas Voegtlin and Matt on 20th June, it was revealed that Electrum has not yet implemented BOLT-12. While bundled payments will not work with the current specification, the reusable nature of BOLT12 offers means that a single offer can be scanned and two payments sent by the sender. Thomas expressed his willingness to help with the implementation of BOLT-12 support in Electrum in the coming months. However, he also believes that even after the implementation, it will take years for BOLT-12 to become the dominant payment method on Lightning. Thomas added that if the feature was adopted in BOLT-11 instead of BOLT-12, it could be deployed much faster. However, Matt disagreed as BOLT-12 is already in the works and will be easier to implement than a new BOLT-11 extension that would require people to actually care enough to implement it. The goal of Thomas' proposal is to level the field of competition between Lightning service providers by allowing reverse submarine swap payments to come from any wallet. Although this requires a "swap-aware" client to do the swap setup and enforcement, any lightning wallet can pay it. However, this only makes sense if the user has an on-chain wallet they want to use which is distinct from their lightning wallet.</summary>
