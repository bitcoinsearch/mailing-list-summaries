    <summary>In a discussion between Thomas Voegtlin and Matt, it was mentioned that BOLT-12 has not been implemented in Electrum yet. Thomas inquired whether bundled payments would work with the current specification or if they would require changes to BOLT-12. Matt explained that bundled payments would not work as specified, but since BOLT12 offers are reusable, it would be possible to scan a single offer and send two payments as long as the sender implements this feature.Thomas informed Matt that BOLT-12 support will be implemented in Electrum in the coming months and he is willing to help with the process. Matt expressed his enthusiasm for this development. However, Thomas mentioned that even after merging, it would take years for BOLT-12 to become the dominant payment method on Lightning.In response to Thomas' suggestion of adopting this feature in BOLT-11, Matt was uncertain about its feasibility. He explained that while BOLT-12 still needs time to gain traction, a new BOLT-11 extension would need to start from scratch with zero implementations and face the challenge of convincing people to adopt it. Additionally, BOLT-12 allows for a more seamless user experience by eliminating the need to scan multiple QR codes or perform complex steps.The goal of Thomas' proposal is to level the playing field for Lightning service providers by enabling reverse submarine swap payments from any wallet. However, Matt expressed some skepticism about the value of this proposal, stating that it seems to cater to a narrow set of requirements where users have an on-chain wallet distinct from their lightning wallet and their lightning wallet does not support splice-out.Overall, the discussion revolves around the implementation of BOLT-12 in Electrum, the potential benefits and challenges associated with bundled payments, and the goals and considerations of Thomas' proposal for leveling the competition among Lightning service providers.</summary>
