    <summary>In an email conversation between Thomas Voegtlin and Bastien, the two discussed the possibility of combining pre-payment of the mining fee with 0-conf. Bastien clarified that he did not mean to suggest that these options were opposed to each other; rather, if for some reason 0-conf was no longer usable, then the solution described would not work and a prepayment would be necessary. When asked about whether bundled payments would work with the current specification or require changes to BOLT-12, Bastien explained that a TLV field would need to be added to Bolt 12 invoices or onion messages. He also noted that the design space for a prepayment solution based on Bolt 12 is larger than with Bolt 11, and that it could potentially lead to a more satisfying protocol. Regarding the adoption of BOLT-12, Bastien believed that it would take years after it is merged before it becomes the dominant payment method on Lightning. However, he also thought that if this feature was adopted in BOLT-11, it could be deployed much faster. The goal of his proposal is to level the playing field for competition among Lightning service providers. Thomas agreed that it would be great to have a more satisfying solution, but felt that it was not a reason to rush it. Ultimately, Bastien argued that it's worth trying to build a prepayment solution on top of BOLT-12, where something cleaner could be developed since invoices are delivered on-the-fly and are short-lived.</summary>
