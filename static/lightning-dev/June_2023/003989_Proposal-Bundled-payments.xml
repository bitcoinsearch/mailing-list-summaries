    <summary>In this conversation between Bastien and Thomas, they discuss the possibility of using pre-payment of mining fees in conjunction with 0-conf. Bastien clarifies that he did not mean to imply that pre-payment and 0-conf were opposed, but rather that if 0-conf were to be discontinued, pre-payment would become necessary. When asked about whether bundled payments would work with the current specification or require changes to BOLT-12, Bastien explains that it would require adding a TLV field to Bolt 12 invoices or onion messages. He believes there is more design space for a prepayment solution based on Bolt 12, which could result in a more satisfying protocol.Thomas expresses his belief that BOLT-12 may take years to become the dominant payment method on Lightning, while Bastien argues that it could be deployed much faster if it were adopted in BOLT-11. Bastien's proposal aims to level the field of competition between Lightning service providers. Thomas proposes a way to save space for the prepayment hash, but notes that an invoice feature bit would still be required. He suggests that subtracting the prepayment amount from the main payment amount could make the feature optional.David Harding joins the conversation and suggests that a keysend payment with metadata indicating what payment hash to associate with the prepayment could be used instead of a BOLT11 invoice. This would only require extending BOLT11 invoices with an extra_fee_via_keysend field, which could be encoded in existing fields such as description or metadata. Thomas's company Electrum Technologies GmbH is mentioned at the end of the conversation.</summary>
