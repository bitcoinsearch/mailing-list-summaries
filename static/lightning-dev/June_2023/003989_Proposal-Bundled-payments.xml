    <summary>Bastien, a developer, proposes to level the playing field of competition between Lightning service providers by creating a prepayment solution based on Bolt 12 protocol. Thomas, another developer, agrees with the idea but suggests that it would require adding a TLV field to Bolt 12 invoices or onion messages. David, another developer, suggests using a keysend payment with metadata indicating what payment hash to associate with the prepayment instead of a BOLT11 invoice containing a payment hash for the prepayment. Thomas thinks that it would be acceptable and would require an extra_fee_via_keysend field to be added in BOLT11 invoices. He also clarifies that if the feature were optional, the prepayment amount should be subtracted from the main payment amount. Bastien considers building this solution on top of Bolt 12, where they can probably do something cleaner since invoices are delivered on-the-fly and short-lived.</summary>
