He also criticized Peter for his smart ass comments and constant arguments on Twitter, urging him to stop arguing and work harder. Satoshi mentioned that he added satoshin at vistomail.com and contact at vistomail.com as lightning addresses to counter Craig Wright's attempts to sue people and claim to be the creator of Bitcoin.Satoshi claimed to have many other ways to prove that he is the real Satoshi but never cared to do so because he knows he is the real deal. He acknowledged reading all the messages, including Peter's, and added his lightning address to contact at secureanonymoussurfing.com as a compliment to the Lightning team for their excellent work.In response to Satoshi's email, Peter Todd pointed out that the whois records and website content for vistomail.com had recently changed, suggesting a change in ownership. He considered it another scammer pretending to be Satoshi and recommended blocking the entire domain.Overall, the exchange between Satoshi Nakamoto and Peter Todd revolved around the ownership of the vistomail.com domain and Satoshi's efforts to counter Craig Wright's claims as the creator of Bitcoin.</summary>
