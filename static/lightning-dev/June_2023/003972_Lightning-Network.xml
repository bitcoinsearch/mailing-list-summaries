    <summary>I wanted to provide additional validation to my account, so I am responding from my secureanonymoussurfing.com email address. I would like to clarify that the domain vistomail.com has not changed hands since I registered it. The update you see on who.is is simply me adding years to the ownership because the domain was set to expire. I thought you, Peter, might already know this. However, you always seem to make false statements and start arguments on Twitter with your smart comments. I can see everything. Despite having the greatest technology known to man, you still argue over everything. My advice is to stop arguing and work harder. It seems that the new developers no longer want me around, and I am completely fine with that.In addition, I have added satoshin at vistomail.com and contact at vistomail.com as lightning addresses. This was done to prevent Craig Wright from suing everyone and pretending to be the creator of Bitcoin. I have many other ways to prove that I am the real Satoshi, but I never cared enough because I know that I am the real Satoshi. I have seen all the messages, including yours, Peter. I also added my lightning address to contact at secureanonymoussurfing.com as a compliment to the Lightning team. They have done really great work, and I appreciate their efforts in making me feel welcomed.Satoshi NakamotoOn the other hand, Peter Todd had raised concerns about the ownership of the vistomail.com domain. He pointed out that the whois records and website content had recently been changed, suggesting a change in ownership. However, I have clarified that there has been no change in ownership and that I only added years to the ownership recently. Peter assumes that this is yet another scammer pretending to be Satoshi and suggests blocking the entire domain.It is important to note that there are attachments included in the email. One is a public key for contact at secureanonymoussurfing.com, and the other is an OpenPGP digital signature.</summary>
