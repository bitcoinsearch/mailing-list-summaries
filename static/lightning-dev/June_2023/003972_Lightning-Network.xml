    <summary>I am responding from my secureanonymoussurfing.com email address to provide further validation of my account. I want to clarify that the domain vistomail.com has not changed hands since I registered it. The update you see on who.is is simply an addition of years to the ownership, as the domain was set to expire. Despite your smart comments and constant arguments on Twitter, I know what I'm doing. You seem to argue over everything, even with the greatest technology known to man. Instead of arguing, I suggest you work harder. It's clear that the new developers no longer want me around, and I'm fine with that.In addition, I have added satoshin at vistomail.com and contact at vistomail.com as lightning addresses. This is to prevent Craig Wright from suing everyone and pretending to be the creator of Bitcoin. I have many other ways to prove that I am the real Satoshi, but I never cared to do so because I am the real Satoshi. I have seen all the messages, including yours, Peter. Furthermore, I added my lightning address to contact at secureanonymoussurfing.com as a compliment to the Lightning team. They have done excellent work, and I thank them for making me feel welcomed.Peter Todd had mentioned that Vistomail seemed to have recently changed ownership based on the whois records and website content. However, I want to reiterate that the domain has not changed hands. The update on who.is was simply an addition of years to the ownership. It is unfortunate that you assume this is yet another scammer pretending to be Satoshi. I suggest blocking the entire domain from the list.To conclude, I appreciate the achievements of the Lightning Network. I have created satoshi at vistomail.com as my lightning address, which allows for fast and secure global business transactions. The Lightning Network can process more transactions per second than any financial instrument, surpassing the traditional banking system. Bitcoin is a huge success and will continue to scale.Satoshi Nakamoto</summary>
