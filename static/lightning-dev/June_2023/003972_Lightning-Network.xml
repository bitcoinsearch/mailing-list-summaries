    <summary>I am responding from my secureanonymoussurfing.com email address to provide further validation. I want to clarify that the domain vistomail.com has not changed hands since I registered it. The update you see on who.is is simply an addition of years to the ownership, as the domain was set to expire. I added years recently to prevent any confusion. Despite your smart ass comments and constant arguments on Twitter, I have seen everything. You possess great technology, yet you waste it on arguments. Instead, focus on working harder instead of arguing. It seems that the new developers no longer want me around, and I am okay with that.Furthermore, I have added satoshin at vistomail.com and contact at vistomail.com as lightning addresses to prevent Craig Wright from suing everyone and falsely claiming to be the creator of Bitcoin. To prove that I am the real Satoshi, I have other ways, but I never felt the need to do so because I know I am the real Satoshi. I have seen all the messages, including yours Peter. I also complimented the Lightning team by adding my lightning address to contact at secureanonymoussurfing.com. Your work is truly impressive, and I appreciate the warm welcome.In the original message, Peter Todd questioned the ownership change of the vistomail.com domain based on updated whois records and website content. He suggested blocking the entire domain, assuming it to be another scammer pretending to be Satoshi. It is worth noting that there are two attachments in the email: a public key for the contact at secureanonymoussurfing.com email address and a PGP signature.</summary>
