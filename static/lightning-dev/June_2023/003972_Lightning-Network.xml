    <summary>In an email response from the secureanonymoussurfing.com email address, Satoshi Nakamoto clarifies that the domain vistomail.com hasn't changed hands since he registered it. He added years to ownership recently because the domain was set to expire. He also added satoshin at vistomail.com and contact at vistomail.com as lightning addresses just so Craig Wright can stop trying to sue everyone and pretend he is the creator of Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto compliments the Lightning team for their great work, creating a fast and secure payment system that can process more transactions per second than any financial instrument. He adds his lightning address to contact at secureanonymoussurfing.com. Peter Todd had made false statements about the domain, but Satoshi Nakamoto saw his comments on Twitter and asked him to stop arguing and work harder. It is unclear why Todd made these false statements. Satoshi Nakamoto claims to have many other ways to prove that he is the real Satoshi but never cared because he is the real Satoshi.</summary>
