    <summary>Maxim Orlovsky, a prominent contributor to the bitcoin community and developer of various bitcoin libraries and software, recently raised concerns about the lack of clear moderation policies in the bitcoin-dev mail list. He shared his experience of his post not being published while other emails were released the next day. Orlovsky, along with his colleagues from LNP/BP Standards Association, questioned whether his post had reached Bryan Bishop, the current moderator of the mail list.The ensuing conversation over Twitter revealed that the bitcoin-dev mail list lacked explicit moderation policies and that Bishop had abused his powers by making decisions based on personal preferences. Orlovsky proposed several solutions to address these issues. Firstly, he suggested implementing a clear moderation or pre-publication peer-review policy for the bitcoin-dev mail list. Secondly, he recommended replacing Bishop with a new moderator selected from a pool of potential candidates using the criteria of "least votes against." Thirdly, Orlovsky emphasized the importance of moderators acting solely as executors of the policies, without any personal biases.Additionally, Orlovsky proposed the creation of a dedicated mail list called "bitcoin-dev-unmoderated" where all submissions would be published without any moderation. This unmoderated list would allow interested individuals to audit the main bitcoin-dev mail list for non-censorship activities. If any non-spam emails were found to have been censored, the failing moderator(s) would be removed and replaced.Lastly, Orlovsky suggested that the incentive for working as a moderator should be reputation-based, aligning with the idea that moderators should be recognized and appreciated for their unpaid work.Orlovsky sent his proposal to the bitcoin-dev mail list and CC'd the lightning-dev mail list to ensure transparency and prevent potential censorship. He also provided links to his previous works and a Twitter conversation as evidence of the issues he wanted to address.</summary>
