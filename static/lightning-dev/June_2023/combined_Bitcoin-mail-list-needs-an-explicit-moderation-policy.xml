    <summary>Dr Maxim Orlovsky, a prominent contributor to the bitcoin community and developer of multiple bitcoin libraries and software, raised concerns about the lack of clear moderation policies in the bitcoin-dev mail list. He noticed that his post referencing the publication of a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol was not published, while other emails were released. Orlovsky, along with his colleagues from LNP/BP Standards Association, questioned whether his post reached Bryan Bishop, the current moderator.The ensuing conversation over Twitter revealed that the bitcoin-dev mail list lacked explicit moderation policies applied on a non-selective basis. It was also evident that Bishop had abused his powers based on personal preferences. Orlovsky proposed several solutions to address these issues. Firstly, he suggested implementing a clear moderation or pre-publication peer-review policy for the bitcoin-dev mail list. Secondly, he recommended replacing Bishop with a new moderator selected from a list of potential candidates using the criteria of "least votes against." Thirdly, Orlovsky emphasized that the role of the moderator(s) should be purely executive, without any personal preferences.Additionally, he proposed creating a dedicated mail list called "bitcoin-dev-unmoderated" where all submissions would be published without moderation. This unmoderated list would allow people interested in non-censored discussions to participate, and any instances of censorship could be publicly announced. In such cases, failing moderators would be removed and replaced. Finally, Orlovsky suggested that the incentive to work as a moderator should be reputation-based.To support his claims, Orlovsky provided links to his previous works and endorsements from known community members. The annex A included a Twitter conversation between Orlovsky and other moderators reviewing his submission, highlighting the lack of explicit moderation policies and personal biases. Orlovsky concluded his email by restating his proposals and expressing his concerns regarding the moderation practices in the bitcoin-dev mail list.</summary>
