    <summary>Dr Maxim Orlovsky, a contributor to the bitcoin community and developer of multiple bitcoin libraries and software, raised concerns about the lack of clear moderation policies in the bitcoin-dev mail list after his post was published only after a requirement from Peter Todd. Orlovsky accused the current moderator, Bryan Bishop, of abusing his powers in achieving his agenda based on personal likes or dislikes. He proposed several solutions, including a clear moderation policy, the replacement of Bishop with a new moderator, and the creation of a dedicated mail list for unmoderated submissions. To prevent potential censorship, Orlovsky sent the list to bitcoin-dev mail list and CC'd lightning-dev mail list. In a Twitter conversation shared as annex A, other moderators reviewed Orlovsky's submission, while Bishop questioned the abuse being alleged and suggested that Orlovsky should include other tweets he sent for context.</summary>
