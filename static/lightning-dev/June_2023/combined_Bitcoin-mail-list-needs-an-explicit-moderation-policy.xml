    <summary>Maxim Orlovsky, a well-known developer of multiple bitcoin libraries and software, raised concerns about the lack of clear moderation policies in the bitcoin-dev mail list. Orlovsky's post, referencing the publication of a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol, was not published while other emails were released to bitcoin-dev, raising suspicions. Orlovsky and his colleagues from LNP/BP Standards Association started asking questions about whether this post ever got to Bryan Bishop, the current moderator of the mail list. The ensuing conversation over Twitter revealed that bitcoin-dev mail list lacked clear explicit moderation policies, which must be applied on a non-selective basis. Orlovsky accused Bishop of abusing his powers based on personal likes or dislikes and proposed several solutions. Firstly, the bitcoin-dev mail list must have a clear moderation policy. Secondly, Bishop must be replaced with a new moderator who should be selected from a list of potential candidates using the criteria “least votes against”. Thirdly, the role of the moderator(s) must be purely executive of the policies, without any personal preferences. Fourthly, a dedicated mail list should be created (“bitcoin-dev-unmoderated”) which will publish all submissions without moderation. Lastly, the incentive to work as a moderator should be reputation-based.In a response to Orlovsky's accusations, Bishop questioned the abuse being alleged and suggested that Orlovsky include other tweets he sent for context. He also clarified that not everyone believes in quantum consciousness and is interested in hearing about it. Orlovsky sent the list to bitcoin-dev mail list and CC'd lightning-dev mail list to prevent potential censorship. He also provided links to his previous works and the Twitter conversation for reference.</summary>
