    <summary>Dr Maxim Orlovsky, a contributor to the bitcoin community and developer of multiple bitcoin libraries and software, raised concerns about the lack of clear moderation policies on the bitcoin-dev mail list after his post referencing the publication of a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol was not published while other emails were released. In response, Orlovsky proposed several solutions, including a clear moderation (or pre-publication peer-review policy), replacing current moderator Bryan Bishop with a new moderator who should be selected from a list of potential candidates using the criteria “least votes against”, and creating a dedicated mail list (“bitcoin-dev-unmoderated”) which will publish all submissions without moderation. The incentive to work as a moderator should be reputation-based. Orlovsky sent the list to bitcoin-dev mail list and CC'd lightning-dev mail list to prevent potential censorship. He also provided links to his previous works and the Twitter conversation for reference. The ensuing Twitter conversation revealed that Bishop had abused his powers in achieving his agenda based on personal likes or dislikes. Bishop responded by questioning the abuse being alleged and suggested that Orlovsky should include the other tweets he sent for context. He also suspected that Orlovsky may be attributing malice to him because he asked him to stop tagging him on quantum woo. Bishop clarified that not everyone believes in quantum consciousness and is interested in hearing about it. The conversation showcased the problem Orlovsky aimed to address in his proposal: the bitcoin-dev mail list lacked clear explicit moderation policies, which must be applied on a non-selective basis.</summary>
