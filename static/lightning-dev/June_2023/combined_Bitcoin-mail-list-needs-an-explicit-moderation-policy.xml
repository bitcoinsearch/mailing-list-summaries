    <summary>In response, Orlovsky emphasized that he was not expecting Bishop to help him, but rather openly declare a moderation (or peer review) policy and follow it. He argued that the bitcoin-dev mail list lacked an explicit moderation policy and that personal preferences should not influence the moderator's role. Orlovsky proposed several solutions, including the implementation of a clear moderation policy, replacing Bishop with a new moderator selected from potential candidates, creating a dedicated unmoderated mail list for non-censorship purposes, and making the role of a moderator reputation-based. Orlovsky concluded his post by restating his case and expressing his hope for positive changes. The context also includes links to Orlovsky's previous works and the Twitter conversation for reference.</summary>
