    <summary>Dr Maxim Orlovsky, a contributor to the bitcoin community and developer of multiple bitcoin libraries and software, raised concerns about the lack of clear moderation policies in the bitcoin-dev mail list after his post was not published. Despite receiving support from known community members, other emails were released to bitcoin-dev while his remained unpublished. Orlovsky and his colleagues from LNP/BP Standards Association started asking questions about whether this post ever got to Bryan Bishop, the current moderator of the mail list. The ensuing conversation over Twitter revealed that Bishop had abused his powers based on personal likes or dislikes. In response, Orlovsky proposed several solutions, including replacing Bishop with a new moderator and creating a dedicated mail list for unmoderated submissions. Orlovsky sent the list to bitcoin-dev mail list and CC'd lightning-dev mail list to prevent potential censorship. He also provided links to his previous works and the Twitter conversation for reference.</summary>
