    <summary>Maxim Orlovsky, a well-known contributor to the bitcoin community and developer of various bitcoin libraries and software, recently sent a post to the bitcoin-dev mail list regarding the publication of a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol. Despite receiving support from community members and having a reputable background, his post was not published while other emails were released to the list. This raised concerns, leading Orlovsky and his colleagues to question whether his post had reached Bryan Bishop, the current moderator.Through a conversation on Twitter, it became evident that the bitcoin-dev mail list lacked clear explicit moderation policies that should be applied uniformly. Additionally, Bishop was accused of abusing his powers by prioritizing personal preferences over objective criteria. To address these issues, Orlovsky proposed several solutions. Firstly, he suggested implementing a clear moderation or pre-publication peer-review policy for the bitcoin-dev mail list. Secondly, he recommended replacing Bishop with a new moderator chosen from potential candidates based on the "least votes against" criterion. Thirdly, he emphasized that the role of the moderator(s) should be strictly executive, without personal biases.Furthermore, Orlovsky proposed creating a dedicated mail list called "bitcoin-dev-unmoderated," which would publish all submissions without any moderation. Although this unmoderated list might contain spam, it would allow interested parties to audit the bitcoin-dev main mail list for censorship. If any non-spam emails were found to be censored, the failing moderator(s) would be removed and replaced. Lastly, Orlovsky suggested that the incentive to work as a moderator should be reputation-based.Orlovsky sent his proposal to the bitcoin-dev mail list and also CC'd the lightning-dev mail list to ensure transparency and prevent potential censorship. He provided links to his previous works and the Twitter conversation as evidence supporting his concerns. The annex A in his email contained a Twitter conversation between Orlovsky and other moderators discussing the review and publication process, highlighting the lack of clear moderation policies.In response to Orlovsky's concerns, Bishop questioned the allegations of abuse and suggested that Orlovsky include the other tweets he sent for context. He also mentioned that his request to stop tagging him on quantum woo may have led Orlovsky to attribute malice to him. Bishop clarified that not everyone believes in quantum consciousness and may not be interested in hearing about it.Overall, Orlovsky's case raises important points about the need for clear moderation policies and unbiased moderation practices within the bitcoin-dev mail list.</summary>
