    <summary>Dr. Maxim Orlovsky, a contributor to the bitcoin community and developer of multiple bitcoin libraries and software, raised concerns about the lack of clear moderation policies in the bitcoin-dev mail list. He highlighted an incident where his post referencing a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol was not published despite receiving support from known community members. Orlovsky suspected that the current moderator, Bryan Bishop, had abused his powers based on personal likes or dislikes. The ensuing conversation over Twitter revealed the need for explicit moderation policies and non-selective application. Orlovsky proposed several solutions, including the establishment of a clear moderation or pre-publication peer-review policy, replacing Bishop with a new moderator selected through criteria of "least votes against," ensuring that moderators solely execute policies without personal preferences, creating a dedicated unmoderated mail list ("bitcoin-dev-unmoderated") for publishing all submissions, and basing the incentive to work as a moderator on reputation. Orlovsky sent the proposal to the bitcoin-dev mail list and CC'd the lightning-dev mail list to prevent potential censorship. Relevant links to his previous works and the Twitter conversation were provided for reference.Overall, the context highlights the issues faced with the moderation of the bitcoin-dev mail list and proposes solutions to ensure fair and unbiased treatment of submissions.</summary>
