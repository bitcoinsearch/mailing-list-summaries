    <summary>Dr. Maxim Orlovsky, a contributor to the bitcoin community and developer of multiple bitcoin libraries and software, raised concerns about the lack of clear moderation policies in the bitcoin-dev mail list. He accused the current moderator, Bryan Bishop, of abusing his powers based on personal likes or dislikes. Orlovsky's post referencing the publication of a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol did not get published the next day, while other emails were released. Orlovsky and his colleagues questioned whether Bishop received the post. The ensuing conversation over Twitter revealed the need for clear moderation policies applied non-selectively. Orlovsky proposed solutions: implementing a clear moderation policy, replacing Bishop with a new moderator selected from potential candidates, ensuring moderators follow policies without personal preferences, creating a dedicated unmoderated mail list, and making the incentive to work as a moderator reputation-based. Orlovsky sent the proposals to the bitcoin-dev mail list and CC'd the lightning-dev mail list. He provided links to his previous works and the Twitter conversation for reference.</summary>
