    <summary>Maxim Orlovsky, a prominent contributor to the bitcoin community, recently raised concerns about the lack of clear moderation policies on the bitcoin-dev mail list. Orlovsky had sent a post referencing a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol, which received support from known community members but was not published the next day. This led Orlovsky and his colleagues to question whether the post had reached Bryan Bishop, the current moderator.The ensuing conversation on Twitter revealed that the bitcoin-dev mail list lacked explicit moderation policies and that Bishop had abused his powers by promoting personal likes or dislikes. In response, Orlovsky proposed several solutions. Firstly, he suggested implementing clear moderation or pre-publication peer-review policies on the mail list. Secondly, he recommended replacing Bishop with a new moderator selected from a list of potential candidates using the criteria of "least votes against." Additionally, Orlovsky emphasized the need for moderators to be purely executive in their role, without personal preferences.Furthermore, Orlovsky proposed the creation of a dedicated mail list called "bitcoin-dev-unmoderated," which would publish all submissions without moderation. This list would serve as an auditing mechanism for the main mail list, allowing readers to identify any instances of censorship. If non-spam emails were found to have been censored, failing moderators would be removed and replaced. Lastly, Orlovsky suggested that the incentive to work as a moderator should be reputation-based.Orlovsky sent his proposal to the bitcoin-dev mail list and also CC'd the lightning-dev mail list to prevent potential censorship. He provided links to his previous works, including RGB smart contracts and the rust lightning implementation named LNP, as well as multiple bitcoin libraries and software. Additionally, he included tweets from the conversation on Twitter as annex A for reference.</summary>
