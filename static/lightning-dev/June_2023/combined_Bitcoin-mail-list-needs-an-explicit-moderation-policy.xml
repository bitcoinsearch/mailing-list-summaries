    <summary>Maxim Orlovsky, a contributor to the bitcoin community and developer of multiple bitcoin libraries and software, sent a post to bitcoin-dev mail list referencing the publication of a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol. Despite receiving support from known community members, the post was not published the next day, while other emails were released to bitcoin-dev. Orlovsky and his colleagues from LNP/BP Standards Association started asking questions about whether this post ever got to Bryan Bishop, the current moderator of the mail list. The ensuing conversation over Twitter revealed that bitcoin-dev mail list lacked clear explicit moderation policies, which must be applied on a non-selective basis. Also, Bishop had abused his powers in achieving his agenda based on personal likes or dislikes.In response, Orlovsky proposed several solutions. Firstly, the bitcoin-dev mail list must have a clear moderation (or pre-publication peer-review policy). Secondly, Bishop must be replaced with a new moderator who should be selected from a list of potential candidates using the criteria “least votes against”. Thirdly, the role of the moderator(s) must be purely executive of the policies, without any personal preferences. Fourthly, a dedicated mail list should be created (“bitcoin-dev-unmoderated”) which will publish all submissions without moderation. Lastly, the incentive to work as a moderator should be reputation-based. Orlovsky sent the list to bitcoin-dev mail list and CC'd lightning-dev mail list to prevent potential censorship. He also provided links to his previous works and the Twitter conversation for reference.In a mailing list for developers, Dr Maxim Orlovsky raised concerns about the lack of clear moderation policies after his post was published only after a requirement from Peter Todd. He also accused the current moderator, Bryan Bishop, of abusing his powers in achieving his agenda based on personal likes or dislikes. Orlovsky's tweets regarding his submission to the bitcoin-dev mail list were shared as annex A, which included comments from other moderators reviewing it. Bishop responded by questioning the abuse being alleged and suggested that Orlovsky should include the other tweets he sent for context. He also suspected that Orlovsky may be attributing malice to him because he asked him to stop tagging him on quantum woo. Bishop clarified that not everyone believes in quantum consciousness and is interested in hearing about it.</summary>
