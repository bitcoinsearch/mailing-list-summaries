    <summary>Dr. Maxim Orlovsky raised concerns about the lack of clear moderation policies in the bitcoin-dev mail list after his post was published only after a requirement from Peter Todd. He accused the current moderator, Bryan Bishop, of abusing his powers based on personal preferences. Orlovsky proposed that the mail list should have a clear moderation or pre-publication peer-review policy and that Bishop should be replaced with a new moderator selected through a voting process. He also suggested creating a dedicated mail list for unmoderated submissions and making the role of the moderator purely executive without personal preferences. Orlovsky's post referenced the publication of a new Bitcoin scalability and privacy protocol and received support from known community members. However, it was not published the next day while other emails were released to bitcoin-dev. Orlovsky and his colleagues questioned whether Bishop had received the post. The ensuing conversation on Twitter revealed the lack of clear moderation policies and Bishop's alleged abuse of power. Orlovsky provided links to his previous works and the Twitter conversation for reference.</summary>
