    <title>Proposal: Bundled payments</title>

    <summary>The email thread in question is from the Lightning-dev mailing list, which is a forum for developers working on the Lightning Network, a protocol that enables fast and cheap Bitcoin transactions. The email contains no specific technical content related to the Lightning Network. Instead, it is a proposal from Thomas Voegtlin to extend BOLT-11 by adding two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts.The purpose of this proposal is to enable services that require the prepayment of a mining fee in order for a non-custodian exchange to take place. The proposal aims to level the field in terms of competition between lightning service providers. Currently, you need to use a dedicated client in order to use Loop, and competitors who do not have an established user base running a dedicated client are exposed to the mining fee attack.The proposal does not require the exchange of new messages, making things unnecessarily complicated. However, two major implementations have an incentive to support this proposal. Lightning Labs could potentially offer their Loop service to non-LND users, while ACINQ would be able to open channels to Phoenix users without requesting the preimage first. Additionally, Electrum can support the feature.The email footer includes legal details about Electrum Technologies GmbH, such as their registered address, registration court, and company registration number (HRB 164636). The company is based in Berlin, Germany, and run by Thomas Voegtlin, who is also named as the Geschäftsführer (German for managing director) of the company.Overall, this email provides contact and legal information for Electrum Technologies GmbH and is sent in the context of the Lightning-dev mailing list.</summary>
