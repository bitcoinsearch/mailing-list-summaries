    <summary>In an email exchange between Thomas and Bastien, Thomas proposes an extension to BOLT-11 where invoices can contain two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts. This would be beneficial for services that require prepayment of a mining fee for a non-custodian exchange, like submarine swaps and JIT channels. Thomas points out the limitations and potential vulnerabilities of current implementations of JIT liquidity strategies, suggesting that pre-payment of the fee can be combined with 0-conf.Bastien responds by emphasizing the need for senders to be aware of the channel creation or splice on the receiver end in Thomas' proposal. He suggests that extending BOLT-12 makes more sense than updating BOLT-11, as it requires new sender code anyway. Bastien also discusses the strategies currently deployed for JIT liquidity and explains why they were chosen. He agrees that pre-paying fees would make more sense if 0-conf is not being used anymore.Thomas replies to Bastien, stating that his proposal is a small change that only requires a new invoice feature. He suggests making this feature optional during a transition period and outlines how it could work. Thomas believes that the decision to make this feature required or optional should be left to the service provider. He argues that the proposed change would benefit Lightning service providers by leveling the competition field.In conclusion, Thomas believes that the proposed extension to BOLT-11 can solve issues related to prepayment of mining fees in non-custodian exchanges. He argues that this change should be implemented in BOLT-11 rather than using BOLT-12 or onion messages. The email exchange between Thomas and Bastien provides insights into the technical aspects and implications of the proposal.Electrum Technologies GmbH, a company based in Berlin, Germany, provides its contact information at the end of an email thread on the Lightning-dev mailing list. The email thread includes a link to the mailing list's subscription page, which is hosted on the Linux Foundation's website. The company is registered with the Amtsgericht Charlottenburg in Berlin, with Thomas Voegtlin listed as the Geschäftsführer (Managing Director) of Electrum Technologies GmbH.</summary>
