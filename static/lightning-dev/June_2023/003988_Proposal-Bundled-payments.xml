    <summary>Thomas Voegtlin, the CEO of Electrum Technologies GmbH, proposed an extension to BOLT-11 that would allow for two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts. The use case for this proposal is for services that require prepayment of a mining fee in order for a non-custodian exchange to take place. Thomas believes that this change should be implemented in BOLT-11 rather than using BOLT-12 or onion messages. He also proposes making bundled payments optional during a transition period and believes that this proposal would level the field in terms of competition between lightning service providers.Bastien Teinturier suggested that extending BOLT-12 makes more sense than updating BOLT-11. He sees only three strategies to provide JIT (just-in-time) liquidity: ask the receiver for the preimage and a fee, then open a channel and push the HTLC (hash time-locked contract) amount minus the fee; open a channel, then forward the HTLC amount minus a fee; or pre-pay the fee, then open a channel and forward the whole HTLC amount on that channel. Both Thomas and Bastien agree that the proposed change could be deployed much faster if adopted in BOLT-11. Thomas believes that pre-payment of the mining fee can be combined with 0-conf. He also thinks it will take years after it is merged until BOLT-12 actually becomes the dominant payment method on Lightning. Thomas proposes the goal of his proposal is to level the field of competition between Lightning service providers, by allowing reverse submarine swap payments to come from any wallet, and by allowing JIT channels to be provided by companies who do not distribute a dedicated wallet that trusts them.Thomas mentions that two major implementations have an incentive to support his proposal: Lightning Labs could potentially offer their Loop service to non-LND users, and ACINQ would be able to open channels to Phoenix users without requesting the preimage first. This would put them on the safe side of the upcoming MICA regulation.The email signature also includes the contact information for Electrum Technologies GmbH, a company based in Berlin, Germany. The company is involved in the development of the lightning network, a layer-two scaling solution for Bitcoin. The lightning network aims to reduce settlement times and fees on the Bitcoin network. Additionally, the email mentions the Lightning-dev mailing list hosted by lists.linuxfoundation.org. The mailing list is open for developers to discuss the lightning network.</summary>
