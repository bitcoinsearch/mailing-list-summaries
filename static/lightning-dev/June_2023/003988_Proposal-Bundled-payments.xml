    <summary>In an email exchange between Thomas Voegtlin and Bastien Teinturier, Voegtlin proposed an extension to BOLT-11. This extension would allow an invoice to contain two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts. The proposal is aimed at services that require the prepayment of a mining fee in order for a non-custodian exchange to take place. The proposal was informed by the fact that some competitors who require a dedicated wallet cannot ask for a prepayment. This creates a situation where such companies are vulnerable to DoS attacks, where the attacker forces them to pay on-chain fees. In addition, some providers who want to protect themselves against this mining fee attack need to ask the preimage of the main payment before they open the channel. Therefore, the proposal would level the field in terms of competition between lightning service providers.Currently, you need to use a dedicated client in order to use Loop, and competitors who do not have an established user base running a dedicated client are exposed to the mining fee attack. The context provided is an email signature from Electrum Technologies GmbH, a company located in Berlin, Germany. The email includes information such as the company's address, commercial register number, and managing director. Additionally, the email includes a link to the Lightning-dev mailing list, which is hosted by the Linux Foundation. This mailing list is used for discussions related to the development of Lightning Network, a technology that allows for faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions.</summary>
