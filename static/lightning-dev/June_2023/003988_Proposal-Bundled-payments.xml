    <summary>In an email exchange, Thomas Voegtlin proposes an extension to BOLT-11 that would allow invoices to contain two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts. This change would benefit services that require a prepayment of a mining fee for non-custodian exchanges, such as submarine swaps and JIT channels. Currently, some services can ask for a prepayment because their software can handle it, while others cannot, creating vulnerabilities and disadvantages for certain Lightning service providers. Voegtlin suggests that by bundling the prepayment and main payment in the same BOLT-11 invoice, the field of competition between Lightning service providers could be leveled. He believes this change should be implemented in BOLT-11 rather than using BOLT-12 or onion messages, as it does not require the exchange of new messages and can be done in a non-interactive way.In response to Voegtlin's proposal, Bastien Teinturier highlights the importance of senders being aware that the payment will lead to a channel creation or splice on the receiver's end. He discusses three strategies for providing just-in-time (JIT) liquidity and mentions that currently deployed strategies do not require senders to be aware of JIT liquidity. Teinturier also mentions the use of 0-conf and its potential future deployment in Bolt 12. He suggests that Voegtlin's proposal could be included in Bolt 12 rather than Bolt 11, considering that all implementations are actively working on Bolt 12.Matt Corallo expresses skepticism about the feasibility of introducing a new interoperable change in Bolt 11 at this point and suggests that the need for the proposed feature may be obviated by splice-out. He also questions why the feature shouldn't be built on OMs for more privacy.In conclusion, Voegtlin emphasizes the minimalistic nature of his proposed change and suggests a transition period during which the new feature could be made optional. He believes that this change would benefit certain Lightning service providers and level the competition field. Voegtlin also maintains that the change should be implemented in Bolt 11 rather than using other protocols.Electrum Technologies GmbH, a company based in Berlin, Germany, has provided their contact information on the lightning-dev mailing list.
