    <summary>In an email exchange, Thomas Voegtlin proposed an extension to BOLT-11, the Lightning Network protocol. The extension would allow invoices to contain two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts. This change aims to address the need for services that require a prepayment of a mining fee for non-custodian exchanges like submarine swaps and JIT channels. Thomas believes that adding this feature would benefit Lightning Labs and ACINQ, as well as protect service providers against mining fee attacks and make pay-to-open services fully non-custodian.Matt Corallo expressed skepticism about adding new interoperable changes to BOLT-11. He highlighted the difficulty of getting amount-less BOLT-11 invoices widely supported and suggested that if there is a need for a standard way of doing swaps, it should be built on OMs (Output Messages) for privacy and compatibility with splice-out. Bastien TEINTURIER also weighed in, emphasizing the importance of considering the impact on senders and updating existing software. He proposed extending BOLT-12, which already requires new sender code.Thomas responded by stating that any new feature added to the Lightning protocol should be minimalistic and not require more interactivity than what BOLT-11 already offers. He provided a specific implementation for the new invoice feature, making it optional during a transition period and offering a workaround for submarine swap providers to mitigate potential mining fee griefing attacks.In conclusion, Thomas's proposal aims to address the challenges faced by services that require prepayments for non-custodian exchanges. The discussion involves considerations of technical needs, compatibility, trust, and regulation within the Lightning Network ecosystem.In a mailing list post, ThomasV proposed a non-interactive approach to address the use case of BOLT-11 without introducing new messages. This proposal was made in the context of the Lightning-dev mailing list, which focuses on Lightning Network development. The post was made by Electrum Technologies GmbH, a company based in Berlin, Germany. The Lightning-dev mailing list is maintained by the Linux Foundation and serves as a platform for discussing Lightning Network development. ThomasV's proposal aims to simplify the process of addressing the use case of BOLT-11 by avoiding the introduction of new messages and opting for a non-interactive approach instead.</summary>
