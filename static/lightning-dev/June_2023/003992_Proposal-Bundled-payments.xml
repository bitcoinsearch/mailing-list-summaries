    <summary>In an email thread, Thomas Voegtlin discusses the implementation of BOLT-12 in Electrum and its potential impact on bundled payments. He suggests that if the feature was adopted in BOLT-11 instead, it could be deployed faster. However, he acknowledges that any upgrade requiring wallets to change takes years to be widely adopted.Bastien TEINTURIER responds to Thomas, highlighting the importance of updating sender software for the proposed channel creation or splice on the receiver end. He proposes three strategies for providing JIT liquidity and explains that currently, strategies 1 and 2 are implemented in the network. He suggests that option 2, which involves opening a channel and forwarding the HTLC amount minus a fee, works well with trust and regulation considerations. He also mentions the possibility of pre-paying fees if zero-confirmation (0-conf) is no longer used, but recommends including the new feature in BOLT-12 rather than BOLT-11 due to ongoing implementations.Thomas responds, emphasizing that the proposed change to the Lightning protocol is minimal and suggests adding a new invoice feature that describes the prepayment of a fee using a different preimage. He outlines how this feature could be made optional during a transition period and mentions potential benefits for Lightning Labs and ACINQ. He also encourages support for the feature in LDK and expresses his support from Electrum.Matt Corallo expresses skepticism about introducing new interoperable changes to BOLT-11, citing difficulties in getting amount-less BOLT-11 invoices broadly supported. He questions the need for the proposed change in relation to splice-out and suggests exploring privacy-focused options based on OMs (Opaque Messages).In a previous email, Thomas Voegtlin proposes an extension to BOLT-11 that allows invoices to contain two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts. He explains that this is useful for services that require the prepayment of a mining fee, such as submarine swaps and JIT channels. He highlights the current vulnerabilities and legal implications associated with existing implementations and suggests bundling the prepayment and main payment in the same BOLT-11 invoice. He describes the semantics of bundled payments and believes this change would level the playing field between lightning service providers. He also mentions potential benefits for Lightning Labs and ACINQ in terms of non-custodian services and regulatory compliance.Overall, the discussion revolves around the implementation of BOLT-12, the challenges and advantages of bundled payments, and the potential impact on various lightning service providers.In a recent proposal on the Lightning-dev mailing list, ThomasV suggested a non-interactive approach to address the use case of BOLT-11 without introducing new messages such as BOLT-12 or onion messages. He argued that adding new messages would unnecessarily complicate the process. The proposal was made by ThomasV from Electrum Technologies GmbH, based in Berlin, Germany. The company's details include their address, registration court, and business registration number. ThomasV is listed as the Geschäftsführer or managing director.The Lightning-dev mailing list, hosted by the Linux Foundation, is a platform for discussing Lightning Network development. The link provided allows users to access the mailing list and subscribe to receive updates and participate in discussions related to Lightning Network development.Overall, ThomasV's proposal suggests an alternative approach to address the use case of BOLT-11 without introducing new messages. His argument is based on the idea that non-interactive methods can accomplish the same goal without unnecessary complications.</summary>
