    <summary>Thomas Voegtlin, founder of Electrum wallet, proposed an extension to the BOLT-11 invoice. The proposal allows for two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts. This feature is useful for services that require a prepayment of a mining fee before a non-custodian exchange can take place. In such cases, the service provider receives an HTLC for which they do not have the preimage and must send funds on-chain to the channel or submarine swap funding address. They then wait for the client to reveal the preimage when claiming payment. Lightning Labs and ACINQ are among the major implementations that have an incentive to support this proposal. Lightning Labs could offer their Loop service to non-LND users, while ACINQ could open channels to Phoenix users without requesting the preimage first. Bastien TEINTURIER suggested extending Bolt 12 instead of updating Bolt 11. He believes it requires new sender code anyway and all implementations are actively working on it. He discussed three strategies to provide just-in-time liquidity (JIT). In response to Matt Corallo's inquiry about why the need isn't obviated by splice-out and why it shouldn't be built on OMs so you can do it more privately, Bastien discussed the advantages of strategy 1 and 2. Thomas Voegtlin proposed making a tiny change to the Lightning protocol to add a new feature, which describes the prepayment of a fee using a different preimage. Voegtlin also suggested a new method for channel factories in Lightning Network. Instead of using BOLT-12 or onion messages, he suggests using BOLT-11 as it simplifies the process by eliminating the need for new message exchanges. Although his proposal received feedback that it is a good use case for BOLT-12 or onion messages, Voegtlin believes that adding new messages unnecessarily complicates things. The Lightning-dev mailing list was used to discuss this proposal. Electrum Technologies GmbH, located in Berlin, Germany, is Voegtlin's company.</summary>
