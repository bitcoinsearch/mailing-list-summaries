    <summary>Antoine Riard, a Lightning Network (LN) developer, is proposing to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. Africa is considered an ideal location due to its rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems, and a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent. The summit also presents opportunities to build local Lightning economies.While it is uncommon to announce events like CoreDev or LN Summit on open communication channels, Antoine believes it is necessary to announce the summit well in advance due to potential complexities such as visa travels and tropical weather. He emphasizes the importance of maintaining fairness and transparency by adopting a multi-stakeholder approach.Antoine invites objections or feedback regarding his involvement in organizing the LN Summit 2024, emphasizing his commitment to transparency and accountability. He sets up a survey to determine suitable countries with reasonable operational stability for hosting the summit, including Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. The feedback will be shared privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics.To facilitate communication, Antoine establishes a dedicated email address, lnsummit2024@ariard.me, for anyone interested in being part of the organization. He encourages Lightning Network developers to participate, seeing it as an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors.Antoine concludes his message by mentioning his experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, which provides him with operational templates for the upcoming LN Summit. Overall, his proposal emphasizes the potential of Africa as a host location and the importance of collaboration and inclusivity in organizing the event.</summary>
