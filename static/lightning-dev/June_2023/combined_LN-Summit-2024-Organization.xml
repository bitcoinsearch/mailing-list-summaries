    <summary>Antoine Riard has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes there are several reasons to hold the summit in Africa, including its beautiful continent, rich cultural and historical past, fragmentation in the financial systems of the 56 states that can be solved with a compatible payment protocol, explosive demography with a lot of energy to get things done, and an increasing number of Lightning developers coming from the continent.Antoine acknowledges that usually, the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit is not announced on open communication channels in order to maintain serenity in engineering conversations and avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, given the potential operational challenges such as visa travels and tropical weather, he thinks it's better to announce the summit far ahead. He also suggests adopting a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the process.Antoine invites anyone with objections to his contribution to the organization of the LN Summit 2024 to let him know in the coming weeks, either publicly, on the thread, or privately by mail. He emphasizes his commitment to strong transparency and accountability standards, emphasizing that actions speak louder than words in matters of open-source.To start small, Antoine plans to survey countries with reasonable operational stability that can fit the location of the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, and others. He will share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics towards the end of the summer.Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint for the LN Summit 2024: lnsummit2024@ariard.me. He encourages Lightning Network developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization, seeing it as an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.Overall, Antoine's proposal to organize the LN Summit in Africa in 2024 has generated interest and support, with Bernard expressing his intention to reach out and contribute.</summary>
