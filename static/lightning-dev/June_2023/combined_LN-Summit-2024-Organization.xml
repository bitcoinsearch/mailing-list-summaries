    <summary>Antoine Riard, a Lightning developer, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlights several reasons for choosing Africa as the location, including its rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems in the 56 states that can be solved with a compatible payment protocol, an energetic demography, and the increasing number of Lightning developers coming from the continent. Antoine mentions that the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit is usually not announced on open communication channels to maintain serenity in engineering conversations and avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, due to the potential complexity of operations such as visa travels and "tropical weather," he suggests announcing it far ahead. He also suggests adopting a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the process.Antoine invites feedback or objections to his contribution to the organization of LN Summit 2024, emphasizing his commitment to transparency and accountability. He plans to start small by surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that can fit the location, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, etc. The feedback will be shared privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics at the end of the summer.To facilitate communication, Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint: lnsummit2024 at ariard.me. He encourages Lightning Network developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization, as it presents an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.Bernard expresses interest in Antoine's proposal and states that he will reach out to discuss further.</summary>
