    <summary>Antoine Riard, a Lightning Network developer, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes that Africa is an ideal location for the summit due to its cultural richness, historical significance, fragmented financial systems, and the growing number of Lightning developers on the continent. Antoine acknowledges that it is unusual to announce events like CoreDev or LN Summit on open communication channels, but he believes that announcing the summit well ahead of time is necessary due to potential operational challenges such as visa travels and tropical weather.Antoine suggests adopting a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the organization of the summit. He welcomes objections or feedback regarding his contribution and emphasizes his commitment to strong transparency and accountability standards. Antoine believes that actions speak louder than words in the open-source community.To begin the project, Antoine plans to survey countries with reasonable operational stability, including Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria, to determine the best location for the summit. The results of the survey will be shared privately with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer.Antoine has established a dedicated communication endpoint for the LN Summit 2024 and invites LN developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization. He sees this as an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors. Antoine also mentions his previous experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, which provides him with operational templates for the LN Summit.Overall, Antoine's proposal to hold the LN Summit in Africa highlights the continent's potential and the need for collaboration and inclusivity in organizing the event.</summary>
