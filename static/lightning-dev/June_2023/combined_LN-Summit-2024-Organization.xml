    <summary>Antoine Riard is proposing to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes that Africa has many reasons to host the summit, including its beauty, rich cultural and historical past, fragmentation in financial systems that can be solved with a compatible payment protocol, an energetic population, and an increasing number of Lightning developers from the continent. In the past, the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit events were not announced on open communication channels to maintain serenity in engineering conversations and avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, given the potential operational challenges such as visa travels and tropical weather, Antoine suggests announcing the event well in advance. He also emphasizes the importance of a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency.Antoine invites any objections or feedback regarding his contribution to organizing the LN Summit 2024. He promises to uphold strong transparency and accountability standards. He plans to start small by surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that could potentially host the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. The feedback will be shared privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics.Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint for the LN Summit 2024 at lnsummit2024@ariard.me. He encourages Lightning developers to reach out and be part of the organization, viewing it as an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors. Antoine concludes by mentioning his previous experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, which provides him with operational templates for future events.</summary>
