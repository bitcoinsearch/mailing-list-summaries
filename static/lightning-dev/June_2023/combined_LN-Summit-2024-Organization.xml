    <summary>Antoine Riard is proposing to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. There are several reasons for choosing Africa as the location, including its beauty, rich cultural and historical past, fragmentation in the financial systems of the 56 states that can be solved with a compatible payment protocol, an energetic demography, and the increasing number of Lightning developers from the continent. Usually, the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit is not announced on open channels to maintain serenity in the engineering conversation and avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, this time, due to operational challenges such as visa travels and tropical weather, it is better to announce it ahead of time. The organizers are open to a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency.Antoine welcomes any objections or feedback regarding his contribution to the organization of the LN Summit 2024. He emphasizes the importance of strong transparency and accountability standards, stating that actions speak louder than words in the open-source community.The first step in organizing the summit is to survey countries with reasonable operational stability that could be suitable locations, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, and others. Antoine will privately share the feedback with the Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics at the end of the summer.A dedicated communication endpoint has been set up for the LN Summit 2024: lnsummit2024@ariard.me. Antoine encourages Lightning Network developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization, as it provides an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.</summary>
