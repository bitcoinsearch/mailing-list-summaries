    <summary>Antoine Riard has proposed to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes that Africa is an ideal location for the summit due to its beauty, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that can benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and the potential for local Lightning economies to thrive. Despite the usual practice of not announcing the organization of such events on open communication channels, Antoine suggests making the announcement early due to the operational challenges involved, including visa travels and tropical weather [0].While operational and financial resources are expected to be sufficient, Antoine suggests adopting a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency throughout the process. He welcomes any objections or concerns about his involvement in organizing the summit and emphasizes his commitment to maintaining strong transparency and accountability standards. He encourages individuals to express their thoughts publicly, on the thread, privately via email, or through other channels.To start the project, Antoine plans to survey countries with reasonable operational stability that can serve as potential locations for the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, and others. He intends to share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer, based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics.Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint, lnsummit2024 at ariard.me, for anyone interested in being part of the organization. He highlights that this is an excellent opportunity for knowledge transfer among generations of Lightning Network contributors. Antoine mentions that he has previously co-organized the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, which provides him with operational templates for this undertaking [0].[0] Link to previous co-organized event: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev</summary>
