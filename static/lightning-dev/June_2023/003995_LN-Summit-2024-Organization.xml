    <summary>Antoine Riard proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He highlighted several reasons for choosing Africa as the location, including its beauty, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that can be solved with a compatible payment protocol, an energetic population, and the increasing number of Lightning developers from the continent. Antoine mentioned that the organization usually does not announce such events on open communication channels, but due to the potential complexity of operations, it is better to announce it earlier. He also emphasized the importance of having a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency.Antoine requested objections or feedback regarding his contribution to the organization of the LN Summit 2024. He assured everyone of his commitment to strong transparency and accountability standards. The first step in the organization process would be to survey countries in Africa with reasonable operational stability, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, etc. Antoine planned to share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer.A dedicated communication endpoint (lnsummit2024@ariard.me) was set up for this purpose. Antoine encouraged Lightning Network developers to reach out if they wanted to be part of the organization, as it would be an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors. He also mentioned that he had previous experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021.</summary>
