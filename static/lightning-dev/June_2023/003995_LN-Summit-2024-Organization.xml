    <summary>Antoine Riard has proposed the idea of organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes that Africa is a suitable location for the summit due to its beautiful continent, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that can be solved with a compatible payment protocol, and an explosive demography with a lot of energy to get things done. Additionally, there are more Lightning developers emerging from Africa, presenting formidable perspectives to grow "full-stack" local Lightning economies.Antoine acknowledges that the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit is not usually announced on open communication channels to maintain serenity in engineering conversations and avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, given the operational challenges involved, such as visa travels and tropical weather, he believes it is better to announce the summit far ahead. While the operations and financial resources are expected to be sufficient, Antoine suggests a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency throughout the process.Antoine invites anyone with objections to his contribution to the organization of LN Summit 2024 to express them publicly or privately. He emphasizes his commitment to setting strong transparency and accountability standards, emphasizing that actions speak louder than words in open-source projects.To start small, Antoine plans to survey countries with reasonable operational stability that could serve as potential locations for the summit, including Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, among others. He will share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics at the end of the summer.Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint (lnsummit2024@ariard.me) for those interested in being part of the organization. He encourages Lightning Network developers to reach out and take advantage of this opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors. Antoine also mentions that he has previous experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich back in 2021, providing him with operational templates.Overall, Antoine's proposal for organizing the LN Summit in Africa presents a vision of leveraging the continent's potential, promoting inclusivity, and fostering the growth of local Lightning economies.</summary>
