    <summary>Antoine Riard has proposed to organize next year's LN Summit in Africa, tentatively scheduled for June 2024. He highlights several reasons why Africa would be an ideal location for the summit, including its rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that could benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and the potential for local Lightning economies to flourish.Antoine acknowledges that the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit is typically not announced on open communication channels to maintain serenity in engineering conversations and avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism. However, due to the expected operational challenges, such as visa travels and "tropical weather," Antoine believes it is better to announce the event well in advance. He also suggests adopting a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency in the process.Antoine invites feedback and objections to his involvement in organizing the LN Summit 2024. He emphasizes his commitment to maintaining strong transparency and accountability standards, emphasizing that actions speak louder than words in the open-source community.To start the project, Antoine plans to survey countries in Africa with reasonable operational stability that could serve as potential locations for the summit. He mentions Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, among others, and intends to share the feedback with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer.Antoine provides a dedicated communication endpoint (lnsummit2024 at ariard.me) for those interested in being part of the organization, particularly Lightning Network developers. He sees this as an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors.Lastly, Antoine mentions that he has previous experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, giving him a solid operational template for the LN Summit.</summary>
