    <summary>Antoine Riard has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa next year, tentatively scheduled for June 2024. He believes there are several reasons to hold the summit in Africa, including its beautiful landscape, rich cultural and historical background, fragmented financial systems that could benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and promising prospects for developing local Lightning economies. While the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit is typically not announced on open communication channels to maintain engineering conversation serenity and avoid trolling or tabloid-style journalism, Antoine believes it is important to announce this event well in advance due to potential operational challenges such as visa travels and tropical weather. While operational and financial resources should be sufficient, he suggests a multi-stakeholder approach with "skin in the game" to ensure fairness and transparency throughout the process.Antoine invites anyone with objections to his contribution to the organization of LN Summit 2024 to voice them publicly, on the thread, or privately via email. He emphasizes his commitment to strong transparency and accountability standards, valuing actions over mere talk in open-source projects. To start small, he plans to survey countries with reasonable operational stability that could serve as potential locations for the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, and others. The feedback will be shared privately with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer. Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint, lnsummit2024 at ariard.me, and encourages Lightning Network developers to reach out if they want to be part of the organization, viewing it as an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors. It's worth noting that Antoine already co-organized the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021 and has experience with operational templates.For more information, you can refer to the original thread here: [link].</summary>
