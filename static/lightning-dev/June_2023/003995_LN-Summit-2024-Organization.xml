    <summary>Antoine Riard has proposed the idea of organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. Africa is considered an ideal location for several reasons, including its beautiful landscape, rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that can benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and the potential for local Lightning economies to thrive.While the organization typically avoids announcing CoreDev or LN Summit on open communication channels to maintain a peaceful engineering conversation, it was decided to announce the event well in advance due to the anticipated operational challenges, such as visa requirements and tropical weather conditions. The availability of operational and financial resources is expected, but a multi-stakeholder approach with "skin in the game" is encouraged to ensure fairness and transparency throughout the process.Antoine invites feedback and objections regarding his involvement in organizing the LN Summit 2024. He emphasizes his commitment to maintaining strong transparency and accountability standards, emphasizing that actions speak louder than words in the open-source community.To start the process, a survey will be conducted to identify countries with reasonable operational stability that could serve as potential locations for the summit, including Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, among others. The feedback from this survey will be shared privately with Lightning attendees at the end of the summer, based on neutral and technical proof of work heuristics.A dedicated communication endpoint has been set up for the LN Summit 2024 at lnsummit2024@ariard.me. Antoine encourages Lightning Network developers to reach out if they are interested in being part of the organization, as it presents an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors.Antoine mentions that he already has operational templates from co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021.For more information, please refer to the original email thread: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev</summary>
