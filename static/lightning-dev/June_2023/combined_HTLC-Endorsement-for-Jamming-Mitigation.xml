    <summary>The Lightning Network community is actively working on mitigating channel jamming attacks through a proposed reputation scheme. The scheme involves tracking local reputation for each node's peers based on their history with HTLCs forwarded to them. Reputation is slow and expensive to build but fast to degrade, allowing for short-lived changes in behavior. Nodes will locally track the reputation of their direct neighbors and allocate slots and liquidity based on risk tolerance. Endorsed HTLCs from high reputation peers will be given priority, while unknown HTLCs will only be forwarded if there are available slots and liquidity. This reputation-based system is seen as the first step in a two-part scheme for mitigating channel jamming.There are discussions and concerns regarding the vulnerability of the HTLC endorsement scheme. The lack of transitivity of reputation acquisition cost between hops creates a potential issue where a node can sacrifice its earned reputation to inflict damage on another node's incoming link. The compensation mechanism for nodes with high reputation during an attack is unclear. Additionally, sudden changes in link throughput based on HTLC resolution may impact payment reliability and routing scoring algorithms.Data gathering efforts are underway to collect information on repeat interactions between nodes. The community plans to observe the effect of endorsement in the steady state, experiment with different algorithms for tracking local reputation, and simulate the downgrade of HTLC routing traffic. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of any jamming solution with rigorous analysis and measurable bounds.The discussion also touches on the implementation of reputation systems and the importance of privacy concerns. It is suggested that reputation systems should not be part of the protocol or P2P gossiping but rather a separate API or plugin. While reputation systems have limitations, they can still provide valuable insights for decision-making in selecting channel counterparties.The Lightning-dev mailing list serves as a platform for developers and enthusiasts to discuss and collaborate on Lightning Network development. It is hosted by the Linux Foundation and provides a space for open communication and innovation in the field. Users can join the mailing list through the provided subscription link to stay updated on discussions and developments related to Lightning technology.Overall, the Lightning Network community is actively exploring reputation-based solutions to mitigate channel jamming attacks. They are conducting data gathering and simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of different algorithms and build a more secure and reliable network.In the email thread, there is a discussion about the compensation mechanism in the HTLC endorsement model. The speaker raises questions regarding whether the fees paid fully compensate for the damage inflicted and if the ratio between fees and reputation is static or dynamic. The response suggests that the only damage observed in the protocol is routing fees, and it will be possible to choose different thresholds based on node preferences. It is also mentioned that there are suggestions for receiving nodes in terms of proportional compensation. However, specific criteria for the dynamic ratio between fees and reputation are not mentioned in the context.The conversation revolves around the topic of local-only reputation based systems. The speaker is interested in understanding the number of repeat interactions nodes get from individual senders as it helps in understanding the use of these systems. It is discussed that large routing nodes may be more vulnerable to attacks, but they are used by fewer senders, and the impact of an attack would also be proportionally smaller. However, there is confusion about what is meant by "individual senders" since nodes only track local reputation for their direct peers. It is explained that nodes track their history with all HTLCs a peer has forwarded to them, not whether they come from repeat senders.The vulnerability of the HTLC endorsement scheme is also discussed, where local reputation can be built up during low fee periods and then abused when fees are high. To address this issue, the scheme should aim for reputational transitivity between incoming and outgoing traffic. The acquisition cost of local reputation should be equal to the maximum time-value damage that one can inflict on a routing node channel accessible from its local counterparty granting this high-level of reputation. The calculation for reputation is based on a moving window where the total revenue of a node in the latest time period is used to determine the reputation from another node's point of view. It is noted that reputation gained today cannot be used in the distant future, and continuous investment is required to maintain a good reputation. The Lightning Network uses fees as a way to put a price on having a good reputation.The email thread discusses the vulnerability of the Lightning Network's endorsement scheme due to the lack of transitivity of the reputation acquisition cost between payment path hops. It is mentioned that there may be coupling effects between historical liquidity buckets and the introduction of an endorsement scheme. The effect of dynamic reputation windows on payment reliability is also observed. Nodes do not gossip about their peers' reputation, but only communicate whether an HTLC is endorsed or neutral. The email proposes a two-part scheme for mitigating channel jamming: reputation for slow jams that are easily detected as misbehavior and unconditional fees for quick jams that are difficult to detect.The post discusses the potential issues</summary>
