    <summary>In response to a previous statement made by Peter, the author of the email clarifies that the domain vistomail.com has not changed ownership since they registered it. The purchase update on who.is only reflects an extension of the ownership period to prevent expiration. Despite Peter's smart remarks and constant arguments on Twitter, the author asserts their knowledge and ability to observe everything. They criticize Peter for arguing unnecessarily and urge him to focus on working harder instead.Furthermore, the author mentions that their ability to submit posts in various Bitcoin development forums has been affected, implying that new developers may no longer want their presence. To counter Craig Wright's attempts at suing individuals and falsely claiming to be the creator of Bitcoin, the author added satoshin and contact at vistomail.com as lightning addresses. They express support for Cobra and Hodlonaut, who have stood up against Wright's claims. The author also states that they have multiple ways to prove their identity as the real Satoshi Nakamoto, but they have never felt compelled to do so because they are confident in their authenticity. They reveal that they have seen all the messages, including those from Peter, and have added their lightning address to contact at secureanonymoussurfing.com. This addition was meant to compliment the Lightning team and express gratitude for their work, making the author feel welcomed. The email concludes with the signature of Satoshi Nakamoto and attachments related to public keys.</summary>
