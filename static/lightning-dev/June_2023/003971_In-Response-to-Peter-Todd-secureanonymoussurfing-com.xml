    <summary>The author of the message responds from their secureanonymoussurfing.com email address to give more validation to their account. They address Peter and clarify that the domain vistomail.com hasn't changed hands since they registered it, and any updates on who.is are just added years of ownership. The author expresses frustration with Peter's constant arguing and dismissive comments on Twitter, and mentions that they have been stopped from submitting posts in certain groups. They also add satoshin and contact at vistomail.com as lightning addresses to prevent Craig Wright from trying to sue people and pretend he is the creator of Bitcoin. The author claims to be the real Satoshi Nakamoto and saw all the messages, including Peter's, and added their lightning address to contact at secureanonymoussurfing.com. They compliment the Lightning team for their work and thank them for making them feel welcomed. The message includes several attachments, including a public key and a digital signature.</summary>
