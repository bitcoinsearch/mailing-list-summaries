    <summary>Peter, the sender of the email, asserts that the domain vistomail.com has not changed ownership since they registered it. They explain that the updated information on who.is reflects an extension of ownership, as the domain was set to expire. Despite this clarification, Peter is accused of making false statements and engaging in arguments on Twitter. The sender claims to have observed these interactions and criticizes Peter's tendency to argue over everything. Additionally, they mention that their ability to submit posts in certain forums has been stopped, suggesting that new developers no longer want their presence. To counter Craig Wright's attempts at litigation and false claims of being the creator of Bitcoin, the sender has added "satoshin" and "contact" as lightning addresses at vistomail.com. They state that they have other ways to prove their identity as the real Satoshi but have never felt the need to do so. The sender expresses gratitude towards the Lightning team for their work and compliments them on a job well done. They conclude by thanking everyone for making them feel welcome.</summary>
