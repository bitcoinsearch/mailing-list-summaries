    <summary>Peter is accused of making false statements about the domain vistomail.com. The owner clarifies that the domain hasn't changed hands since it was registered, and the recent update on who.is only reflects an extension of ownership to prevent expiration. However, Peter's constant arguments and smart ass comments on Twitter are criticized. It is mentioned that Peter dismissed the owner's ability to submit posts in certain forums, indicating a possible attempt to start an argument. The owner adds satoshin at vistomail.com and contact at vistomail.com as lightning addresses to counter Craig Wright's attempts to sue others and claim to be the creator of Bitcoin. The owner claims to have many other ways to prove their identity as the real Satoshi but never cared to do so before. The owner acknowledges seeing all the messages, including Peter's, and expresses appreciation for the Lightning team's work and making them feel welcomed. A compliment is given to the Lightning team, and the owner's lightning address is provided for contact.</summary>
