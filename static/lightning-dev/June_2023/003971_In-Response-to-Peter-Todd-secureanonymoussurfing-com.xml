    <summary>The writer of the email, claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto, responded to someone named Peter from their secureanonymoussurfing.com email address to give more validation to their account. The writer clarified that the domain vistomail.com has not changed hands since they registered it and added years to ownership recently because it was set to expire. They also added satoshin at vistomail.com and contact at vistomail.com as lightning addresses to stop Craig Wright from suing people and pretending to be the creator of Bitcoin. The writer claimed to have many other ways to prove they are the real Satoshi but never cared to do so. They thanked the Lightning team for their work and added their lightning address to contact at secureanonymoussurfing.com.</summary>
