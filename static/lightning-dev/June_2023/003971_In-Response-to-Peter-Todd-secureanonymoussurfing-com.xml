    <summary>In response to the previous conversation, the author of the email wants to provide further validation by using their secureanonymoussurfing.com email address. They address Peter and clarify that the domain vistomail.com has not changed hands since it was registered. The update on who.is regarding the purchase of additional years of ownership was made because the domain was set to expire. Despite Peter's smart comments and constant arguments on Twitter, the author adds that they have observed everything. They mention that Peter dismisses their statements and tries to start an argument, which recently led to their ability to submit posts being stopped in various developer groups related to Bitcoin. The author understands that the new developers no longer want them around and is fine with that. They also mention that they have added satoshin at vistomail.com and contact at vistomail.com as lightning addresses to counter Craig Wright's attempts to sue everyone and claim to be the creator of Bitcoin. The author asserts that they have many other ways to prove that they are the real Satoshi but never cared to do so because they believe they are the genuine Satoshi Nakamoto. They inform Peter that they have seen all the messages, including his, and have added their lightning address to contact at secureanonymoussurfing.com. They conclude by complimenting the Lightning team for their work and expressing gratitude for feeling welcomed.</summary>
