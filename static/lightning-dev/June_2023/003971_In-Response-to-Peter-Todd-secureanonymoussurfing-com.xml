    <summary>The author of the email is responding to Peter's false statements about the domain, vistomail.com. The author clarifies that they added years of ownership to the domain and no one else has taken over the domain since it was registered. The author also added satoshin and contact at vistomail.com as lightning addresses to prevent Craig Wright from suing everyone and pretending he is the creator of Bitcoin. The author claims to have many other ways to prove that they are the real Satoshi but never cared because they are the real Satoshi. They also thanked the Lightning team for making them feel welcomed and complimented their work. The author added their lightning address to contact at secureanonymoussurfing.com.</summary>
