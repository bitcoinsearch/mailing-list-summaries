    <summary>I would like to clarify that the domain vistomail.com, which I registered, has not changed hands. The recent update on who.is showing a purchase update with added years of ownership was done by me to prevent the domain from expiring. Despite your smart comments and constant arguments on Twitter, I want you to know that I see everything. You have the latest technology at your disposal, yet you still engage in unnecessary arguments. Instead of arguing, I suggest you focus on working harder. It seems that the new developers no longer want me around, and I am completely fine with that. To further clarify, I have also added satoshin at vistomail.com and contact at vistomail.com as lightning addresses to prevent Craig Wright from suing everyone and claiming to be the creator of Bitcoin. I have various other ways to prove my identity as the real Satoshi, but I have never felt the need to do so because I am indeed the real Satoshi. I have seen all the messages, including yours, Peter. Additionally, I have added my lightning address to contact at secureanonymoussurfing.com as a way of complimenting the Lightning team for their exceptional work. Thank you all for making me feel welcomed. Satoshi Nakamoto.</summary>
