    <summary>The writer of this message responds from their secureanonymoussurfing.com email address to provide more validation to their account. They clarify that the domain vistomail.com has not changed hands since they registered it and that the purchase update on who.is only added years to ownership because the domain was set to expire. The writer mentions that they added satoshin at vistomail.com and contact at vistomail.com as lightning addresses to prevent Craig Wright from suing individuals and pretending to be the creator of Bitcoin. They also claim to have many other ways to prove that they are the real Satoshi Nakamoto but never cared because they know they are the real one. Lastly, the writer compliments the Lightning team for their great work and thanks them for making them feel welcomed.</summary>
