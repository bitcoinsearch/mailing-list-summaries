    <summary>The email is from someone claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin. The writer is responding from a secureanonymoussurfing.com email address and clarifies that the domain vistomail.com has not changed hands since they registered it. They added years to ownership recently because the domain was set to expire. The writer accuses Peter of making false statements about the domain and argues that he always starts arguments on Twitter. The writer claims to have many ways to prove that they are the real Satoshi but never cared because they know they are the real Satoshi. The writer adds their lightning address to contact at secureanonymoussurfing.com and gives a compliment to the Lightning team for their work. Finally, the writer signs off as Satoshi Nakamoto.</summary>
