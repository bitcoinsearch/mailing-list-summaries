    <summary>In a recent discussion between Antoine and Bastien, they addressed the issue of liquidity griefing in lightning network transactions. They acknowledged that traditional mempool pinning issues still apply regardless of whether 0-conf (zero-confirmation) is used or not. They agreed that these issues need to be resolved. Bastien proposed a mid-term solution of using v3 transactions for channel funding and splicing. However, he noted that this would make them identifiable on-chain, unless everyone eventually moves to v3 transactions for all transactions. They also discussed the concept of a "soft lock" strategy for selecting utxos in non 0-conf funding attempts. This strategy would allow non 0-conf funding attempts to reuse soft locked utxos while ignoring them in 0-conf funding attempts. Bastien mentioned that nodes can choose to disable inbound payments or require a longer `cltv_expiry_delta` in case of mempool fee spikes causing delays in 0-conf chain confirmation. He stated that this can be implemented as a policy decision by individual nodes without requiring any protocol changes.Antoine raised concerns about the potential for liquidity griefing in dual-funding or splicing scenarios, where a malicious counterparty can manipulate the transaction to pin it in the mempool. He suggested that the counterparty could add unrelated dual-funding transactions to batch their pinning and exploit the replacement rule. Antoine also proposed a long-term solution to mitigate liquidity griefing by adopting solutions used to mitigate channel jamming. He suggested deploying the Staking Credentials framework, which would involve the dual-funding initiator paying a fee to the market-maker based on the amount of UTXOs contributed and potential worst-case liquidity griefing scenarios. Privacy-preserving credentials could be used to maintain anonymity for dual-funding initiators within a reasonable anonymity set.In conclusion, both Bastien and Antoine recognized the challenges posed by liquidity griefing in lightning network transactions. They discussed possible solutions, including the use of v3 transactions, implementing a "soft lock" strategy, and exploring long-term solutions such as the Staking Credentials framework.</summary>
