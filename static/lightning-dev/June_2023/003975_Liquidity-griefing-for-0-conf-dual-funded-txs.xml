    <summary>In a Lightning-dev mailing list, Bastien Teinturier raised concerns regarding liquidity griefing attacks that can occur while using dual funded transactions in Lightning Network. He proposed a solution where utxos used in dual-funded transactions are never locked, and if a remote node goes silent during the protocol, the utxos will automatically be reused in another instance of the protocol. However, this approach falls short when using 0-conf as double-spending a 0-conf channel due to concurrent instances can result in the loss of funds for one of the peers. To avoid this issue, nodes offering 0-conf services have to lock utxos, which exposes them to liquidity griefing. Nodes must also ensure that the utxos they use for 0-conf are isolated from the utxos they use for non-0-conf to avoid double-spending. A mid-term solution suggested by Bastien is to use v3 transactions for channel funding and splicing, with the caveat that it makes them identifiable on-chain. In the longer term, some anti-DoS token will be needed to avoid such issues. The strategy of disabling inbound payments or requiring a longer `cltv_expiry_delta` than usual in case of mempool fee spikes delaying the 0-conf chain confirmation can be applied by nodes as a policy. Antoine Riard, in response, suggested using Staking Credentials framework, which could be deployed by dual-funding market-makers beyond routing hops. The dual-funding initiator should pay a fee scale-up on the amount of UTXOs contributed and some worst-case liquidity griefing scenario.</summary>
