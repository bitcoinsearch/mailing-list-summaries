    <summary>Proposal for an Extension to BOLT-11: Bundled PaymentsThomasV suggests an extension to BOLT-11, the Lightning Network invoice protocol. The proposed extension would allow invoices to contain two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts. This extension is particularly useful for services that require prepayment of a mining fee before a non-custodian exchange can take place, such as submarine swaps and JIT channels.In both cases, the service provider receives a Hash Time-Locked Contract (HTLC) for which they do not have the preimage. They must then send funds on-chain and wait for the client to reveal the preimage when claiming the payment. Since there is no guarantee that the client will actually claim the payment, service providers often require prepayment of mining fees.Currently, some services like Loop by Lightning Labs can ask for prepayment because their software can handle it. However, competitors like Boltz exchange cannot easily implement this feature. Not being able to request prepayment leaves these services vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, where attackers force them to pay on-chain fees.Similarly, in the case of JIT channels, providers who want to protect themselves against mining fee attacks need to ask for the preimage of the main payment before opening the channel. However, this makes them custodians of the funds, which may have legal implications under European regulations.To address these issues, ThomasV proposes bundling the prepayment and the main payment in the same BOLT-11 invoice. The semantics of bundled payments would involve including two preimages and two amounts in the invoice. The receiver would wait until all HTLCs of both payments have arrived before fulfilling the HTLCs of the prepayment. If the main payment does not arrive, the prepayment should fail with a Multi-Path Payment (MPP) timeout. Once both payments' HTLCs have arrived, the receiver can fulfill the HTLCs of the prepayment and broadcast their on-chain transaction. However, the main payment can still fail if the sender never reveals the preimage.ThomasV acknowledges that this proposal does not prevent service providers from stealing the prepayment, but argues that it would level the playing field among lightning service providers. Currently, Loop requires a dedicated client, leaving competitors without an established user base vulnerable to mining fee attacks. The proposed extension would also benefit ACINQ by enabling their pay-to-open service to become fully non-custodian, potentially addressing compliance concerns under the European MICA regulation.In conclusion, ThomasV suggests implementing this change in BOLT-11 rather than introducing new protocols like BOLT-12 or onion messages. He argues that the proposed extension can be achieved in a non-interactive way without adding new messages, simplifying the implementation process.</summary>
