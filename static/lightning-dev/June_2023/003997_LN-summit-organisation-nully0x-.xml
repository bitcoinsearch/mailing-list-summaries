    <summary>The Lightning-dev mailing list received a proposal from Antoine Riard suggesting the organization of the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. Antoine highlighted various reasons why Africa would be an ideal location for the summit, including its rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that could benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers in Africa, and the potential for local Lightning economies to thrive. Antoine acknowledged that usually, the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit is not announced on open communication channels to maintain serenity and avoid trolling. However, due to the operational challenges involved in organizing the summit in Africa, Antoine believed it was best to announce it earlier. He mentioned that operations and financial resources should be sufficient, but encouraged a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency.To begin the planning process, Antoine suggested surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that could serve as potential locations for the summit. Some of the countries he listed included Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, among others. Antoine planned to gather feedback privately from Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics.Antoine also provided a dedicated communication endpoint (lnsummit2024@ariard.me) for those interested in being part of the organization or transferring knowledge between generations of contributors.In response to Antoine's proposal, nully0x expressed support and suggested connecting with existing Bitcoin and lightning network communities in Africa, such as Qala Africa and BitDevs, to bootstrap the planning process.Overall, the proposal generated positive feedback and indicated the intention to explore opportunities and challenges related to hosting the LN Summit in Africa in 2024.</summary>
