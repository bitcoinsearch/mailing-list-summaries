    <summary>The Lightning-dev community is considering organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. Antoine Riard proposed this idea, highlighting the benefits of holding the summit in Africa, such as the cultural and historical richness of the continent, the potential to solve financial system fragmentation with a compatible payment protocol, the growing number of Lightning developers from Africa, and the opportunity to develop local Lightning economies. To ensure operational success, Antoine suggested surveying countries with reasonable stability and exploring the feasibility of hosting the event there. He also emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability in the organization process. Additionally, he mentioned previous experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021. Antoine suggested connecting with existing Bitcoin communities in Africa, such as Qala Africa and BitDevs, to facilitate the planning process. He proposed reaching out to these communities privately to initiate collaboration. The goal is to gather feedback and identify potential hosts for the events.To start the survey, Antoine listed several English or French-speaking countries in Africa, including Algeria, Cameroon, Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Togo, and Uganda. Once feedback is received, the next step will involve privately surveying senior Lightning developers to address any potential visa issues and determine a country that can gather consensus.Overall, the proposal received positive feedback from the Lightning-dev community, with nully0x expressing support for the idea and suggesting connecting with existing communities as a first step. This approach aims to bootstrap the planning process and ensure successful organization of the LN Summit in Africa.</summary>
