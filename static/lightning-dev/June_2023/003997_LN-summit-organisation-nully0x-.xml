    <summary>The Lightning-dev mailing list received a proposal from Antoine Riard regarding the organization of LN Summit 2024 in Africa. Antoine highlights several reasons for choosing Africa as the location, including its cultural and historical significance, fragmented financial systems that can benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and the potential for local Lightning economies to thrive.Antoine acknowledges that it is not customary to announce the organization of CoreDev or LN Summit on public channels. However, due to the operational challenges that may arise, such as visa travels and tropical weather, he believes it is best to announce the event well in advance. He suggests taking a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency throughout the process.To begin the planning process, Antoine proposes surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that could serve as potential locations for the summit. Some of the countries mentioned include Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, and others. Antoine plans to privately share the feedback with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics by the end of the summer.Antoine also provides a dedicated communication endpoint (lnsummit2024@ariard.me) for those interested in participating in the organization of LN Summit 2024. He encourages Lightning developers to reach out and take part in this opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.In response to Antoine's proposal, nully0x expresses support and suggests connecting with existing Bitcoin and lightning network communities in Africa, such as Qala Africa and BitDevs community in East and West African countries, to facilitate the planning process.Overall, the proposal to organize LN Summit 2024 in Africa has been positively received, and efforts are underway to explore potential host countries and gather feedback from Lightning developers.</summary>
