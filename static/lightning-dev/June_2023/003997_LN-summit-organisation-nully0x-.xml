    <summary>The Lightning-dev mailing list received a proposal from Antoine Riard to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. Antoine highlighted the reasons why Africa would be a suitable location for the summit, including its rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that can benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and the potential for local Lightning economies. Due to the operational challenges involved, such as visa travels and tropical weather, Antoine decided to announce the organization of the event ahead of time to ensure smooth planning. He also mentioned the need for a multi-stakeholder approach to guarantee fairness and transparency in the process. Antoine invited feedback and objections to his contribution to the organization of the LN Summit and emphasized his commitment to maintaining strong transparency and accountability standards.To start small, Antoine suggested surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that could serve as potential locations for the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He plans to share the feedback privately with the Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics at the end of the summer. Antoine set up a dedicated communication endpoint (lnsummit2024 at ariard.me) for anyone interested in being part of the organization or transferring knowledge between generations of contributors. The proposal was well-received by nully0x, who suggested connecting with existing Bitcoin and Lightning network communities in Africa, such as Qala Africa and BitDevs, as a first step in the planning process.</summary>
