    <summary>Antoine Riard, a member of the Lightning dev community, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. He believes that Africa is an ideal location for the summit due to its rich cultural and historical past, fragmented financial systems that could benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and the potential for local Lightning economies to thrive. Antoine acknowledges the operational challenges involved in hosting the summit in Africa, such as visa requirements and tropical weather, and suggests announcing the event well in advance to address these challenges effectively. He also emphasizes the importance of transparency and accountability in the organization process, welcoming objections or feedback from the community. To start the planning process, Antoine proposes surveying countries with reasonable operational stability in Africa, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, among others. He plans to share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics. Antoine invites Lightning developers interested in contributing to the organization of the summit to reach out, seeing it as an opportunity for knowledge transfer between generations of contributors. In addition, there are existing Bitcoin communities across Africa that organize local meetups focused on technical sessions around Bitcoin and the Lightning Network, such as Qala Africa and BitDevs communities in East and West African countries. Antoine suggests connecting with these communities first to bootstrap the planning process.Overall, Antoine's proposal to host the LN Summit in Africa has been met with enthusiasm within the Lightning dev community, and he is taking steps to gather feedback and ensure a transparent and inclusive organization process.</summary>
