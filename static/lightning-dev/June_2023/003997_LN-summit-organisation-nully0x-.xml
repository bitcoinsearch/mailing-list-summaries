    <summary>Antoine Riard, a member of the Lightning dev community, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. Africa is seen as an ideal location due to its rich cultural heritage, fragmented financial systems, and a growing number of Lightning developers. Antoine acknowledges the potential challenges, such as obtaining visas and dealing with tropical weather, but believes that announcing the event early will help address these issues. The organization of the summit will prioritize transparency and accountability, with a multi-stakeholder approach encouraged for fairness. To begin the planning process, Antoine suggests surveying countries with operational stability, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, among others. He also invites Lightning developers to join the organization and share their knowledge. Various Bitcoin communities across Africa, like Qala Africa and BitDevs, already organize local meetups focusing on technical sessions related to Bitcoin and the Lightning network. Antoine proposes connecting with these communities first to facilitate the planning process. Overall, the goal is to create a successful LN Summit in Africa, leveraging the continent's potential for Lightning economies and fostering collaboration between generations of contributors.</summary>
