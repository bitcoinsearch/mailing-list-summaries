    <summary>The Lightning-dev mailing list received a proposal from Antoine Riard to organize the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. Antoine highlighted the reasons for choosing Africa, including its cultural richness, fragmented financial systems that can benefit from a compatible payment protocol, a growing number of Lightning developers from the continent, and the potential for local Lightning economies to thrive. Due to the operational challenges involved in organizing an event in Africa, Antoine decided to announce the summit early and encouraged a multi-stakeholder approach for fairness and transparency. He also mentioned that he had already co-organized the CoreDev event in Zurich in 2021, demonstrating his experience in event organization.Antoine suggested starting small by surveying countries with stable operations that could be suitable locations for the summit, such as Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. He plans to share the feedback privately with Lightning attendees based on neutral and technical proof of works heuristics at the end of the summer. Antoine provided a dedicated communication endpoint (lnsummit2024@ariard.me) for LN developers interested in being part of the organization and transferring knowledge between generations of contributors.In response to Antoine's proposal, nully0x acknowledged the importance of connecting with existing Bitcoin and lightning network communities in Africa, such as Qala Africa and BitDevs communities in East and West African countries. Nully0x suggested reaching out to these communities first to bootstrap planning for the summit. The conversation continued privately between Antoine and nully0x.Overall, the proposal received positive feedback, and the community expressed enthusiasm for the idea of organizing the LN Summit in Africa.</summary>
