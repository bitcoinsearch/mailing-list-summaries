    <summary>Antoine Riard, a member of the Lightning-dev community, has proposed organizing the LN Summit in Africa in June 2024. Africa is seen as an ideal location due to its rich cultural history, fragmented financial systems that can be solved with a compatible payment protocol, and the growing number of Lightning developers on the continent. However, given the potential operational challenges such as visa travels and tropical weather, it is important to announce the event well in advance. The organization of the summit should ideally have a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure fairness and transparency.To start the planning process, Antoine suggests surveying countries with reasonable operational stability that are suitable for hosting the event, including Algeria, Ghana, Senegal, Nigeria, and others. He plans to gather feedback from these countries and share it privately with Lightning attendees by the end of the summer. Antoine has set up a dedicated communication endpoint (lnsummit2024@ariard.me) for anyone interested in participating in the organization of the summit, as it presents an opportunity to transfer knowledge between generations of contributors.It is also mentioned that various local communities across Africa, such as Qala Africa and BitDevs, organize meetups focused on technical sessions around Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. It is suggested to connect with these communities first to bootstrap the planning process.Overall, Antoine's proposal to organize the LN Summit in Africa has received positive feedback, and efforts are underway to survey potential host countries and engage senior Lightning developers.</summary>
