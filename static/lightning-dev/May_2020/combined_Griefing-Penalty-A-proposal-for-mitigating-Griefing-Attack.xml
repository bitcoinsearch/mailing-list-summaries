    <summary>The issue of soft-griefing attacks in Bitcoin was discussed in a recent email exchange. The current instructions make it difficult to settle disputes related to these attacks, where a party withholds the preimage for a long time but releases it just before the expiration of locktime. ZmnSCPxj argues that "soft" griefing is actually the griefing attack expected to occur on the network and proposes that closing and re-establishing channels is expensive for attackers. However, there is currently no way to punish the receiver if they cancel the payment just before the lock time.ZmnSCPxj raises concerns about the effectiveness of the Griefing-Penalty as a solution to Reverse-Griefing attack. He argues that the penalty cannot prevent the former without causing the latter. On the other hand, Subhra et al. proposed an efficient countermeasure for mitigating griefing attacks in Bitcoin-compatible PCNs, known as Griefing-Penalty. Their contribution includes proposing a new payment protocol called HTLC-GP or Hashed Timelock Contract with Griefing-Penalty, which compensates honest nodes for their loss due to griefing attack. The Griefing-Penalty strategy requires both parties to lock funds in an off-chain contract, where one party locks the amount to be forwarded, and the other party locks the fund, which can be claimed as a penalty if this party grieves.ZmnSCPxj seeks clarification on a proposal for mitigating reverse-griefing. The proposal document is linked in the email. A proposed countermeasure to mitigate griefing attacks in Bitcoin-compatible payment channel networks (PCNs) has been presented in a recent paper titled "Griefing-Penalty: Countermeasure for Griefing Attack in Bitcoin-compatible PCNs". The authors propose a strategy called "Griefing-Penalty", which compensates intermediaries affected by the attack. The loss incurred upon mounting a griefing attack is proportional to the collateral cost of each channel involved in routing the payment.The authors illustrate the benefit of the proposed countermeasure with a new payment protocol called HTLC-GP (Hashed Timelock Contract with Griefing-Penalty), and provide a security analysis that proves the protocol is privacy-preserving while mitigating losses due to griefing attacks by compensating honest nodes. An off-chain contract is established between two parties where both parties lock funds, with one party locking the amount to be forwarded and the other party locking the fund claimable as a penalty if it grieves. The penalty locked is proportional to the product of the amount being forwarded and the expiration time of the contract, and all parties affected by griefing must receive compensation since their liquidity is tied up for a certain period.</summary>
