    <summary>The Lightning Network is a technology that aims to improve the scalability of blockchain networks but has a weakness in its architecture due to the lack of routing tables. This creates difficulties for the sender to choose an efficient next recipient to reach the ultimate receiver. The mesh network routing problem remains unsolved, and no solution has been found yet. Despite this challenge, many still hope for the success of the Lightning Network. The current solution used by the Lightning Network is direct but costly as each node needs to keep a view of the entire network, making it difficult for low-end devices to keep local network views. A solution to the mesh network routing problem could be self-addressing packets, much like IP. The discussion raises the question of who controls the internet's routing table and whether it operates as a mesh network.</summary>
