    <summary>The Lightning Network aims to improve blockchain network scalability, but its lack of routing tables poses a challenge for choosing the most efficient path. However, the current spec has each participant sharing their view of the entire graph with each other, eliminating guesswork and making it impossible to fake a channel without committing money into a UTXO. Self-addressing packets, similar to IP, could solve the mesh network routing problem. The use of SDN technologies, such as OpenFlow, is being considered for creating network configurations managed at the L7 OSI application layer. A solution to the Lightning Network's lack of routing tables has yet to be found, raising questions about who controls the internet's routing table and whether it operates as a mesh network. Eclair developers may provide insights on whether the network map is already too large for mobile devices. Despite these challenges, many still hope for the success of the Lightning Network.</summary>
