    <summary>The Lightning network is a protocol that facilitates fast and cheap transactions of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Currently, in order to send a payment through the Lightning network, an invoice from the receiver is required. However, there may be situations where one wants to make a spontaneous payment as a gift without the need for an invoice. A proposal has been made to allow for such spontaneous payments within the Lightning network by routing the payment to the intended recipient's node using a special form of encrypted routing message that includes a preimage and potentially other data such as a signed description.If the receiving node recognizes the format, it can use the preimage to complete the transaction or cancel it if unsolicited funds are received. This new protocol offers advantages over the existing "payment to self" method, including simpler routing and the ability to include a small message with the payment. The proposed solution has been outlined in a GitHub issue and a "brain storm" wiki on the Request for Comments repository.In the new protocol, none of the intermediate nodes can steal funds since the routing data is encrypted. Spontaneous payments can also be made with a "payment to self", but the proposed solution has advantages such as not needing the second half of the route and allowing for a small message to be included. This new feature could make Lightning network transactions even more convenient and user-friendly, especially for those who wish to make spontaneous payments as gifts or donations without the need for an invoice.</summary>
