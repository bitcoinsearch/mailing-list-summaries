    <summary>The Lightning-dev mailing list is a forum for discussing issues related to Lightning Network technology. The discussions held on June 23, 2018, centered around various topics. Praveen Baratam enquired if it is possible for the authors or inventors of Second Level Protocols like the Lightning Network to patent them. Tim Blokdijk replied that in the EU, such inventions cannot be patented since mathematical methods and computer programs are excluded from patents. Joseph Hoane raised concerns about the lack of routing tables in the Lightning Network, making it challenging to choose an efficient path for the next recipient. ZmnSCPxj responded that the current spec has each participant share their views of the entire graph with each other, so the payer uses its own local view of the network to create a route from payer to payee, eliminating the need for intermediate nodes to keep routing tables. Additionally, each channel includes a reference to the UTXO backing it, and a signature matching the 2-of-2 multisig is required to prove the existence of these channels.Oleg Sadov suggested using SDN technologies, such as OpenFlow, to manage network configurations. He argued that this can be useful for building SDN-enabled Blockchain modelling NW environments. However, ZmnSCPxj mentioned that the mesh network routing problem, in general, can be solved by self-addressing packets or offering a forwarding fee. This reveals the destination of the payment, which is why Lightning went with onion routing. In conclusion, the Lightning-dev mailing list serves as a platform for discussing various issues related to Lightning Network technology. The discussions on June 23, 2018, addressed topics such as patentability of Second Level Protocols, efficient path selection without routing tables, and the use of SDN technologies in managing network configurations.</summary>
