    <summary>The Lightning Network team has proposed several improvements to the pathfinding algorithm of their payment system, as current algorithms are not sufficient for the size of the network. They have proposed an alternative algorithm called `permuteroute` which is faster and helpful in supporting JIT-Routing nodes. The latest version of the software factors in past pathfinding attempts into its central "mission control," allowing it to learn from each attempt. A new `getroutequick` command can be implemented to speed up payment routing to arbitrary nodes. Additionally, A* algorithm can also be used on Lightning if we have precomputed and cached the costs from a node to all other nodes.The Lightning Network is proposing a new routing algorithm called Trampoline Routing that aims to reduce the amount of computation needed for pathfinding. The team proposes dividing the network into two separate maps: a "smooth" map and a "rough" map. Trusted Rough Maps are also proposed, which involve centralized trusted servers providing rough maps to nodes with extremely limited space. Self-Serving servers can also provide rough maps using free and open source software. Myopic Trampoline Nodes are also proposed, which involve nodes keeping only a small portion of the global routemap in memory.The author argues that trampoline nodes should be allowed to advertise themselves even if they don't have a complete smooth-level routemap. The author then discusses flocking, which is a technique used in real-time strategy games where a player needs to immediately send a large group of units to a location. The solution is to select one unit as the leader and have only the leader request a path, while the other units "flock" around that leader. The author applies this concept to Lightning Network payments, specifically split payments using AMP/Multi-part/Bass Amplifier.Overall, the Lightning Network does not need to pioneer new research into pathfinding. Instead, real-time strategy game programming techniques deserve closer examination as potential points of inspiration for similar techniques for Lightning. Engineers should focus on low hanging engineering fruits and incremental algorithmic updates rather than getting distracted by distant ideas.</summary>
