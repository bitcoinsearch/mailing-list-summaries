    <summary>In an email exchange, Jeremy asked about going on chain when reaching sequence limits in an Eltoo channel. The response was that for the final update, one could sign a move to a new update key and do a continuation where an extra transaction is added to the uncooperative path every 2**30 states. However, this approach adds CSV layers and increases resolution time linearly. Using the CLTV path instead of the CSV path is recommended. Jeremy suggested signing an eltoo "trampoline," which would allow for closing channels with a single additional update to the factory once bored. However, a Taproot tree with N copies of the state update protocol is more cost-effective and allows for more privacy regarding how many state updates were made throughout the protocol. Constructing scripts carefully and keeping the trees the same size can achieve this. The script leaves may only provide 5 bits of added sequence space, but adding four merkle branches at 32B each and revealing the pubkey for 33B can get up to 2**34 states (4 added bits of added sequence space) for about 161 extra bytes.</summary>
