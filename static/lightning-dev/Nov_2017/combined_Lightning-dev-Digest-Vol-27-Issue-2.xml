    <summary>Louis Willcock recently asked Rusty Russell about his thoughts on why BIP70 is not widely used, especially in reference to the BIP 70-72 collection. Russell believes that it is because BIP70 does not offer significant advantages over existing bitcoin addresses. However, he stated that Lightning Network required a unique format which justified the creation of a dedicated format.In a Lightning-dev mailing list, Russell answered some questions about the Lightning Network's payment protocol. Regarding handling payments from users who may or may not use LN, Russell suggested using a BOLT 11 QR code which can contain a fallback address. However, this still requires their app to understand BOLT11 enough to extract it. Alternatively, the BIP70 payment protocol could include an alternate payment mechanism, but it seems nobody actually uses this.Russell also discussed payment delays due to someone in the middle not cooperating fast enough. He recommended waiting or trying again with a new invoice if the payment has failed. For version 1.1, users would be able to reuse the same invoice safely as long as the merchant was honest if it received two payments and rejects the second. If it hasn't failed yet, you'll get your goods and don't care that you have to wait for the money to be deducted.Lastly, Russell talked about the decremental time lock which is closely related to block confirmation time. He explained that even if there was a currency with very fast confirmation times, the time lock period could not be too short because a margin is still needed to turn around payments. In practice, if payments are so unreliable that one has to worry about this case, then something is horribly wrong!</summary>
