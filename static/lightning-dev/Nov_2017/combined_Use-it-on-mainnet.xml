    <summary>The email conversation between Mark Friedenbach and Cezary Dziemian discusses the current state of Bitcoin payments system, which is facing issues due to high fees and unconfirmed transactions. Dziemian suggests that Lightning Network (LN) should be implemented as soon as possible as it is the only solution to this problem. However, Friedenbach mentions that teams are waiting for cross-implementation comparability to be demonstrated before announcing any deployment to customers. He suggests that more tests may be needed before LN can be used in the mainnet.Dziemian's message enquires about the current readiness of LN implementation for deployment on the mainnet of cryptocurrencies. The mainnet refers to the live blockchain network of a cryptocurrency. LN is a layer-two scaling solution for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies aimed at increasing transaction speed and reducing fees. It operates by creating payment channels between users that allow for instant, off-chain transactions. However, there are multiple implementations of LN available, such as LND, c-lightning, and Eclair, and the question posed by Dziemian highlights concerns about their readiness for deployment on the mainnet.Overall, the email conversation emphasizes the need for further testing and development of LN implementation before its deployment on the mainnet. This indicates that there may be some technical issues or challenges that need to be addressed to ensure the readiness of LN for deployment on the mainnet. Therefore, teams are waiting for cross-implementation comparability to be demonstrated before announcing any deployment to customers.</summary>
