    <summary>The email thread discusses various aspects of Lightning Network implementation and usage, including scenarios related to LN usage and responses from Rusty Russell and Johan Torås Halseth. Cezary Dziemian has questions regarding the functionality of the Lightning Network (LN), including how to receive payments using LN if some users prefer on-chain payments instead and what to do if someone in the middle of an LN payment does not cooperate quickly, causing a payment to be stuck in limbo until the time lock period lapses. Rusty suggests using a BOLT 11 QR code with a fallback address or the BIP70 payment protocol with an alternate payment mechanism. Johan suggests adding a lightning parameter to the bitcoin: url to make QR codes backwards compatible. Rusty explains the difficulties faced with LN in terms of payments, including concerns regarding how to verify if a user is using LN or not when making a payment. Rusty also acknowledges that there may be cases where a payment might fail due to a non-cooperative party in the middle, but assures him that it is rare. He suggests that if the payment has succeeded, then the recipient will receive the goods regardless of the delay. On the other hand, if it fails, the payer can wait or try again with a new invoice, but cannot pay the same one twice unless it definitely failed. Rusty also explains that although the decremental time lock is somewhat related to block confirmation time, if payments are so unreliable that this case needs to be worried about, then something is horribly wrong.Cezary expresses gratitude for the response to his previous inquiry and mentions that the LN is believed to be the next big thing in Poland with a huge pro-LN community and translated LN whitepaper to Polish. He also asks if it would be possible for a payer to make two payments based on the same invoice under a particular scenario. Rusty responds that this scenario would not be possible because the payer's wallet would refuse to make two payments to the same payment_hash until one has failed. Rusty advises Cezary to ask the merchant for another invoice instead of trying to make another payment using the same invoice.</summary>
