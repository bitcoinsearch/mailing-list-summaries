    <summary>Alan Carbery, a developer, sought clarification from Rusty Russell regarding the bi-directionality of channels in Lightning network. While most tutorials describe the channels as bi-directional, Alan was puzzled about the funding mechanism. He wondered if each channel is funded by one party only because the `funding_satoshis` attribute is present in `open_channel` but not in `accept_channel`. Rusty responded that the channels are bidirectional and payments can be made in both directions assuming some initial payments are made. Each side of the channel sends a batch of updates followed by a commitment, and then the other side replies with an acknowledgement.It was confirmed that each channel in Lightning network is funded by one party only, but payments can be made in both directions. The `push_msat` field allows for an initial payment to be made as part of the channel opening. One-sided channel funding was chosen for simplicity in version 1.0 of the protocol. However, a pull request for dual funding is currently being worked on and can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/184.</summary>
