    <summary>A developer named Alan Carbery asked Rusty Russell, a member of the Lightning Network team, about the bi-directionality of the network's channels. Despite the draft RFC suggesting that the protocol is uni-directional only, Rusty confirmed that the channels are actually bidirectional. Each side of the channel sends a batch of updates followed by a commitment, and then the other side replies with an acknowledgement, allowing both sides to operate independently.In a separate discussion on channel funding, it was established that each channel is funded by one party only, but payments can be made in both directions using the `push_msat` field. One-sided channel funding was chosen for simplicity in version 1.0 of the protocol, but a pull request for dual funding is currently being worked on and can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/184.Alan had reached out to Rusty seeking clarification about the Lightning Network's channel funding mechanism. He wondered if each channel is funded by one party only, even though tutorials show examples where both parties put funds into the funding transaction. Rusty explained that the channels are indeed bidirectional and that the funding_satoshis attribute in the open_channel specification is used for one-sided channel funding. Rusty also stated that the one-sided funding approach was chosen for simplicity in the first release of the protocol.</summary>
