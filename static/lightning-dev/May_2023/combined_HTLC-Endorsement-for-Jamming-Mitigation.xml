    <summary>In an email thread on the Lightning-dev mailing list, there was a discussion about reputation systems in the Lightning Network. One concern raised was that reputation systems are not reliable due to sudden behavioral changes and whitewashing attacks. However, it was suggested that choosing a counterparty with a proven track record may be better than choosing a newcomer. The placement of reputation systems in the software stack was also discussed, with the suggestion that they should be a separate API or plugin rather than part of the protocol or P2P gossiping. Privacy concerns were mentioned as a reason why some users might choose not to participate in reputation services.Regarding reputation schemes for mitigating channel jamming, the proposal was for nodes to track the reputation of their direct neighbors and allocate slots and liquidity based on their risk tolerance. High reputation peers would be given priority in forwarding HTLCs, while unknown HTLCs would only be forwarded if there are available resources. It was emphasized that reputation and endorsement form the first step in a two-part scheme for mitigating channel jamming.Data gathering was considered valuable for future simulation work and experimenting with different algorithms for tracking local reputation. It was concluded that reputation is not a protocol/P2P gossiping issue, but interesting projects and services can still be developed in the area of reputation.The Lightning-dev mailing list was highlighted as an important resource for developers and enthusiasts involved in Lightning technology. Users were encouraged to join the mailing list for updates and notifications about new posts and discussions.In the email thread, the distinction between routing fees and reputation revenue in the HTLC endorsement model was discussed. It was noted that reputation gained today cannot be used in the distant future, and continuous investment is required to maintain a good reputation. Nodes do not gossip about their peers' reputation, but only communicate whether an HTLC is endorsed or neutral.The vulnerability of the HTLC endorsement scheme was addressed, highlighting the need for reputational transitivity between incoming and outgoing traffic channels. The acquisition cost of local reputation should be equal to the maximum time-value damage that can be inflicted on a routing node channel accessible from its local counterparty granting this high level of reputation.The email thread also mentioned upcoming calls for channel jamming, where data gathering would take place to mitigate jamming. The goals included observing the effect of a logging-only implementation, gathering real-world data for future simulation work, and experimenting with different algorithms for tracking local reputation.Overall, the discussion emphasized the challenges and uncertainties involved in implementing effective routing and compensation systems in the Lightning Network, particularly in relation to reputation and HTLC endorsement.The Lightning Network community is actively working on mitigating channel jamming attacks through a reputation scheme. The reputation will be tracked locally for each node's peers based on their history with forwarded HTLCs. Nodes will allocate slots and liquidity reserved for endorsed HTLCs from high reputation peers. The two-part scheme involves reputation and endorsement as the first step. Data gathering efforts are underway to observe the effect of endorsement and experiment with different algorithms for tracking local reputation. The discussion also covers the vulnerability issues of the endorsement scheme and the importance of differentiating between fees charged and reputation revenue. The Lightning-dev mailing list serves as a platform for discussing and developing Lightning Network projects, and joining the list can be done through a provided link. Overall, the community aims to improve the security and scalability of the Lightning Network through ongoing research and collaboration.The conversation revolves around the topic of local-only reputation based systems in the context of the Lightning Network. The speaker is interested in understanding how many repeat interactions nodes get from individual senders, as it helps in understanding the use of these systems. The impact of an attack on large routing nodes is discussed, with the assumption that there is sufficient data available for them to make informed decisions. However, the edges may be more vulnerable, but they are used by fewer senders, and the impact of an attack would also be proportionally smaller. A clarification is sought on what is meant by "individual senders," and it is explained that nodes track their history with all Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) a peer has forwarded to them, not whether they come from repeat senders. There is confusion about mixing two different proposals, and an apology is given. It is agreed that nodes that forward fewer HTLCs are less likely to build a good reputation with very active routing nodes. However, during regular network operations, this should have little to no impact on their activity. During an attack, small and low-activity nodes will temporarily compete for large routing nodes' scarce liquidity and slots but can still interact with similar nodes where they have better chances of building a good reputation.The email thread discusses the vulnerability of the HTLC endorsement scheme due to the lack of transitivity of the reputation acquisition cost between payment path hops. To address this issue, the scheme should aim for reputational transitivity between incoming traffic and outgoing traffic. The acquisition cost of local reputation should be equal to the maximum</summary>
