    <summary>The Lightning Network community is proposing a reputation scheme to mitigate channel jamming attacks. The scheme involves tracking local reputation for each node's peers based on their history of HTLC forwarding. Reputation is slow and expensive to build but degrades quickly, allowing for short-lived changes in behavior. The community plans to gather data on the use of HTLC endorsement and local reputation tracking to evaluate its effectiveness and experiment with different algorithms. The goal is to develop a two-step scheme for mitigating channel jamming. However, there are concerns about the reliability of reputation systems and their vulnerability to sudden behavioral changes and whitewashing attacks.In response to skepticism about reputation systems, Antoine Riard suggests that HTLC endorsement schemes can still be vulnerable due to the built-up reputation during low routing fees being abused during high fees. He recommends establishing reputational transitivity between incoming and outgoing traffic channels and adapting upfront fees or reputation acquisition costs based on market forces. Carla Kirk-Cohen shares updates on gathering data for jamming mitigation and proposes allocating slots reserved for endorsed HTLCs from high reputation peers based on risk tolerance.There is also a discussion about where reputation systems should sit in the software stack and whether they should be a separate API or plugin rather than a protocol or P2P gossiping issue. Privacy concerns are raised as a potential barrier to participation in reputation services.Overall, the Lightning-dev mailing list serves as a platform for discussing and developing the Lightning Network, providing a space for collaboration and innovation. Users can join the list by visiting the provided link and signing up with their email address.The discussion revolves around the HTLC endorsement scheme in the Lightning Network and its vulnerability to reputation-based attacks. The lack of transitivity in reputation acquisition cost between payment path hops is highlighted, raising concerns about the potential for nodes to sacrifice reputation to inflict damage on other nodes' incoming links. Differentiating between routing fees and reputation revenue is emphasized, with the example of Caroll and Bob illustrating the decision-making process based on reliability and potential jamming attacks.The conversation also touches on the impact of dynamic reputation windows on payment reliability and the potential disruption to historical liquidity buckets in routing scoring algorithms. Gossiping about reputations in a decentralized network is discussed, emphasizing the need to avoid discrepancies and false reputations. Additionally, the overloaded Tor network is mentioned as a source of unrealistic perceptions about node availability.An email update discusses the upcoming call for channel jamming, outlining the agenda and mentioning data gathering efforts to mitigate jamming. Different algorithms for tracking local reputation are proposed, with a focus on observing the effect of logging-only implementation and gathering real-world data. The two-part scheme involving reputation and unconditional fees for mitigating channel jamming is outlined, along with the allocation of slots and liquidity reserved for endorsed HTLCs from high reputation peers.The vulnerability of the endorsement scheme due to the lack of transitivity in reputation acquisition cost is further emphasized in the email thread. The importance of differentiation between fees and reputation revenue is reiterated, with reputation revenue used to estimate the damage an attacker can create. The effect of sudden changes in link throughput on historical liquidity buckets is observed, potentially affecting payment reliability. The limitation of nodes only communicating whether an HTLC is endorsed or neutral is mentioned, with nodes not gossiping about their peers' reputations.Overall, the Lightning Network community is actively working towards mitigating channel jamming and exploring various schemes and reputation algorithms. The discussion highlights the challenges and uncertainties involved in implementing effective routing and compensation systems in the context of the HTLC endorsement model.The email thread discusses the challenges and vulnerabilities associated with the HTLC endorsement model in the Lightning Network. The lack of transitivity of reputation acquisition cost between payment path hops creates a vulnerability for the endorsement scheme, as nodes can sacrifice their earned reputation to inflict a loss of routing fees on another node's incoming link. However, it is important to differentiate between routing fees and reputation revenue, as reputation is determined by the latter. The email suggests that nodes should set a higher bar than reputation revenue if they consider having a high reputation with another node crucial.There is also a discussion on the effect of dynamic reputation windows on payment reliability. Sudden changes in link throughput based on HTLC resolution might break the historical liquidity buckets of routing scoring algorithms, which could affect payment reliability. However, the exact implications of this are uncertain.The email provides updates on the upcoming call for channel jamming, scheduled for May 1st. The goals of the call include observing the effect of logging-only implementation in steady state and gathering real-world data for future simulation work. Different algorithms for tracking local reputation will also be experimented with. The email outlines the minimal changes required to add HTLC endorsement, suggesting a binary endorsement field to start with. As more is learned, a more expressive value may be required, possibly using an experimental TLV value.The proposed two-part scheme for mitigating channel jamming involves reputation for slow jams that are easily detected as misbehavior and unconditional fees for quick</summary>
