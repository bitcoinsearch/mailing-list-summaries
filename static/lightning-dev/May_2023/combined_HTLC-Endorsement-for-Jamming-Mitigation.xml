    <summary>The email thread on the Lightning-dev mailing list discusses various aspects of the HTLC endorsement system and its effectiveness in mitigating channel jamming. The conversation highlights the need for a compensation mechanism that fully economically compensates routing node operators for the damage inflicted by jamming attacks. There is also a discussion about the distinction between routing fees and reputation revenue in the endorsement model, with concerns raised about the clarity of the compensation mechanism and the potential coupling effects between historical liquidity buckets and the introduction of the endorsement scheme.The speakers emphasize the importance of rigorous analysis and evaluation of any proposed jamming solution, suggesting that it should be evaluated with the same conceptual rigor as modern cryptanalysis. They argue that without such analysis, it would be difficult to set measurable bounds for the effectiveness of any solution and prevent potential harm to routing node operators.In addition, there is a mention of the LDK scoring engine comments, which provide further insights into channel liquidity and fluctuation in the context of HTLC routing traffic.The conversation also touches upon the need for simulations to evaluate the potential downgrade of HTLC routing traffic due to the fluctuation caused by the endorsement system. It is acknowledged that any proposed jamming solution may have downsides on routing traffic success, but the trade-offs are hard to determine without proper analysis and evaluation.Overall, the email thread highlights the need for cautious deployment of half-baked jamming mitigations and emphasizes the importance of thorough analysis and evaluation to ensure the effectiveness and reliability of any proposed solution.In the Lightning-dev mailing list, there is a discussion about reputation systems in the Lightning Network and its potential vulnerabilities. Christian expresses skepticism about the usefulness of reputation systems due to their susceptibility to sudden behavioral changes and whitewashing attacks. Antoine suggests establishing reputational transitivity between incoming and outgoing traffic to address vulnerabilities in the HTLC endorsement scheme. Carla provides updates on channel jamming and proposes gathering data on HTLC endorsement and local reputation tracking for jamming mitigation. The Lightning Network community is actively working towards mitigating channel jamming and experimenting with various schemes and reputation algorithms.The HTLC endorsement scheme proposed in the Lightning Network has a vulnerability where local reputation can be built up during low routing fees and then abused when fees are high. To prevent this, reputational transitivity between incoming and outgoing traffic is necessary. The acquisition cost of local reputation should be equal to the maximum time-value damage that one can inflict on a routing node channel accessible from its local counterparty granting this high-level of reputation.The Lightning Network community is proposing a reputation scheme to mitigate channel jamming attacks. Reputation will be tracked locally for each peer, and nodes will track local reputation based on their history with all HTLCs forwarded to them. The reputation is slow and expensive to build and fast to degrade, ensuring that sudden changes in behavior are short-lived. Gathering data on repeat interactions from individual senders is important to understand the use of local-only reputation-based systems.There is a discussion about the impact of an attack on large routing nodes and the competition for liquidity and slots during an attack. It is mentioned that small and low-activity nodes can still interact with similar nodes where they have better chances of building a good reputation. Differentiating between fees charged by a node and their reputation revenue is emphasized, as reputation is determined as a function of the latter.The conversation also addresses concerns about the lack of transitivity of the reputation acquisition cost and the vulnerability of the endorsement scheme. The compensation mechanism for nodes with high reputation and the impact of dynamic reputation windows on payment reliability are discussed.In another email thread, there is a discussion about the usefulness of reputation systems in the Lightning Network and the possibility of writing an extension to deploy to nodes using an implementation like CLN. There is also a suggestion to create an experimental data gathering mechanism for CLN using lnmetrics as a platform.Overall, the Lightning Network community is actively working on mitigating channel jamming attacks and experimenting with different schemes and reputation algorithms. Data gathering and analysis are seen as valuable in understanding the effectiveness of reputation-based systems and making informed decisions.The discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list revolves around the challenges and potential solutions for mitigating channel jamming in the Lightning Network. The group is exploring the use of HTLC endorsement and reputation as a two-part scheme to address this issue. However, there are concerns about the vulnerability of the endorsement scheme and the need for reputational transitivity between incoming and outgoing traffic channels. Data gathering and experimentation with different algorithms for tracking local reputation are seen as valuable for future simulation work. The email also includes updates on an upcoming call to discuss channel jamming and invites participants to join. Overall, the community is actively working towards finding effective solutions to improve the security and reliability of the Lightning Network.The Lightning Network community is actively working towards mitigating channel jamming by proposing a reputation scheme. The team aims to gather data on the use of HTLC endorsement and local reputation tracking for jamming mitigation. They suggest starting with a binary endorsement field</summary>
