    <summary>There is ongoing discussion and debate within the Lightning Network community regarding reputation systems and their use in mitigating channel jamming attacks. The proposed HTLC endorsement scheme aims to address the issue of reputation abuse during high routing fees but has its own vulnerabilities. The community recognizes the need for a rigorous analysis and evaluation of any jamming mitigation solution to ensure its effectiveness and minimize unintended consequences.In the email thread, there is a discussion about the compensation mechanism in the HTLC endorsement scheme. The author raises concerns about whether the fees paid fully compensate for the damage inflicted on the victim of a jamming attack. The email clarifies that the only observable damage in the protocol is routing fees and suggests that different thresholds can be chosen based on a node's preference. The email also addresses the question of whether the compensation ratio between fees and reputation is static or dynamic. It explains that if the compensation is proportional, the criteria for determining the ratio are not specified.The Lightning Network community is proposing a reputation scheme to mitigate channel jamming attacks. Reputation will be tracked locally for each of a node’s peers, with no gossip component involved. Nodes will track local reputation for their direct peers based on their history with all HTLCs a peer has forwarded to them. The reputation is slow and expensive to build and fast to degrade, so sudden changes in behavior are short-lived. Good reputation is always examined relative to a node’s recent routing activity.The Lightning Network community plans to gather data about the use of HTLC endorsement and local reputation tracking for jamming mitigation. They want to observe the effect of endorsement in the steady state with logging-only implementation, gather real-world data for use in future simulation work, and experiment with different algorithms for tracking local reputation. Each node locally tracks the reputation of its direct neighbors and allocates a number of slots reserved for endorsed HTLCs from high reputation peers and a portion of liquidity reserved for endorsed HTLCs from high reputation peers, per its risk tolerance. Forwarding of HTLCs will depend on whether they are endorsed by a high reputation peer, with endorsement and reputation proposed as the first step in a two-part scheme for mitigating channel jamming. Data gathering is also considered valuable for future simulation work and experimentation with different algorithms for tracking local reputation.The discussion on the mailing list is about whether reputation systems can provide security guarantees or just probabilistic judgments about future behavior. While reputation data can be better than nothing, it is susceptible to sudden behavioral changes and whitewashing attacks, making it unreliable for providing guarantees. However, in the most basic case of deciding on a potential channel counterparty, choosing one that has demonstrated competence and reliability over a number of years is better than choosing one who has just joined the network and is unknown.In terms of reputation schemes for mitigating channel jamming, the proposal is for each node to locally track the reputation of its direct neighbors and allocate slots and liquidity based on their risk tolerance. Endorsed HTLCs from high reputation peers will be given priority, while unknown HTLCs will only be forwarded if there are slots and liquidity available. Reputation and endorsement form the first step in a two-part scheme for mitigating channel jamming, with unconditional fees for quick jams being the second step. Data gathering is also considered valuable for future simulation work and experimentation with different algorithms for tracking local reputation.The conversation revolves around the topic of local-only reputation based systems. The speaker is interested in knowing how many repeat interactions nodes get from individual senders as it helps in understanding the use of these systems. The impact of an attack on large routing nodes is discussed, with the assumption that there is sufficient data available for them to make informed decisions. However, the edges may be more vulnerable, but they are used by fewer senders, and the impact of an attack would also be proportionally smaller. A clarification is sought on what is meant by "individual senders" since nodes only track local reputation for their direct peers. It is explained that nodes track their history with all HTLCs a peer has forwarded to them, not whether they come from repeat senders. The confusion about mixing two different proposals is acknowledged, and an apology is given. It is agreed that nodes that forward fewer HTLCs are less likely to build a good reputation with very active routing nodes. However, during regular network operations, this should have little to no impact on their activity. During an attack, small and low-activity nodes will temporarily compete for large routing nodes' scarce liquidity and slots but can still interact with similar nodes where they have better chances of building a good reputation.The conversation discusses the importance of differentiating between fees charged by a node and their reputation revenue in the HTLC endorsement model. The example used involves Caroll and Bob, who share the same parameters and have reputation revenue made from multiple incoming links. For each HTLC forwarding request issued from Alice, Bob has to decide between refusing Alice HTLC forward over the Caroll incoming link and losing</summary>
