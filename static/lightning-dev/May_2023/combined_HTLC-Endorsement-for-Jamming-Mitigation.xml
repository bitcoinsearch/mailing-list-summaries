    <summary>The Lightning Network community is actively working towards mitigating channel jamming attacks by proposing a two-part scheme involving HTLC endorsement and reputation tracking. The reputation is tracked locally for each node's peers based on their history with all HTLCs forwarded to them. This reputation is slow to build and fast to degrade, ensuring that sudden changes in behavior are short-lived. Nodes will allocate slots and liquidity reserved for endorsed HTLCs from high reputation peers. The community plans to gather data on the use of HTLC endorsement and local reputation tracking and experiment with different algorithms to evaluate the effectiveness of any jamming solution rigorously. They also discuss the importance of differentiating between fees charged by a node and reputation revenue in the endorsement model. The conversation explores the vulnerabilities of the endorsement scheme and the need for transitivity of reputation acquisition cost. Data gathering infrastructure and machine learning approaches are mentioned as valuable tools for understanding the network dynamics. The Lightning-dev mailing list serves as a platform for developers and enthusiasts to discuss and collaborate on Lightning Network projects. Reputation systems are considered valuable but require careful implementation and privacy considerations.In the discussion, there is a debate about the compensation mechanism in case of an attack on the Lightning Network. The speaker raises concerns about whether the fees paid fully compensate for the damage inflicted on the victim. The response suggests that the only observable damage in the protocol is routing fees, and it would be possible to choose a different threshold based on a node's preference. The compensation ratio between fees and reputation is discussed, with the suggestion that it could be static or dynamic based on certain criteria. However, further details on the specific criteria are not provided in the conversation.The conversation revolves around the topic of local-only reputation-based systems in the context of the Lightning Network. The speaker is interested in understanding how many repeat interactions nodes get from individual senders, as it helps in evaluating the effectiveness of these systems. They discuss the impact of an attack on large routing nodes and mention that there is sufficient data available for them to make informed decisions. However, they note that the edges may be more vulnerable but are used by fewer senders, resulting in a proportionally smaller impact of an attack. There is a clarification sought regarding the term "individual senders," and it is explained that nodes track their history with all HTLCs forwarded to them, not whether they come from repeat senders. The confusion about mixing two different proposals is acknowledged, and an apology is given. It is agreed that nodes forwarding fewer HTLCs are less likely to build a good reputation with very active routing nodes. However, during regular network operations, this should have little to no impact on their activity. In case of an attack, small and low-activity nodes will temporarily compete for large routing nodes' scarce liquidity and slots but can still interact with similar nodes where they have better chances of building a good reputation.The vulnerability of the HTLC endorsement scheme is discussed, where local reputation can be built up during periods of low routing fees and abused when fees are high. To address this issue, the scheme should aim for reputational transitivity between incoming and outgoing traffic channels. The acquisition cost of local reputation should be equal to the maximum time-value damage that one can inflict on a routing node channel accessible from its local counterparty granting this high level of reputation. It is emphasized that reputational transitivity needs to be ensured to prevent abuse during high-fee periods.The email thread discusses the vulnerability of the Lightning Network's endorsement scheme due to the lack of transitivity of the reputation acquisition cost between payment path hops. The reputation gained during low fee times cannot be used when fees are high. Nodes can go rogue, but the price of a good reputation aims to be similar to the amount of damage they can create. The effect of dynamic reputation windows on payment reliability is also observed. The Lightning Network uses fees as a native way to put a price on having a good reputation. Reputation gained today cannot be used in the distant future, and funds need to be continuously invested to maintain a good reputation.In another conversation, the speaker discusses the distinction between routing fees and reputation revenue in the HTLC endorsement model. They provide an example of two nodes, Caroll and Bob, and note that Bob must decide whether to accept or refuse an HTLC forwarding request from Alice based on their judgment of Alice's reliability and the potential for a jamming attack. The compensation mechanism in this scenario is unclear, and there may be coupling effects between historical liquidity buckets and the introduction of an endorsement scheme. Further information on the LDK scoring engine is provided through a link.The email update mentions an upcoming call for channel jamming and provides details for the meeting agenda. The gathering of data during these weekly calls to mitigate jamming is mentioned, with goals including observing the effect of logging-only implementation in steady state and collecting real-world data for future simulation work. Different algorithms for tracking local reputation will also be experimented with. The minimal changes required to add HTLC endorsement</summary>
