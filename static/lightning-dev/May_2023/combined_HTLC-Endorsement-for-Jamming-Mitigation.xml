    <summary>The email thread revolves around the Lightning Network's efforts to mitigate channel jamming with a two-part scheme involving HTLC endorsement and reputation. However, Antoine raises concerns about the vulnerabilities of the proposed HTLC endorsement scheme, suggesting that reputational transitivity is necessary between incoming and outgoing traffic. He believes that if a node gains reputation during low fee times, they cannot use it when fees are high. Carla provides updates on channel jamming, including data gathering efforts and the upcoming call. The community plans to gather data about the use of HTLC endorsement and local reputation tracking for jamming mitigation. They want to observe the effect of endorsement in the steady-state with logging-only implementation, gather real-world data for use in future simulation work, and experiment with different algorithms for tracking local reputation. Carla and Clara are looking forward to discussing a topic on the upcoming call. The proposal is for each node to locally track the reputation of its direct neighbors and allocate slots and liquidity based on their risk tolerance. Endorsed HTLCs from high reputation peers will be given priority, while unknown HTLCs will only be forwarded if there are slots and liquidity available. Reputation and endorsement form the first step in a two-part scheme for mitigating channel jamming, with unconditional fees for quick jams being the second step. Data gathering is also considered valuable for future simulation work and experimentation with different algorithms for tracking local reputation.The Lightning Network community is proposing a reputation scheme to mitigate channel jamming attacks. Reputation will be tracked locally for each of a node’s peers, with no gossip component involved. Nodes will track local reputation for their direct peers based on their history with all HTLCs a peer has forwarded to them. The reputation is slow and expensive to build and fast to degrade, so sudden changes in behavior are short-lived. Good reputation is always examined relative to a node’s recent routing activity.The discussion on the mailing list is about whether reputation systems can provide security guarantees or just probabilistic judgments about future behavior. While reputation data can be better than nothing, it is susceptible to sudden behavioral changes and whitewashing attacks, making it unreliable for providing guarantees. However, in the most basic case of deciding on a potential channel counterparty, choosing one that has demonstrated competence and reliability over a number of years is better than choosing one who has just joined the network and is unknown.The issue of where reputation systems sit on the software stack and how they are implemented is also discussed, with the suggestion that they should not be a protocol or P2P gossiping issue but rather a separate API or plugin. Many users may choose not to participate in such services due to privacy concerns.During regular network operation, nodes that forward fewer HTLCs are less likely to be able to build a good reputation with very active routing nodes. However, this should have low to no impact on their activity as they don’t require much from their peers anyway. Small and low activity nodes will temporarily be in competition for large routing nodes’ scarce liquidity and slots during an attack but will still be able to interact with similar nodes where they have better chances of building a good reputation.Finally, the conversation revolves around the topic of local-only reputation based systems, with the impact of an attack on large routing nodes being discussed. The email thread concludes with a discussion on how large routing nodes may have sufficient data for informed decisions, while edges may be more vulnerable, but they would also be used by fewer senders, making the impact of an attack proportionally smaller. Data collected from volunteers would hopefully provide more insight into these issues. The Lightning-dev mailing list is an important resource for those involved in the development and implementation of Lightning technology.</summary>
