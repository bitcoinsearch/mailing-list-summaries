    <summary>The Lightning Network project is making changes to improve its branding and organization. One suggestion made in a recent email thread was to create an official logo or avatar for the project. Olaoluwa Osuntokun proposed using an identicon or a symbol specific to the project, attaching a simple logo to the email chain. While no final decision has been made yet on whether to create an official logo or avatar, the lightning community is continuing to work towards improving the Github organization and reducing confusion around the open-source protocol and its implementations.In addition to discussing the creation of an official logo, the email thread also discussed updates to the Lightning Network GitHub organization. One major change involves separating the source code for Lightning Network Daemon (lnd) from the lightningnetwork Github page due to confusion between the open-source protocol and Lightning Labs. The proposal aims to move lnd's source code to another Github repository, such as lightninglabs, and create an independent repository owned by the community for the protocol specification.During a meeting in Milan, all developers converged on a single specification and added the BOLTs to the same repo despite it being used for lnd. However, this has caused issues around collocating an implementation of Lightning along with the specification of the protocol. To resolve this, Olaoluwa Osuntokun suggested moving the spec to an independent repo owned by the community, potentially using github.com/lightning/bolts or creating a new org like "lightning-specs." Another email thread discussed the possibility of moving a repository and addressing potential issues with broken links. Bryan Bishop suggested that broken links could be solved by including a soft note in a README somewhere. However, there were concerns that this may not be enough and that old links would need to be auto-redirected. The possibility of setting up a vote was also mentioned. It was noted that the Github "move repository" feature already includes auto-redirects for old links, but this information is a few years old and may no longer be accurate.In another email conversation, Martin Habovštiak confirmed that he had successfully moved a repository and all links continued to work properly. Despite the technical simplicity of repository moving, the issue at hand was not related to technology. Olaoluwa Osuntokun responded to a suggestion that LND's source code be removed from the lightningnetwork GitHub repository. He noted that LND was never referred to as the "reference" implementation and agreed that it might make sense for LND's source code to be moved to a separate repository. However, he also suggested that the Lightning specification be moved to an independent repository owned by the community for better organization and formalization of the stakeholders involved in the evolution of the Lightning protocol.</summary>
