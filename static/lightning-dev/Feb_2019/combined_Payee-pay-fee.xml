    <summary>In a discussion between Rusty and ZmnSCPxj, they explore the idea of a web way for clients to send invoices or offers over HTTPS. Rusty suggests that offers can work over Lightning Network (LN) alone and explains the process involved. ZmnSCPxj raises a concern about how the payee would know to give the BOLT12 offer to the payer, to which Rusty suggests that a node issuing a BOLT12 offer would implicitly signal its support for this feature. They both agree that it may be better to use a real message format instead of a fake payment. The intermediate nodes do not require upgrades as they remain unaware of this new feature. Using Single-Use-Receivable-BoLs (SURBs) can also be considered as an alternative solution.The email thread discusses the issue of fees in lightning network transactions where the payee pays the fee instead of the payer. ZmnSCPxj argues that the proper solution would involve the payee providing one or more complete paths from the payer to the payee node, which will be provided as fully encrypted onions to the payer, providing various benefits. These include the payee knowing exactly how much it will lose in fees since it is the one providing the path, improving privacy for the payer, and the payer being unable to bias the route towards other nodes it controls that happen to charge high LN fees. Rusty suggests that payees provide a fee limit along with an invoice and payers find a route that does not exceed the limit before paying the invoice.Cezary Dziemian has asked if there are any plans to offer a payment solution where the payee pays the fee instead of the payer. Rusty has suggested the creation of new URI schemes to facilitate the payment process for recurring payments. Currently, yalls.org requires users to produce an invoice which it will then pay, but the process is manual and messy. Rusty has proposed a mechanism for such "pull an invoice" requests, which was previously suggested by Takaya Imai at the summit. The proposal would also require a format for bolt11 offers to act as templates for the real invoice(s) to be fetched automatically.In essence, there is a need for some standard of transporting multiple encrypted onions from the user (payee) to the service (payer), and some implementation must provide some method of generating multiple routes from the user to the service. The implementation needs to have some heuristic, i.e. if it finds a route that loses more than 1% of the value being paid (overrideable by the user), then it probably should reject that route and not provide it to the service (payer). Rolling out a new feature that must be "sufficiently universal" is still plausible given the early stage.</summary>
