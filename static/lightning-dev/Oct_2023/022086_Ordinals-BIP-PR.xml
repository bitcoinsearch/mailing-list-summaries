    <summary>The email proposes the use of an automated system to assign BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) numbers, in order to save time and focus on more impactful tasks. Currently, dedicated BIP maintainers are responsible for assigning BIP numbers, but the methodology for this selection process is not published and appears to be arbitrary. This manual process has been criticized as a gatekeeping mechanism, with accusations of favoritism and delays in assigning numbers to certain PRs (Pull Requests). 

To address these issues, the suggestion is to remove the subjective human element from the process and switch to using PR numbers to assign BIPs. Under this proposed system, PRs would be assigned BIP numbers as soon as they are opened, eliminating the need to track down a BIP maintainer at the end of a review and iteration period. This would simplify and streamline the process, reducing unnecessary debates and gatekeeping.

One potential drawback of this approach is that it would result in a significant increase in the BIP number space. Currently, the next PR number is 1508, so adopting this policy would result in a non-contiguous numbering system. However, this is already the case to some extent, and it could be offset by starting the new numbering scheme at the highest manually assigned BIP number.

Additionally, there is the issue of related BIPs, such as the segwit series (BIPs 141, 142, 143, 144, and 145). The proposal suggests using a suffix scheme to indicate the lineage of these BIPs. For example, if BIP 141 was the first PR, BIP 142 could be declared as BIP 141.2 or BIP 141-2. Finding a workable scheme for such cases should not be overly difficult.

Overall, the email raises the idea of implementing an automated system for assigning BIP numbers, with the aim of eliminating subjectivity and favoritism in the process. This could potentially improve efficiency and reduce frustrations associated with BIP number assignment.</summary>
