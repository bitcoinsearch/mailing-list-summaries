    <summary>Schnorr signatures, which are 64 bytes in size, can be used in situations like lightning where the transaction form is deterministically derived. Signing 100 extra transactions would only require an additional 6400 bytes. Even with a slow connection speed of 100KB/s, this extra data can be transferred in just 64 milliseconds. In such cases, latency will still be the dominant factor.

RBF (Replace-By-Fee) has a default minimum incremental relay fee of 1sat/vByte. By using the 100 pre-signed transaction variants to sign every possible minimum incremental relay, a range of 1sat/vByte to 100sat/vByte can be covered. This range is believed to be sufficient for getting mined in any block throughout Bitcoin's modern history.

On the other hand, CPFP (Child-Pays-for-Parent) requires two transactions and thus additional bytes. Unless there are specific edge cases with very large transactions in low-fee environments, CPFP does not outperform RBF.
