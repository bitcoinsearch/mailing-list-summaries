    <summary>Schnorr signatures are 64 bytes in size, making them efficient for situations like lightning where deterministic transaction forms are used. Signing an additional 100 transactions would only require an extra 6400 bytes, which can be easily transferred even with a slow 100KB/s connection. The main factor affecting performance in this case would be latency.

Regarding Replace-By-Fee (RBF), it has a default minimum incremental relay fee of 1sat/vByte. By using the 100 pre-signed transaction variants, it is possible to cover a range of fees from 1sat/vByte to 100sat/vByte. This range should be sufficient for getting the transactions mined in any block throughout Bitcoin's modern history.

On the other hand, Child-Pays-for-Parent (CPFP) requires two transactions, resulting in additional bytes. While there may be rare cases involving large transactions in low-fee environments where CPFP could be advantageous, in general, RBF is more favorable.
