    <summary>Schnorr signatures, which are 64 bytes in size, can be beneficial in situations like lightning where the transaction form is deterministically derived. Signing 100 extra transactions using Schnorr signatures would only require an additional 6400 bytes of data. Even with a slow connection speed of 100KB/s, this extra data can be transferred in just 64ms, as latency is usually the main factor. 

In terms of transaction fees, Replace-by-Fee (RBF) has a default minimum incremental relay fee of 1 satoshi per virtual byte (vByte). By using 100 pre-signed transaction variants, one can cover a range of 1 sat/vByte to 100 sat/vByte, which should be sufficient for getting mined in any block throughout Bitcoin's modern history. 

On the other hand, Child-Pays-for-Parent (CPFP) requires two transactions and thus additional bytes. Unless there are specific edge cases involving very large transactions in low-fee environments, CPFP is not superior to RBF.
