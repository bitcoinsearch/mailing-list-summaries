    <summary>The email discusses the concept of replacement cycles in an attack and how they can be avoided by the attacker to reduce the cost of the attack. However, the defender can implement a scorched-earth fee bumping policy to counter this. The policy ensures that either the HTLC-timeout will confirm in the next block or the attacker must pay more fees than the HTLC-timeout fees to replace it. As the CLTV delta deadline approaches, the fees in the latter case may increase significantly, potentially reaching 50%, 80%, or even 100% of the HTLC value under such a policy.The email emphasizes that even if the attacker only needs to perform one replacement cycle right before the deadline, the attack can still be made unprofitable due to the high fees. In practice, as the deadline approaches, the attacker may need to perform multiple replacements. The email also mentions that the linear scorched earth policy described is just an illustration, and further tuning of the fee bumping curve across the full CLTV delta is necessary to ensure minimal fees are paid when not under attack.The author suggests becoming very aggressive as the deadline approaches, both to increase the chances of getting the transaction confirmed during high mempool congestion and to punish replacement-cycling attackers. The email does not provide any specific examples or links to further information.</summary>
