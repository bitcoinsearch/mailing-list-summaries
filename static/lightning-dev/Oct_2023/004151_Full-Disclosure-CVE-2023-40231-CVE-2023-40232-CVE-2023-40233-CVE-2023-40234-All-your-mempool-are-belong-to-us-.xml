    <summary>The email discusses the concept of replacement cycles in the context of an attack. It mentions that an attacker can avoid some replacement cycles to reduce the cost of the attack. However, the defender has implemented a scorched-earth fee bumping policy, which means that either the HTLC-timeout will confirm in the next block or the attacker must pay more fees than the HTLC-timeout fees to replace it.

As the CLTV delta deadline approaches, the fees in the second case may be 50%, 80%, or even 100% of the HTLC value under this scorched-earth policy. This means that even if the attacker only needs to do one replacement cycle right before the deadline, the attack can become unprofitable. In practice, with HTLC values significantly higher than the next-block fee cost, the attacker will need to perform multiple replacements as the deadline approaches.

It is important to note that the linear scorched-earth policy mentioned is just an illustration, and further tuning of the fee bumping curve across the full CLTV delta is necessary to ensure minimal fees are paid when not under attack. However, as the deadline approaches, it is suggested to become very aggressive both to confirm transactions during high mempool congestion and to punish replacement-cycling attackers.

Overall, the email highlights the importance of the scorched-earth fee bumping policy as a defense mechanism against attackers trying to exploit replacement cycles. By implementing this policy, the defender can make the attack unprofitable and discourage attackers from engaging in such activities.</summary>
