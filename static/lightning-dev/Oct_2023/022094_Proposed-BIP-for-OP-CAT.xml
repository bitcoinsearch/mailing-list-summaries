    <title>Proposed BIP for OP_CAT</title>
    <updated>2023-10-30T14:43:54.644555+00:00</updated>

    <summary>The email discusses the behavior of a programming concept called OP_CAT, which is used to concatenate two strings. The context mentions that if OP_CAT is immediately successful when the combined size of the strings is greater than or equal to 520 bytes, it will revert to the behavior of another concept called OP_SUCCESSx. It suggests that the maximum size can be increased in a subsequent soft fork.

The email also acknowledges that increasing the maximum size would often require additional opcodes to validate the size of non-constant arguments. However, it states that in many cases, only five or six bytes would be needed. 

The email includes a link to https://petertodd.org, which may provide further information on the topic. Additionally, there is an email address mentioned as 'peter'[:-1]@petertodd.org, although it's not clear how it relates to the discussion.

Overall, the email primarily focuses on the behavior and potential modifications of the OP_CAT programming concept. It briefly touches on the need for additional opcodes and provides a link for further reference.</summary>
