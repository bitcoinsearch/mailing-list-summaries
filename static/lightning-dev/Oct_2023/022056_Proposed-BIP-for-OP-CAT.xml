    <summary>In a recent email, the topic of discussion revolves around the maximum stack element size enforced by tapscript in the current age. The sender mentions that there seems to be no new limit related to tapscript. Initially, there was no limit, but a limit of 5k was implemented, and later reduced to 520 Bytes in the same commit where OP_CAT was disabled (commit: 4bd188c4383d6e614e18f79dc337fbabe8464c82).

The email does not provide any further information or context regarding the implications or reasons behind these limits. However, it highlights the specific changes made to the maximum stack element size over time.

It is important to note that the email does not contain any links or external references that could provide additional insights or details on this subject.

Overall, the email provides a brief overview of the evolution of the maximum stack element size in relation to tapscript, highlighting the initial lack of limit, followed by the implementation of a 5k limit, and ultimately reducing it to 520 Bytes during the same commit where OP_CAT was disabled.</summary>
