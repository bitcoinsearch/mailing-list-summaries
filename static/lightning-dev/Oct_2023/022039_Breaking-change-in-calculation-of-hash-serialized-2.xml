    <summary>In a recent discussion, James raised an interesting question regarding the use of the sha256 hash of the snapshot file as the canonical hash. He suggested that this would eliminate any potential malleability issues. Currently, the gettxoutsetinfo function is used to calculate the hash by walking through the entire UTXO set. James proposed a more straightforward approach, where the function would generate the contents of the dump file and calculate its hash directly.

This idea presents a practical solution that could simplify the implementation process. By using the actual contents of the dump file itself, the hash calculation becomes more direct and eliminates potential vulnerabilities. James's suggestion aligns with the notion of making the code more efficient and secure.
