    <summary>Bitcoin Core version v25.1 is now available for download. This release includes bug fixes, performance improvements, and updated translations. To report bugs, please use the issue tracker on GitHub. To receive security and update notifications, subscribe to the mailing list.

To upgrade to the latest version, shut down the older version and wait until it has completely shut down. Then, run the installer on Windows or copy over the application file on macOS/Linux. If you are upgrading from an older version that has reached its end of life, it may take some time to migrate the data directory. Old wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.

Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on Linux, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer. While it should work on other Unix-like systems, it is not as frequently tested on them. It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems.

Some notable changes in this release include parallel compact block downloads, improved fee estimation, fixed handling of invalid bech32 addresses, bug fixes in the wallet address book migration, descriptors, and script migration. There are also various build-related fixes and improvements, as well as fixes in the GUI and miscellaneous areas.

The release notes also mention credits to individuals who directly contributed to this release, including Abubakar Sadiq Ismail, Andrew Chow, Bruno Garcia, Gregory Sanders, Hennadii Stepanov, MacroFake, Matias Furszyfer, Michael Ford, Pieter Wuille, stickies-v, and Will Clark. Additionally, thanks are given to those who helped with translations.
