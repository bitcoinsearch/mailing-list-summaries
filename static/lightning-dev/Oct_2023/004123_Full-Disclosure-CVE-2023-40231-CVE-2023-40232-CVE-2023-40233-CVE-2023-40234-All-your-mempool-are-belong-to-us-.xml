    <summary>In the email, the sender expresses gratitude to Antoine for their write-up and diligence in reporting an issue to various implementations. They also mention the collaboration on mitigations and attack scenarios. There is a clarification that all relevant mitigations were implemented in lnd v0.16.1-beta, which was released on April 24th, 2023 [1]. However, there have been some performance regressions due to these mitigations, specifically related to mempool watching. To address this, in version 0.17.1, they plan to use the new `gettxspendingprevout` RPC call with bitcoind to further reduce load.
