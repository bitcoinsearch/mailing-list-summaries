    <summary>The email begins with the sender expressing gratitude to Antoine for a well-written report and for diligently addressing the reported issue with various implementations. The sender then clarifies that all relevant mitigations were implemented in lnd v0.16.1-beta, which was released on April 24th, 2023 [1]. However, there have been some performance regressions due to certain mitigations, specifically related to mempool watching. To address this, in version 0.17.1, they plan to utilize the new `gettxspendingprevout` RPC call with bitcoind to further reduce the load.[1] - Link to lnd v0.16.1-beta release: &lt;insert link here&gt;</summary>
