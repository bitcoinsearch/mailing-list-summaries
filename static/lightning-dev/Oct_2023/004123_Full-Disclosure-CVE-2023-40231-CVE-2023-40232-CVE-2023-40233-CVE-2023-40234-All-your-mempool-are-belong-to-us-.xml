    <summary>The email begins with the sender expressing gratitude to Antoine for a well-written article and for diligently reporting an issue to different implementations. The sender also appreciates Antoine's efforts in collaborating on mitigations and discussing attack scenarios. However, the sender clarifies that all relevant mitigations for lnd were already implemented in version 0.16.1-beta, which was released on April 24th, 2023 [1]. Since then, the team has addressed performance regressions caused by some of the mitigations related to mempool watching. In the upcoming version 0.17.1, they plan to further reduce the load by utilizing the new `gettxspendingprevout` RPC call with bitcoind.
