    <summary>The email discusses a paper on mitigation techniques related to defensive fee-rebroadcasting. The paper can be found at the link provided. The sender mentions that when there is a backlog in the mempool and the defensive fractional fee HTLC-timeout remains stuck, it gives an advantage to the attacker. Additionally, the sender speculates that an attacker could replace-cycle multiple honest HTLC-timeouts with a single malicious HTLC-preimage, paying the absolute fee while only incurring the RBF penalty. Although the sender hasn't tested this specific behavior, they note that the "fees" math doesn't appear to favor the defenders.</summary>
