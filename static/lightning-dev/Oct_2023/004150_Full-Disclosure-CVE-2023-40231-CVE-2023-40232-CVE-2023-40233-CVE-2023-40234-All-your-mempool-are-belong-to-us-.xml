    <summary>Antoine mentions that the attached paper discusses a mitigation called defensive fee-rebroadcasting in subsection 3.4. He provides a link to the paper (https://github.com/ariard/mempool-research/blob/2023-10-replacement-paper/replacement-cycling.pdf). Antoine points out that when there is a mempool backlog and the defensive fractional fee HTLC-timeout gets stuck, it gives an advantage to the attacker. He further explains that an attacker can replace-cycle multiple honest HTLC-timeouts with a single malicious HTLC-preimage by paying the absolute fee and only incurring the RBF penalty. Although Antoine hasn't tested this specific behavior, he observes that the fee calculations don't seem to favor the defenders.</summary>
