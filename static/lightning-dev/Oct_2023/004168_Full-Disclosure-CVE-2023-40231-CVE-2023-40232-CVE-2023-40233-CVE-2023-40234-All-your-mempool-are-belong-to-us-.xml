    <summary>In an email sent by Peter Todd on 10/20/23 at 9:25 PM, he discusses the issue of storing a large amount of data for Lightning. He explains that currently, Lightning doesn't generate a significant amount of data, but when multiplied by 100, it becomes necessary to store a substantial amount of data for larger nodes. Dealing with this increased data storage becomes a much bigger challenge compared to dealing with smaller amounts of data.

Peter mentions that the use of SIGHASH_SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY allows for combining multiple HTLC (Hashed Time-Lock Contract) claims into one transaction. This is in contrast to pre-signing, which results in a large number of individual transactions. The ability to combine these claims into a single transaction offers a more efficient and streamlined approach.

Overall, Peter highlights the importance of addressing the storage and management challenges associated with larger amounts of data in the context of Lightning. By using certain techniques like combining HTLC claims into one transaction, developers can mitigate the complexities involved in handling a higher volume of data.</summary>
