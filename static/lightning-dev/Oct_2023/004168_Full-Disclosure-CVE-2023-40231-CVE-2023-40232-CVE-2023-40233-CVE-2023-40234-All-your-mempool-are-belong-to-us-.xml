    <summary>In an email sent by Peter Todd, he discusses the issue of Lightning and the increasing amount of data that needs to be stored for larger nodes. He mentions that while Lightning data currently isn't significant, when multiplied by 100, it becomes a substantial amount of data. This leads to the need for storing a material amount of data, which can become a bigger challenge compared to dealing with smaller amounts like a GiB or twenty.

Peter also brings up the idea of combining multiple HTLC (Hashed Timelock Contracts) claims into one transaction using the SIGHASH_SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY technique. He highlights the advantage of this approach, as opposed to pre-signing individual transactions, which can result in a large number of separate transactions.

The email excerpt ends abruptly after mentioning Peter's name, leaving the rest of the content unknown.</summary>
