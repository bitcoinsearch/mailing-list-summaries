    <summary>The email discusses the importance of ensuring that all splice implementations follow a certain protocol to avoid risks. It emphasizes the need for batched splicing to be consistent across implementations. The author suggests that as long as an implementation decides to splice again when a prior splice doesn't confirm, any issues will be resolved once a subsequent splice is confirmed. The email also includes a farewell message from Greg.</summary>
