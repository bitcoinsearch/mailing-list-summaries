    <summary>The email discusses the topic of disaggregating participant's pubkeys and balances from a partial subset push on the stack, and verifying the validity of corresponding signatures. It mentions that one requirement for a cut-through update of taproot leaves is to verify the authentication of the fan-out balances and pubkeys towards the "online" partition. However, it is stated that this subset is not known at pool setup. The email suggests that the proposed design of the coinpool and its cut-through mechanism could potentially utilize the OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY feature. Additionally, the email mentions the challenge of efficiently traversing, inspecting, and modifying the contract. The sender signs off as Antoine.</summary>
