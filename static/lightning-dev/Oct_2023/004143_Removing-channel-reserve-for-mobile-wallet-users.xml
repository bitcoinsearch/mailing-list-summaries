    <summary>In a recent email, John Carvalho, the CEO of Synonym.to, discusses the removal of the reserve for users in Bitkit. He mentions that the reserve has been reduced to the dust limit because it currently does not function properly without it. However, upon gaining more knowledge about the reserve and its purpose, Carvalho realizes that the design is nonsensical.Carvalho expresses his full support for Bastien's suggestion of implementing more practical and user-friendly approaches instead of relying on the reserve balance. He highlights that the reserve balance leads to customer support issues and creates a confusing user experience. Carvalho further points out that Lightning, the platform they are working on, already has enough complications, and adding to that with the reserve balance is unnecessary.By removing the reserve for users in Bitkit, Carvalho acknowledges that there may be challenges and potential drawbacks. However, he emphasizes the importance of prioritizing practicality and user-friendliness in order to improve customer support and overall user experience.</summary>
