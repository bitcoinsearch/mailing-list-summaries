    <summary>Antoine is expressing uncertainty about the robustness of secure fee-bumping, even with future mechanisms like package relay and nversion=3, for multi-party transactions and covenant-enable constructions under usual risk models. Antoine provides a link to a test on GitHub for reference. Antoine is seeking the input of experts who understand both lightning and core mempool on this matter. There has been a lot of discussion regarding the design rules of nversion=3, and the test is typically based on the glozow top commit of October 3, 2023. Antoine concludes the email with a farewell.</summary>
