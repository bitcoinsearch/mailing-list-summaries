    <summary>In an email dated October 24, 2023, Olaoluwa Osuntokun expresses skepticism towards a proposed solution that appears to be unnecessary. The author believes that this solution is searching for a problem that doesn't actually exist. Additionally, the author criticizes the effectiveness of this solution, suggesting that it might be better not to assign BIP numbers at all if they are not going to be useful. According to the author, the current system is functioning well, despite occasional disruptions caused by trolls or malicious individuals.</summary>
