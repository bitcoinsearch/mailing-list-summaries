    <summary>The email discusses the concept of increasing the multiplier in fee bumping. The sender clarifies that increasing the multiplier means starting with a smaller multiplier at the beginning of the range and ending with a bigger one. They provide an example of fee increases pre-signed with multipliers such as 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.8, 2.6, 4.2, 7.4, etc. This approach allows for using a larger percentage of the range for smaller bumps and reserving larger percentage bumps for the end when the strategy changes to something more "scorched-earth." The idea is to apply this concept properly to commitment transactions so that replacements may have HTLCs (Hashed Time Lock Contracts) removed when their value drops below the necessary fees for mining. The sender notes that simultaneous variants of transactions can be signed where the fees are deducted from different parties' outputs. For example, Alice can give Bob the ability to broadcast higher and higher fee transactions, taking the fees from Bob's output(s), and Bob can give Alice the same ability, taking the fees from Alice's output(s). The sender mentions that they haven't fully considered how this would work with musig but suggest it can be done with plain old OP_CheckMultisig.For more information on the topic, the email includes a link to petertodd.org followed by the email address 'peter'[:-1]@petertodd.org.</summary>
