    <summary>The email discusses the concept of increasing the multiplier in a specific context. The sender clarifies that by "increasing the multiplier", they mean starting with a smaller multiplier at the beginning of the range and ending with a bigger one. They provide an example of fee-bumping with pre-signed fee increases: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.8, 2.6, 4.2, 7.4, etc. This approach allows for utilizing most of the range for smaller fee increases as a percentage, while reserving larger percentage increases for the end where the strategy changes to something more aggressive.

The idea is applied to commitment transactions, and it is mentioned that when the value of the replacements drops below the necessary fees, HTLCs (Hashed Time-Locked Contracts) may be removed from the transactions. Additionally, it is noted that simultaneous variants of transactions can be signed, deducting fees from different parties' outputs. For example, Alice can give Bob the ability to broadcast higher fee transactions, taking the fees from Bob's output(s), and vice versa.

The sender acknowledges that they haven't fully considered how this would work with musig, but they mention that it can be done with OP_CheckMultisig. They provide a link to Peter Todd's website (https://petertodd.org) and mention their email address (peter@petertodd.org).</summary>
