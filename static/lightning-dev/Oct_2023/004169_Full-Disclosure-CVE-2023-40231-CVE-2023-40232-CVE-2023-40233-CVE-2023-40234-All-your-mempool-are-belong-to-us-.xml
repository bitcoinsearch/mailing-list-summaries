    <summary>The email discusses the topic of storing ephemeral data, specifically in relation to HTLC (Hashed Timelock Contracts) transactions and commitment transactions. The sender mentions that lightning uses disclosed secrets to invalidate old state, which means there is no need to keep every signature from the counterparty indefinitely.

To calculate the storage requirements per channel, the sender refers to some numbers but does not provide specific details in the email. Additionally, they mention that RBF (Replace-By-Fee) has a minimum incremental relay fee of 1sat/vByte by default. It is unclear how this relates to the storage of ephemeral data.

The sender also mentions that combining multiple SIGHASH_SINGLE transactions together does not result in significant savings. They explain that this is because SIGHASH_SINGLE requires one output per input, and the savings only amount to 18 bytes for nVersion, nLockTime, and the txin and txout size fields. In contrast, the HTLC-timeout transaction is 166.5 vBytes, resulting in a savings of just 11%.

The email suggests that if there is a need to fee bump and add an additional input, it takes up space and may require a change output. In such cases, the sender states that using a pre-signed transaction would likely have been a better option.

The sender also makes an assumption that there are many HTLCs in flight that need to be spent. However, they mention that this is often not the case without providing further explanation or context. 

The email concludes with a link to Peter Todd's website (https://petertodd.org) and an email address (peter@petertodd.org).</summary>
