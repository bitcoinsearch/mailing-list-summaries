    <summary>The email discusses the topic of storing ephemeral data, specifically focusing on HTLC (Hashed Time-Lock Contract) transactions and commitment transactions. The sender mentions that in the Lightning Network, disclosed secrets are used to invalidate old state, so it is not necessary to keep every signature from the counterparty indefinitely.

The sender also provides some numbers regarding the storage requirements for these transactions. They mention that with the given numbers, one would need more than the default minimum incremental relay fee of 1sat/vByte set by RBF (Replace-By-Fee). Additionally, the savings obtained by combining multiple SIGHASH_SINGLE transactions together are not significant, as it only reduces the size by 18 bytes.

In terms of HTLC-timeout transactions, the sender states that they have a size of 166.5 vBytes, resulting in a savings of just 11% compared to individual transactions. However, if there is a need to fee bump and add an additional input, the space taken up by that input and the requirement for a change output may make a pre-signed transaction a better option.

The sender also mentions that the assumption of having numerous HTLCs in flight that need to be spent is often not the case. In conclusion, the email provides insights into the storage considerations and potential optimizations related to storing ephemeral data in HTLC and commitment transactions.
