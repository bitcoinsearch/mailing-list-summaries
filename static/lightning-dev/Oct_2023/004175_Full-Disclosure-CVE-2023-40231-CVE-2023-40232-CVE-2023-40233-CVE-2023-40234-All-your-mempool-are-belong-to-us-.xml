    <summary>In an email sent by Peter Todd, he acknowledges a fair point made about the limited impact of a particular issue on the Lightning Network. He mentions that while the issue is not significant in the grand scheme of things, it is still noteworthy considering the inherent nature of chain-spam. He further explains that in cases where force-close occurs, there tends to be a recurring failure in multiple HTLCs.

However, Peter believes that the focus should not solely be on fixing this issue within the Lightning Network's trust model. He argues that it is already possible for peers willing to invest effort to steal money, and the additional threat introduced by this issue is just one more way they can do so. Instead of rushing to fix the Lightning Network, Peter suggests addressing the problem at the ecosystem level, ensuring that policy restrictions do not negatively impact the L2 network and reduce miners' earnings. He refers to such a scenario as a policy bug.

The email does not provide any links or additional context that could be used in the summary. The farewell part of the email is also excluded from the summary.</summary>
