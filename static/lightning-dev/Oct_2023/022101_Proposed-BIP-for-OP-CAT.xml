    <summary>The email suggests that the sender has made a set of three patches available for use in the inquisition project. These patches can be accessed on GitHub at the following link: https://github.com/ajtowns/bitcoin/commits/202310-inq25-cat. However, the sender notes that the tests associated with these patches need to be updated and added.

The sender also mentions that it may be beneficial to compare these commits with similar ones from the APO/CTV PRs. These can be found at the following links: https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/pull/33 and https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/pull/34.

Additionally, the sender suggests the possibility of adding support for CSFS (presumably a specific feature or functionality) instead of having it as separate script-verify flags and deployments. The sender ends the email with a playful remark about a "harmful cat."

In summary, the email provides information about the availability of patches for the inquisition project, the need to update and add tests for these patches, and the suggestion of comparing them with previous commits. The sender also proposes the idea of incorporating CSFS support.</summary>
