    <summary>The email discusses a vulnerability in the lightning network that allows for an attack on pre-anchor channels. However, with anchor channels, the attack can be performed by either side of the closure. The issue stems from the fact that the HTLCs are now only signed SIGHASH_SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY, limiting the ability to add more inputs and perform the attack as the broadcaster. The author mentions that fixing this issue on the lightning end is not the right approach, as it is ultimately a problem with the transaction broadcast ordering by miners.

The author suggests that the fix should lie with Bitcoin Core or other parts of the mining stack. However, fixing this in the Bitcoin Core stack would require unbounded memory, which is not feasible. Instead, the author proposes the idea of an external piece of software that monitors the mempool for transactions that were replaced out but could potentially re-enter the mempool later with other replacements. This software could optimize the revenue of block template selection while inadvertently fixing the vulnerability.

Overall, the email highlights the need for addressing the vulnerability in the lightning network and suggests potential solutions involving Bitcoin Core and external software monitoring the mempool.</summary>
