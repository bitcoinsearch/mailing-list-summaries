    <summary>The email discusses a potential attack on anchor channels in the context of lightning counterparty engineering a transaction broadcast ordering. The attack can be performed by either side of the closure, as the HTLCs are now signed SIGHASH_SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY, allowing for additional inputs and the attack to be carried out even by the broadcaster. The author mentions that fixing this issue on the lightning end is not the right approach and suggests that the fix should ultimately lie with Bitcoin Core or other parts of the mining stack.

However, fixing this in the Bitcoin Core stack is not a trivial task due to the need for unbounded memory to keep enough history to address the issue. The author proposes the idea of a simple external software that monitors the mempool for transactions which were replaced out but may re-enter the mempool later with other replacements and stores them on disk. This software could optimize the revenue of block template selection while inadvertently fixing the issue.

It is acknowledged that fixing this particular issue would require significant changes and highlights that the current fix for anchor channels also addresses other usability issues and important edge cases. The author concludes by stating that it may not be viable to walk back the change made to fix this issue, considering its broader implications.</summary>
