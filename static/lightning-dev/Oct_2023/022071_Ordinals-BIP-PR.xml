    <summary>The email discusses the evaluation of BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) and expresses a disagreement with evaluating them based on their implementation rather than their specification or their consequences for the network. The sender believes that this approach sets a bad precedent and accomplishes little beyond making the BIPs repository difficult to interact with. They argue that actual consensus is much bigger than the BIPs repo itself. Additionally, there is concern that interpreting BIP numbers as indicating that proposals are "blessed" by a particular influential set of people can lead to problems. The email is signed by Andrew Poelstra, Director of Research at Blockstream. The email includes contact information for Andrew Poelstra and a quote from Justin Lewis-Webster stating that "the sun is always shining in space."</summary>
