    <summary>In this email exchange, Bastien raises the concern about Lightning Service Providers (LSPs) not having a reserve, which makes it easier for them to steal funds. He mentions that there are no reliable watch tower integrations/products available to mitigate this issue. Bastien also questions how users can publish a previous commitment and suggests solving this problem and exposing it to users.Tony responds by acknowledging Bastien's concern and mentioning that in Phoenix (their wallet), they allow the wallet user to have no reserve but require the LSP to meet the usual reserve requirements. Tony seeks clarification from Bastien on what he means by the "dust reserve limit."In his initial email, Bastien discusses the channel reserve requirement and argues that it should be removed for channels between mobile wallet users and their service providers. He explains that the channel reserve ensures that both peers always have an output in the commit transaction, which discourages malicious behavior. However, he highlights the drawbacks of having a channel reserve, including capital inefficiency and a poor user experience. Bastien suggests that removing the reserve on both sides is acceptable because the service provider pays the on-chain fees for the commit transaction and loses something when publishing a revoked commit. For the wallet user, they still get their funds back using penalty transactions. Bastien also notes that the wallet user can publicly show that the service provider published a revoked commitment, which negatively impacts their reputation. Removing the reserve on the wallet user's side is seen as a risk for the wallet provider to ensure a good user experience. Additionally, Bastien draws parallels between LN-penalty without channel reserves and LN-symmetry (Eltoo). He argues that if cheating nodes can always publish a previous commitment in Eltoo with minimal penalties, then it should be acceptable in the current context as well.</summary>
