    <summary>In the email exchange, Bastien raises the issue of Lightning Service Providers (LSPs) not having a reserve, which makes it easier for them to steal from offline mobile users. He mentions that there should be reliable watch tower integrations to mitigate this problem. The question is raised on whether a user can publish a previous commitment and if this is something that needs to be solved for and exposed to users. A link to the dust reserves that still apply is provided.The sender explains how a wallet user can prove certain actions and information related to their wallet provider, specifically in the case of an old state being broadcasted. Four points are outlined that can be proven by the user: 1. A revocation happened, 2. The user was one of the participants, 3. The wallet provider (nodeid) was the other participant, and 4. Identifying the cheating counterparty. The sender highlights the key insight in point 3/b, where the private channel_update can be shown.Bastien discusses the current state of wallets in Phoenix and proposes removing the reserve requirements for LSPs. He argues that the requirement for LSPs to have a reserve should also be removed without compromising trust. He believes that the channel reserve is necessary between routing nodes but not between wallet users and their LSPs. The email ends with a question asking Tony to clarify what he means by the "dust reserve limit."Tony acknowledges Bastien's message and raises questions and clarifications regarding the proposed user experience for wallets and LSPs. He asks if the proposal suggests a network-wide switch away from reserves or only applies to certain types of wallets and LSPs. Tony also seeks clarification on the dust reserve limit and whether all node implementations currently allow for the removal of the 1% reserve requirement while still maintaining the dust reserve.The email discusses the idea of getting rid of the channel reserve requirement for channels between mobile wallet users and their service providers. The author argues that it is acceptable to remove the channel reserve on both sides in this specific setting. The service provider pays the on-chain fees for the commit transaction, even without an output in the transaction. The wallet user can still get their funds back using penalty transactions. The email highlights the benefits of removing the reserve and addresses potential concerns.Overall, the email exchange covers the concern of LSPs not having a reserve, discusses how a wallet user can prove actions and information related to their wallet provider, proposes removing the reserve requirements for LSPs, and explores the idea of removing the channel reserve requirement for channels between mobile wallet users and their service providers.</summary>
