    <summary>In this email, the sender informs the recipient, Gleb Naumenko, about their plan to allocate research time towards finding a sustainable fix for the Lightning Network. They express their intention to address various issues, including pinnings, replacement cycling attacks, mempool issues, and force-closure beyond available blockspace. The sender mentions that they have been studying these cross-layer issues together since 2019/2020 and have gained practical experience in bitcoin core and rust-lightning codebases, as well as conducted significant research in this area.

The sender also mentions that they would like to involve Gleb in the research, assuming he is not too busy with Erlay in core. They express confidence that Gleb will be enthusiastic to contribute research time at his own pace. Additionally, the sender considers seeking assistance from Elichai Turkel to verify the mathematics of the proposed lightning fixes and risk models.

The sender emphasizes that all commitments and progress depend on the interest and support of the bitcoin community. They mention that implementing long-term sustainable fixes could potentially reduce the fee-bumping reserve value and the number of locked UTXOs for lightning users. They provide a link to an issue they reopened on coordinated security issues handling in the LN ecosystem.

While the sender intends to focus on solving the identified problems at the base-layer, they also express their commitment to stay involved in the Lightning Network development for a few months to facilitate the transition with younger LN developers. However, they clarify that they do not have any concrete solutions, drafts, or code ready at this point. They acknowledge the need for careful consideration of game theory, node network processing resources, and adherence to the open and responsible Bitcoin process.

The sender acknowledges that this endeavor will take reasonable time, citing the ongoing package relay design discussions that started in 2018 and are now progressing to the hard implementation and review phase. They invite thoughts and input from the Bitcoin and Lightning development protocols community to contribute to this research effort.

In conclusion, the email highlights the sender's and Gleb's plan to dedicate research time to finding a sustainable fix for the Lightning Network. They discuss their expertise in the field, potential collaboration with Elichai Turkel, the importance of community support, and the need for careful consideration in solving the identified issues.</summary>
