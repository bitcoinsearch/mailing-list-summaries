    <summary>In the email, the sender expresses uncertainty about whether a certain problem has been resolved. They mention that while many nodes may already be implementing a solution, they question whether it can be considered fixed if the victim of the problem still has to spend significantly more than the prevailing mempool fees. Additionally, they highlight the potential issue of burning a large percentage of the HTLC value. The sender's tone appears to be lighthearted and humorous, as indicated by the use of a smiley face at the end of their statement.</summary>
