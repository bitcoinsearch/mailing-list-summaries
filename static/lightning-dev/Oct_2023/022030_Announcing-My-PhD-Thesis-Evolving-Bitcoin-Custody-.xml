    <summary>Jacob GÃ¶ker Swambo has shared his PhD thesis titled "Evolving Bitcoin Custody" with the Bitcoin community. The thesis focuses on the design and analysis of Bitcoin custody systems, exploring their evolution in response to technological advancements and threats. The full thesis can be accessed on ArXiv using the link provided.

In his research, Jacob pays particular attention to deleted-key covenants and advocates for a comprehensive approach to other covenant proposals requiring soft-forks. He emphasizes the importance of systematic specifications and meticulous analysis to identify and rectify potential pitfalls, ensuring user safety. One key concern he highlights is coin-control challenges and the subsequent impact on user experience. To address this, he suggests the adoption of more granular covenants, such as the INSPECT_X implemented in the Liquid sidechain.

Jacob also introduces the Ajolote custody system as a theoretical case study. Although he doesn't expect it to be built, he presents it as a conceptual framework for further discussions and developments in the field. While acknowledging that Ajolote may be too complicated for users, he believes it offers valuable insights into the ongoing debate on bitcoin covenants and vaults.

The thesis provides a methodology for security analysis that can be of significant value to custody system designers. This approach not only addresses the challenges faced by custody systems but also offers a structured framework for evaluating and enhancing their security. Jacob encourages designers to explore and potentially integrate this attack model and methodology into their respective systems' security analysis. He is open to discussions and collaborations in this domain.

Overall, Jacob's thesis offers a deep-dive into Bitcoin custody systems, providing insights into their evolution and addressing various challenges. It serves as a valuable resource for those interested in the design and enhancement of custody systems.</summary>
