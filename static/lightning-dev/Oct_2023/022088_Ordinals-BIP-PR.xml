    <summary>In a recent email, Christopher Allen suggests a modification to the idea at hand. He proposes that the numbers should include both the year and the number in the year. This practice is already followed for research and "wallet improvement proposals" at Blockchain Commons. By including the year and number, it prevents the numbers from becoming excessively large like EIPs currently are. Additionally, Christopher suggests that these numbers should only be automatically offered if a maintainer does not reject it within three days. This approach allows maintainers to focus on responding to obvious spam, and if a proposal is rejected, the moderator's name would be attached to it instead of the current anonymous pocket veto.</summary>
