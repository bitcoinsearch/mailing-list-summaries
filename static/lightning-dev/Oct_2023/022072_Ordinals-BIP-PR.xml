    <summary>The email discusses the topic of requesting a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) for OpenTimestamps, which is considered to be of wider relevance to Bitcoin users than Ordinals. However, the sender states that they have not requested a BIP for OpenTimestamps because they believe that not every protocol that uses Bitcoin needs to be documented with a BIP. They express their opinion that there have been too many BIPs for various things and suggest that BIP assignment should be limited to widely adopted standards used by the entire Bitcoin community for the core mission of Bitcoin.

The sender also mentions that Lightning, another protocol related to Bitcoin, is not standardized through the BIP process. They view this as a positive aspect and explain that Lightning does not require the approval of Core maintainers. Instead, Lightning has its own separate BOLT process, which signifies its independence from the BIP process.

Overall, the sender's perspective is that BIP assignment and acceptance should be reserved for protocols that have significant widespread use and are crucial to the core mission of Bitcoin. They believe that using separate processes, like the BOLT process for Lightning, can provide clarity and avoid unnecessary BIP assignments.
