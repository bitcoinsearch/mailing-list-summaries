    <summary>The email discusses the possibility of enabling OP_CAT on Bitcoin and the preference for using OP_SUCCESS126 instead of OP_SUCCESS80. The sender expresses their willingness to switch to OP_SUCCESS126 if there is sufficient interest and a strong desire in the community. They mention that they don't have any particular affinity for OP_SUCCESS80 and ask if anyone objects to using OP_SUCCESS126.

It seems that the sender is open to considering the use of OP_SUCCESS126 based on the community's interest and preference. They are seeking input from others regarding the choice between OP_SUCCESS126 and OP_SUCCESS80.</summary>
