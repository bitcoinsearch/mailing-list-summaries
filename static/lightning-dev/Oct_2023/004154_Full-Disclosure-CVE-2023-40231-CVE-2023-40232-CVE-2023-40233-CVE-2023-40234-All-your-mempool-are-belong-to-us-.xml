    <summary>After replying to a mail on the economics of sequential malicious replacement of honest HTLC-timeout, the sender conducted a test to verify the behavior on the core mempool. The test yielded expected results and the details can be found in this repository: https://github.com/ariard/bitcoin/commit/30f5d5b270e4ff195e8dcb9ef6b7ddcc5f6a1bf2. The process of responsible disclosure followed the guidelines set for hardware issues affecting operating systems, as documented for the Linux kernel. This adaptation to the bitcoin ecosystem can be explored further here: https://docs.kernel.org/6.1/process/embargoed-hardware-issues.html.

Effective immediately, the sender has decided to halt their involvement with the development of the lightning network and its implementations. This includes coordinating the handling of security issues at the protocol level. Prior to this decision, the sender informed some senior lightning developers about their intentions. Additionally, the sender closed an old issue related to this matter on the bolt repository, which can be seen here: https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/772.

The sender believes that the new class of replacement cycling attacks poses a significant risk to the lightning network. They argue that a sustainable fix can only be achieved at the base-layer, such as adding a memory-intensive history of all-seen transactions or implementing a consensus upgrade. While deployed mitigations may offer some protection against simple attacks, the sender doubts their effectiveness against advanced attackers, as mentioned in the initial full disclosure mail. They emphasize that changes of this nature require transparency and buy-in from the community, as they impact the processing requirements of full-nodes and the security architecture of the decentralized bitcoin ecosystem as a whole.

However, fully explaining the reasons behind these changes and designing them effectively would necessitate revealing practical and critical attacks on a ~5 355 public BTC ecosystem. This presents a challenging dilemma. The sender highlights the importance of getting these changes right on the first attempt, as there may not be a second chance to fix them once deployed. Until the week of October 30th, the sender will refrain from discussing these issues on public mailing lists. Sufficient material has already been published on the topic, and other experts are available for further discussion. Afterward, the sender plans to shift their focus back to Bitcoin Core.

In conclusion, the sender provides a brief farewell and signs off as Antoine.</summary>
