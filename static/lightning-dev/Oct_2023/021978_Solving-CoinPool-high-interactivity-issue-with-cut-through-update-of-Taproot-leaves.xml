    <summary>Johan suggests that the OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY feature may be able to fulfill Antoine's requirements. He provides a link (https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-May/021719.html) for further reference. Johan explains that by storing the participants' public keys and balances in the dynamic data instead of the taptree, it is possible to have a subset of online users combine their balances in a new output, while the offline users' funds remain inaccessible in a separate output. This can be achieved by spending the coinpool utxo with a transaction consisting of two outputs: one being the remainder of the previous coinpool for the offline users, and the second being the new coinpool for the online users. If an offline user comes back online and attempts to double spend the UTXO, Eltoo can be used as a solution.</summary>
