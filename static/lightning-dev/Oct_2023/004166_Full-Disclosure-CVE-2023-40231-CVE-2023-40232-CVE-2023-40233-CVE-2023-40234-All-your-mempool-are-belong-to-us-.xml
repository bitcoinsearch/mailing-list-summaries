    <summary>Peter Todd discusses the use of anchor outputs in his email. He mentions that removing the pre-set feerate has resolved several issues with edge-cases and helped address the fee-inflation attack. Now, by allowing the broadcaster to choose which transaction they broadcast, using pre-signed transactions does not reintroduce those issues. However, Todd expresses skepticism about using multiple pre-signed transactions. He highlights two concerns: (a) it would increase fee overhead, and (b) it would require significant effort to keep track of numerous variants across different feerates, potentially resulting in overspending on fees. Todd believes that this is a policy bug that needs to be fixed at the policy/Bitcoin Core layer, rather than in the lightning world. He acknowledges that fixing it in the policy domain may be resource-intensive, but he still considers it essential. 

Overall, Todd's email emphasizes the importance of addressing the issues related to pre-signed transactions and anchor outputs within the broader context of Bitcoin Core's policy layer.</summary>
