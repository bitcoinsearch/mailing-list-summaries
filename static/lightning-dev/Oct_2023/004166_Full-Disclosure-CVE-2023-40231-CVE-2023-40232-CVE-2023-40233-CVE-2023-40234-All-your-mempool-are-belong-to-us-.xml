    <summary>In an email sent by Peter Todd, he discusses the use of anchor outputs and how they address issues with edge-cases and the fee-inflation attack. By removing the pre-set feerate, the broadcaster has the ability to choose which transactions to broadcast. However, Todd expresses skepticism towards using multiple pre-signed transactions. He mentions that it would result in more fee overhead and be cumbersome to keep track of all the variants across different feerates. Additionally, this transaction pattern could potentially result in miners not receiving optimal value in transaction fees. Todd believes that this issue should be addressed at the policy/Bitcoin Core layer rather than in the lightning world.
