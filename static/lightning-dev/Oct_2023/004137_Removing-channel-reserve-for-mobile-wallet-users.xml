    <summary>In the email, Tony Giorgio acknowledges Bastien's previous message but raises some questions and clarifications regarding the proposed user experience (UX) for wallets and Lightning Service Providers (LSPs). Tony asks if the proposal suggests a network-wide switch away from reserves or only applies to mobile wallets and LSPs that choose to opt in. Additionally, he inquires about the dust reserve limit.Tony notes that wallets and LSPs already offer the option to provide this UX and have been doing so for years. He seeks clarification on whether the proposal aims to replace reserves entirely or if it is specific to certain types of wallets and LSPs.Moreover, Tony mentions the dust reserve limit and expresses his understanding that all node implementations currently allow for the removal of the 1% reserve requirement while still maintaining the dust reserve. However, he seeks further information or clarification on this matter.The email concludes with Tony's name and the message being forwarded.</summary>
