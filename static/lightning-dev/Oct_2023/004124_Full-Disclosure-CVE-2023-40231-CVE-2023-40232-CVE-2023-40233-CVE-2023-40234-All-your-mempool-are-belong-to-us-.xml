    <summary>In the email, the sender is responding to Antoine's detailed explanation of pinning attacks in the context of Lightning Network. They express their concern about the likelihood of such attacks, especially if the attacker targets channels with high capacity and loose channel policies.

The sender then requests more details about the attack observed on the mainnet and asks for information on how to monitor the chain for suspicious behavior. They specifically inquire about any available tools that can be run in parallel to their Lightning software to track these attacks.

Additionally, the sender mentions that it is not necessary to control two neighboring nodes to target a victim. They explain that by cycling the attack on the tail side and delaying the confirmation of the htlc-timeout covenant, the peer at the front (incoming link) of the victim will force-close the channel and claim their timeout-path in the same manner, effectively canceling back the initial htlc amount to the attacker's initial node.

The sender suggests introducing a feebumping race between the victim and the attacker on the tail side of the attack to make it even more costly. They propose aggressively fee-bumping the htlc-output in addition to grabbing the preimage and claiming it on the incoming. This would only be feasible with anchor channels where fees can be added to the htlc-covenant. By using fees up to 50% of the htlc value, the attack would become significantly more costly for the attacker.

Furthermore, the sender suggests adding another mitigation strategy for node runners. They recommend restricting the amount and number of HTLCs (Hashed Time-Locked Contracts) for big channels when dealing with unknown peers. This would minimize losses when the HTLCs the attacker attempts to steal are small.

In conclusion, the sender expresses gratitude for Antoine's explanation and provides additional insights and suggestions related to pinning attacks in the context of Lightning Network.</summary>
