    <summary>Antoine has been thanked for his work on a specific issue. The email confirms that Eclair v0.9.0 includes the described mitigations. It is mentioned that Eclair has been monitoring the mempool for preimages since its early versions, relying on Bitcoin Core's ZMQ notifications for incoming transactions. This ensures that the HTLC success transaction is observed, even if it is immediately replaced, as long as the ZMQ limits are not exceeded. However, it is acknowledged that more fundamental work may be required at the bitcoin layer to strengthen L2 protocols against such attacks. Bastien expresses gratitude towards Antoine and concludes the email.</summary>
