    <summary>In response to Antoine's work on the issue, it has been confirmed that eclair v0.9.0 includes the described mitigations. Eclair has been monitoring the mempool for preimages since its early versions, utilizing Bitcoin Core's ZMQ notifications for incoming transactions. This ensures that the HTLC success transaction is observed, even if it is quickly replaced, as long as the ZMQ limits are not exceeded.

However, Matt suggests that further fundamental work may be required at the bitcoin layer to enhance the resilience of L2 protocols against this type of attacks.</summary>
