    <summary>The email discusses the disclosure of a third mitigation strategy in addition to mempool scanning and transaction re-signing/re-broadcasting. This new strategy involves bumping CLTV delta, which is a common approach to mitigate lightning attacks. Bumping CLTV delta allows node operators to intervene and re-broadcast time-sensitive transactions on other interfaces, such as a secondary full-node if the first one is eclipsed.

The second mitigation strategy mentioned is transaction re-signing, which is believed to impose an economic cost, denominated in fees/feerates, on the attack. However, it is unclear if the game-theory of this cost holds. One factor that may make the attack harder is the deployment of stratum v2, which increases the number of miners with their own block templates. This would require the attacker to continuously replace channels counterparties transactions in multiple miners' mempools. 

To mitigate this attack, a possible solution could be the implementation of a replacement buffer or a history of transactions at the mempool level. This would make it more difficult for the attacker to successfully carry out the attack. It is mentioned that individuals like Tadge and Rusty, who were involved in the early design of lightning, may have additional ideas for mitigations.

Fees are highlighted as a challenging issue in the original paper, indicating that further research and exploration are needed in this area.</summary>
