    <summary>The email discusses various mitigations for lightning attacks in the context of disclosure mails. One of the mitigations mentioned is bumping CLTV delta, which allows node operators to intervene and re-broadcast their time-sensitive transactions on other interfaces if the first one is eclipsed. Another mitigation mentioned is transaction re-signing, which seems to impose an economic cost on the attack in terms of fees or feerates.The effectiveness of this cost in deterring attacks is uncertain, and it is unclear if the game theory behind it holds. The deployment of stratum v2 is suggested as a potential way to make the attack harder, as it increases the number of miners with their own block templates and mempools that the attacker would need to continuously replace channels counterparties transactions in cycles.A possible mitigation that could be explored is the use of a replacement buffer or history of transactions at the mempool level. It is mentioned that individuals like Tadge and Rusty, who were involved in the early design of lightning, might have additional ideas for mitigations. The issue of fees is highlighted as a challenging aspect in the original paper.Overall, the email raises interesting points about different mitigations for lightning attacks and suggests further exploration and discussion on the topic.</summary>
