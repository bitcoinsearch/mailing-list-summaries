    <title>Ordinals BIP PR</title>

    <summary>The email discusses the use of BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) and SLIPs (Standard for Bitcoin Altcoins). The sender expresses disagreement with the claim that BIPs are used for too many things, stating that SLIPs should be used for altcoin-related matters instead. They also suggest that BOLTs (Basis of Lightning Technology) should be merged into BIPs, although this would require effort, cooperation, and involvement from the Lightning development community. 

The sender suggests the need for a third BIP editor since both themselves and another person mentioned (Kalle) have been unable to keep up. They mention that there are several pull requests (PRs) that are more important than the issue regarding Ordinals, which is described as an attack on Bitcoin rather than a proposed improvement. There is a debate in the PR about whether certain clauses in BIP 2, such as "technically unsound" or not in line with the Bitcoin philosophy," are relevant to the issue. These issues need to be resolved before the PR can be merged. 

The sender has already commented on the PR, expressing their own opinions, and emphasizes that ignoring the issues won't make them disappear. They also mention that helping Casey resolve the issues just to further harm or destroy Bitcoin is not worth the time of honest people. The email ends with the signature of the sender.</summary>
