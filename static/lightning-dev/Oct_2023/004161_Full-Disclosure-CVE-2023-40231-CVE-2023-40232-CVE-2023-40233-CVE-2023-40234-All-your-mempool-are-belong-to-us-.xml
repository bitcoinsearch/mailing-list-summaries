    <summary>The email suggests applying the concept of a presigned fee multiplier to HTLC (Hashed Time-Locked Contract) spends in order to prevent replacement cycles. The proposal involves modifying HTLC scripts so that both parties can only spend the HTLC through presigned second-stage transactions, which are always signed with SIGHASH_ALL. This modification would prevent an attacker from adding inputs to their presigned transaction, effectively making a replacement cycling attack impossible. However, implementing this solution would require additional bookkeeping and result in less fee granularity when claiming HTLCs on the blockchain.</summary>
