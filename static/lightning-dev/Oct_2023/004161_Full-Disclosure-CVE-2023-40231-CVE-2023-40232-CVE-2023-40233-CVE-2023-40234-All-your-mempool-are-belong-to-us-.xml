    <summary>The email suggests implementing a presigned fee multiplier concept to prevent replacement cycles in HTLC spends. The proposal involves modifying HTLC scripts so that both parties can only spend the HTLC using presigned second-stage transactions, which are always signed with SIGHASH_ALL. This modification would prevent attackers from adding inputs to their presigned transaction, thereby making a replacement cycling attack impossible. However, implementing this solution would require additional bookkeeping and result in less fee granularity when claiming HTLCs on the chain.</summary>
