    <summary>The email raises a question about the purpose of anchor outputs besides increasing fees. The writer suggests that if they have already pre-signed the full fee range, anchor outputs become unnecessary. They argue that in any situation, they can simply broadcast a transaction with a high enough fee to ensure it gets mined. 

It seems that the writer is questioning the need for anchor outputs and is seeking clarification on their other potential uses. However, no specific examples or explanations are provided in the email.

Please note that the email includes a link to https://petertodd.org, but it is unclear how this link relates to the discussion or if it provides any additional information.</summary>
