    <summary>The email raises a question about the purpose of anchor outputs other than increasing fees. The sender suggests that if they have already pre-signed the full fee range, there would be no need for anchor outputs. They argue that regardless of the situation, they can simply broadcast a transaction with a sufficiently high fee to ensure it gets mined. The email includes a link to https://petertodd.org, which may provide further information on this topic.

It is unclear from the email whether the sender is seeking more information or expressing their opinion on the matter. However, they seem to be questioning the necessity of anchor outputs in certain scenarios.</summary>
