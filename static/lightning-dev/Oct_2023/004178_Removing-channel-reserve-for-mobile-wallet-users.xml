    <summary>The email starts with the sender, Ziggie, mentioning that they will open a Pull Request (PR) to the bLIP repository. The purpose of this PR is not explicitly mentioned, but it is stated that it would be useful. 

The next sentence mentions some confusion regarding the phrase "it doesn't work currently without it." The sender is unsure about what exactly this phrase refers to and questions if it is an implementation-specific issue. 

After that, the sender states that if they remove the channel reserve, there would be no need to consider the dust limit. 

Overall, the email is brief and does not provide much specific information. The sender mainly discusses their intention to open a PR and expresses uncertainty about a particular issue.</summary>
