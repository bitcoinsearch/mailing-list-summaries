    <summary>One possible solution to address a potential vulnerability in the use of unconfirmed outputs in HTLC-preimage-spending transactions is by introducing a new opcode called OP_CSV_ALLINPUTS or OP_CSV_OTHERINPUTS. 

The idea behind this solution is that the new opcode would require *all* inputs in the transaction to have a matching nSequence, effectively preventing the use of unconfirmed outputs in the HTLC-preimage-spending transaction. This protection mechanism would safeguard against the replacement cycling attack.

If implemented, the OP_CSV_ALLINPUTS opcode would ensure that all inputs used in the transaction must be confirmed before they can be spent, thus eliminating the risk associated with unconfirmed outputs. Alternatively, the opcode could be named OP_CSV_OTHERINPUTS and still allow the immediate spending of the HTLC output via the preimage branch, while requiring confirmation for any other inputs added for fees.

By implementing either of these opcodes, the vulnerability in the use of unconfirmed outputs in HTLC-preimage-spending transactions can be mitigated, providing better security and protection against potential attacks.</summary>
