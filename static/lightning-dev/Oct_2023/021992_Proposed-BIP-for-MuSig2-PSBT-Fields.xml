    <title>Proposed BIP for MuSig2 PSBT Fields</title>

    <summary>In an email sent by Anthony Towns, he mentions that he had not considered adding a certain feature to the BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) before. The main goal of the BIP was to enable the use of BIP 327. However, Anthony states that this does not prevent the inclusion of a future BIP that specifies how to use adaptor signatures and introduces additional PSBT (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction) fields for it. He believes that these additions are not mutually exclusive and that the proposed fields in his BIP would still work. Anthony admits that he does not possess enough knowledge on the topic to provide substantial insights into how these fields would function.

Additionally, Anthony acknowledges that he has made some minor fixes throughout the day and expresses his intention to consider the suggestion regarding tables made by the recipient of the email. He also shares his frustration with Mediawiki tables, referring to them as the "bane of his existence."

While the farewell part of the email is not provided, it can be assumed that the email concludes after this point.</summary>
