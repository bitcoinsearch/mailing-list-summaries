    <summary>The email suggests a potential solution to address the issue of an attacker attempting to exploit the HTLC-timeout in the Lightning Network. The proposed strategy involves the honest node aggressively fee-bumping and retransmitting the HTLC-timeout as the CLTV delta deadline approaches. Specifically, when the deadline is within 10 blocks, the honest node would increase the fee by 1/10th of the HTLC value for each non-confirmation.

This approach, referred to as the "scorched earth" strategy, may result in significant fees for the honest node. However, it is expected to be more costly for the attacker since each replacement would require burning at least the same amount of fees as the HTLC-timeout fees. Additionally, the attacker would need to perform a replacement every time the honest node fee bumps.

The author believes that this fee-bumping policy can provide sufficient defense against an attacker who is directly performing replacement-cycling in miners' mempools, even if the victim has no visibility into the attack. By continuously increasing the fee as the deadline approaches, the honest node can deter the attacker by making their attacks prohibitively expensive.

It is important to note that this email does not provide any specific implementation details or technical considerations regarding the proposed strategy. Instead, it focuses on the concept of aggressive fee-bumping as a means of defending against potential attacks on the Lightning Network's HTLC-timeout mechanism.</summary>
