    <summary>The email discusses a potential solution to address an attack scenario in a blockchain network. The sender proposes that the honest node aggressively fee-bump and retransmit the HTLC-timeout as the CLTV delta deadline approaches. This approach, suggested by Ziggie, involves increasing the fee by 1/10th of the HTLC value for each non-confirmation within 10 blocks of the deadline.By adopting this "scorched earth" strategy, the honest node would incur significant fees but would make it even more costly for the attacker. The attacker would need to burn at least as much as the HTLC-timeout fees with each replacement attempt, and they would have to repeat this process every time the honest node fee bumps.The sender believes that this fee-bumping policy can provide sufficient defense against the attack, even if the attacker is carrying out replacement-cycling directly in miners' mempools and the victim has no visibility into the attack.It is important to note that the sender's proposal aims to mitigate the attack scenario by imposing higher costs on the attacker through aggressive fee-bumping and retransmission of the HTLC-timeout within a specific timeframe.</summary>
