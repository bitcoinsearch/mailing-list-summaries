    <summary>The email discusses the issue with the current system of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). The sender points out that BIPs being proposals is a problem in itself. They compare it to the RFC (Request for Comments) system, which has a Draft RFC system to avoid assigning numbers to every idea. However, even with this system, there are still challenges with the current BIPs system. One specific problem highlighted is the question of who is in charge. The sender argues that BIPs will always be a centralized system.

The email does not provide further details or examples to support these points. It also includes a link to Peter Todd's website (https://petertodd.org), but it is unclear how this link relates to the discussion.

Overall, the email raises concerns about the current BIPs system and its centralized nature. However, more information or examples would be needed to fully understand the issue and potential solutions.</summary>
