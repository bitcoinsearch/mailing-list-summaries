    <summary>The email discusses a clever idea that is proposed to prevent a specific attack. However, the sender points out that this idea does not actually prevent the attack. The sender explains that the idea creates a situation where multiple individuals can perform the attack, resulting in potential failure for Bob to redeem the received HTLC output. From Carol's perspective, the situation remains unchanged as they can still spend the offered HTLC output after it times out. The sender concludes that this solution is inferior to another method called OP_Expire, which allows Bob to spend the HTLC output at their leisure once the HTLC preimage branch has expired. The sender mentions that people are already using the proposed solution to exploit signature-less ordinal transactions.</summary>
