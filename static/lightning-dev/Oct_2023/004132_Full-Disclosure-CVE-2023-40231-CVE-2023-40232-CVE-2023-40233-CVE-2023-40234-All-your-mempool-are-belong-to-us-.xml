    <summary>In a previous email on August 11th, 2023, the idea of conducting experiments pre-disclosure was discussed. The suggestion was to set up a "black box" Lightning infrastructure on the mainnet to exercise vulnerabilities and mitigations. The plan was to revisit the disclosure date based on the learnings from these experiments. However, due to various factors, such as the limited number of Lightning worldwide experts with the necessary knowledge and understanding to participate in the experiments, and other pending non-disclosed security issues, like the "fake channel DoS vector" revealed on August 23rd, 2023, these experiments were not conducted.</summary>
