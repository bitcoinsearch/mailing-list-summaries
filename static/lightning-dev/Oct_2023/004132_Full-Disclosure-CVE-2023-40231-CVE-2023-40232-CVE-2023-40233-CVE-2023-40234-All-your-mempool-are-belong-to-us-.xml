    <summary>In a recent email, the sender acknowledges a previous discussion regarding conducting experiments pre-disclosure. They express their willingness to set up a "black box" Lightning infrastructure on mainnet in order to exercise vulnerabilities and mitigations. The sender suggests that the disclosure date could be adjusted based on the learnings from these experiments. However, due to the limited number of Lightning experts with the necessary knowledge and understanding to participate in the experiments, and the existence of other pending non-disclosed security issues, the experiments were not conducted. Specifically, the sender mentions the "fake channel DoS vector" issue revealed on August 23, 2023.</summary>
