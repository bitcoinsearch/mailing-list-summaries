    <summary>Schnorr signatures are 64 bytes in size, making them efficient for situations like lightning where the transaction form is deterministically derived. Signing 100 extra transactions would only require an additional 6400 bytes, which can be easily transferred even with a slow 100KB/s connection in just 64ms. In this case, latency will still dominate. 

RBF (Replace-By-Fee) has a minimum incremental relay fee of 1sat/vByte by default. By using 100 pre-signed transaction variants to sign every possible minimum incremental relay, a range of 1sat/vByte to 100sat/vByte is covered. This range is believed to be sufficient for getting the transactions mined in any block throughout Bitcoin's entire modern history. 

On the other hand, CPFP (Child-Pays-for-Parent) requires two transactions and thus extra bytes. Unless there are edge cases involving very large transactions in low-fee environments, CPFP is not superior to RBF.
