    <summary>A recent discovery has uncovered a new attack on lightning channels called the replacement cycling attack. This attack poses a risk to the security of funds, even without network mempool congestion. Major lightning implementations have implemented mitigations to prevent this attack, such as aggressive rebroadcasting and local-mempool preimage monitoring. However, other Bitcoin applications using bitcoin script timelocks or multi-party transactions could also be affected. Developers and operators of these applications are advised to investigate potential disruptions caused by these attacks.The replacement cycling attack highlights the ongoing efforts to address vulnerabilities in lightning channels and other Bitcoin protocols. Previous attacks, like pinning attacks, have compromised the safety of lightning channels. Mitigations at the mempool level have been proposed to address pinning attacks, but the replacement cycling attack presents a new challenge. The timeline of events leading up to the discovery and disclosure of this attack spans from 2018 to 2023.In conclusion, while mitigations have been deployed for lightning channels, developers and operators of other Bitcoin applications should assess vulnerabilities and disruptions caused by these attacks. Ongoing research and development are essential for the security of Bitcoin protocols and applications.</summary>
