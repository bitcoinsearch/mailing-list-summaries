    <summary>A new transaction-relay jamming attack has been discovered, posing security risks to lightning channels. This attack can occur regardless of network mempools congestion. Major lightning implementations such as LDK, Eclair, LND, and Core-Lightning have implemented mitigations to prevent replacement cycling attacks. These attacks involve a malicious channel counterparty broadcasting an HTLC-preimage transaction with a higher fee, triggering the replacement of the honest HTLC-timeout from the mempool and leading to double-spending.

The success of the replacement cycling attack depends on factors like the inclusion of the honest HTLC-timeout in the winning block template and the ability to over-connect to miners' mempools and public reachable nodes. To counter this attack, aggressive rebroadcasting and local-mempool preimage monitoring have been deployed by various lightning implementations. Adjusting the default CLTV delta value can also improve defenses against replacement cycling attacks.

Other bitcoin applications using bitcoin script timelocks or multi-party transactions may be vulnerable to denial-of-service vectors under network mempools congestion. However, further investigation is required to determine the extent of the impact. Potential affected applications include on-chain DLCs, coinjoins, payjoins, wallets with time-sensitive paths, peerswap and submarine swaps, batch payouts, and transaction accelerators.

One unresolved issue is the package malleability pinning attacks, which compromise the funds safety of lightning channels. Proposed mitigations at the mempool level may be neutralized by the replacement cycling attack, highlighting the need for further research and development.

The timeline of the discovery and disclosure of the replacement cycling attack is provided, with full disclosure of CVEs related to the attack made on October 16th, 2023.

In conclusion, mitigations have been implemented to address the replacement cycling attack in lightning channels. However, the impact on other bitcoin applications requires further investigation. The discovery of this attack emphasizes the ongoing need for research and development to ensure the security of bitcoin protocols and applications.</summary>
