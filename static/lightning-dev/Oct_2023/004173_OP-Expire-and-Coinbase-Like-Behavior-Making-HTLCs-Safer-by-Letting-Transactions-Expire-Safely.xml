    <summary>The email discusses an alternate design proposal for the taproot annex, which was partially discussed on a previous platform (formerly known as Twitter). The proposed design includes the addition of an `nExpiryTime` field in the taproot annex. This field indicates that the transaction must not exist in a block at or above the specified height.

To implement this design, the mempool should organize transactions into buckets based on their `nExpiryTime`. When a block is reached, all buckets with an `nExpiryTime` less than that block height should be dropped.

Additionally, the proposal suggests adding an `OP_CHECKEXPIRYTIMEVERIFY` opcode, which has similar behavior to the `OP_EXPIRE` opcode proposed by Peter Todd. This new opcode would check if the `nExpiryTime` field exists and has a value equal to or less than the top of the stack.

The main difference between the two proposals is that the email's author suggests adding an explicit field for the `nExpiryTime` value in the taproot annex, whereas Peter Todd's proposal suggests an implicit field within the `CTransaction`.

The author hopes that by making the use of transaction buckets explicit through the `nExpiryTime` field, the design will be better implemented by non-Bitcoin-core implementations. The principle of "explicit is better than implicit" is cited as the rationale behind this choice.

Overall, the email presents an alternative design for the taproot annex, outlining the addition of an `nExpiryTime` field, organizing transactions using buckets, and proposing a new opcode for checking expiry times.</summary>
