    <summary>The author proposes a new gambling system that is similar to Satoshi Dice. This system will be provably fair on the Lightning Network, once PTLCs exist. The security model of this system has been designed in such a way that if the casino cheats, it can be proven, but there is no way to get just rewards through the proof alone. The author states that this approach allows both bets to be sent over Lightning and not reserve funds for the lifetime of the bet. This method requires less capital to run than other methods and is more friendly to the Lightning Network. The wager involves Bob, the better, and Carol, the casino, agreeing to a standard bet with a 1.8% chance of winning and a 50x payout, with up to 200 satoshi stake (10k satoshi max payout). The bet is implemented as Bob and Carol both picking random numbers (b and c, respectively), and the winner being decided based on the relationship between those numbers. To initiate the bet, two messages are used: m1, which specifies the amount owed by Carol to Bob provided certain conditions are met, and m2, which specifies the values of b and c chosen by Bob and Carol.</summary>
