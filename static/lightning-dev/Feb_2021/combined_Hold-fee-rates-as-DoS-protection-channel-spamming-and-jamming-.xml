    <summary>A discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list has raised concerns over accidental channel closure, with some suggesting that developers should focus on fixing this problem rather than implementing an anti-Denial of Service (DoS) fee mechanism. The cost of closing and reopening a channel is significant compared to any anti-DoS fee, which may deter nodes from operating. It was suggested that the solution proposed in 2015, involving closing out the channel and sending back a proof of closure, may be more desirable. Additionally, it was proposed that services that require long-lived Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) can flag them as such in the onion payload, allowing nodes to preferentially forward or reject them. However, there are concerns about how high a fee is considered "adequate" deterrence without dramatically increasing the cost of node operation in the average case. If an attacker has a large budget to blow with no direct gain, most parametrizations of attempt fees are likely insufficient. Furthermore, if the HTLC attempt/hold fees rise well above routing fees, then costs are also increased for senders in addition to routing nodes. Decaying fee ideas need closer examination to ensure they do not increase the day-to-day operational cost of a routing node in order to defend against threats at the edges.It was suggested that efforts should be focused on ensuring network turbulence can gracefully degrade to a slightly more restricted operating mode until the storm passes. This could serve as a low-cost deterrence mechanism that won't tangibly increase operation/forwarding/payment costs within the network. Nodes wishing to be compensated for committing capital to Lightning itself can also use markets like Lightning Pool to reward them for allocating the capital for a period of time. Finally, there were concerns raised about privacy issues with incrementing hold fees along a payment path, as this could leak an upper bound on the distance to the payer and payee, making it easier to associate a single payment-part with the payer and payee.</summary>
