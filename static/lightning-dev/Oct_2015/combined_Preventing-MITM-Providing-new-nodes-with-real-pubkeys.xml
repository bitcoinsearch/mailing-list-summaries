    <summary>The conversation revolves around the risks and challenges associated with joining the Lightning Network. Mats Jerratsch mentions that opening a channel on the network requires locking some money into the channel for a specified period, which can be exploited by attackers to vandalize the system. However, another participant suggests that one can join the network even if they have 90% hostile nodes by finding at least one good node. The probability of finding a reliable node is about 1-(V/T)^N, where V represents vandals and T represents total nodes.The participants also discuss different types of attacks that could occur in the Lightning Network, such as Sybil attacks and creating fake edges in the routing graph. One solution suggested by Rusty Russell is to monitor the blockchain for spends of your own anchors to check the anchor. Another solution involves setting up a channel and paying 1 satoshi to each merchant ID of interest to verify connectivity for both parties. By doing this, people can trustlessly avoid "fake" lightning networks without additional infrastructure.In conclusion, coping with unreliability is essential when using the Lightning Network. Running a node that works sometimes but is deliberately unreliable takes more effort than running a node that claims to work but never does. To avoid potential attacks, it's important to take necessary precautions and implement security measures while using the network.</summary>
