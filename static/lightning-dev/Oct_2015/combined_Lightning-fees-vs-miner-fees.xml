    <summary>The impact of the Lightning Network on miner fees in Bitcoin has been a topic of ongoing discussion. The blockchain relies on transaction fees to be secure, so Lightning needs to leave enough transactions for the blockchain to function. Basic assumptions include limiting the number of transactions per block, miners choosing transactions that pay the highest fees to fill blocks, and some people being priced out of using Bitcoin due to cheaper alternatives at given per-transaction fees.Without Lightning, Visa charges about 20c+2% per transaction while Lightning will charge 1% for a full transaction (e.g., 8 hops, 0.125% per hop). If the number of transactions per block stays constant, the transactions selected will also be the same, but fees paid to miners will reduce by about half. Bitcoin can scale by moving low-value transactions to a second layer, while leaving high-value transactions for the most secure mechanism. However, there are several caveats to these suggestions. For instance, the log-normal distribution may not be accurate, the numbers from Visa may be inaccurate or incomplete, and Visa, Bitcoin, and Lightning are not exact substitutes. Additionally, increased adoption likely has some correlation to transaction sizes. Early adopters probably have a different distribution of transaction amounts compared to late adopters, and current fees of up to ~2c/tx differ wildly from the above estimates of $2 to $4 as the revenue maximizing fees for miners above.In an email exchange, Pierre addressed the assumption that Bitcoin transactions and Lightning Network transactions are completely independent. He pointed out that anchor transactions make this assumption not entirely true. Rusty Russell and Anthony Towns discussed the impact of bitcoin adoption and how the proportion of users would matter for adoption rates and comparing the number of bytes needed for lightning anchor transactions on the blockchain.On October 27, 2015, Anthony Towns expressed the view that micropayments market is significantly smaller than other markets. He mentioned that transactions in this market amounts to only $10 billion per year and payments under $12 are considered as "micropayment". In a discussion about Bitcoin's capacity, it was proposed to use a market to determine its capacity. The idea of fixing it in code would lead to bad results, and the concept of variable fees based on transaction size was introduced.The discussion also included whether miners can operate as a cartel and force fees to rise. It was suggested that if miners accept different transactions with different fees, it introduces timing issues, and a cartel would consider such complications in their analysis. However, alternative payment methods could undercut prices, and bitcoin fees would likely remain at "free market" rates rather than anything extortionate.</summary>
