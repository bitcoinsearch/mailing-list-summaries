    <summary>Bitcoin's micropayments market is significantly smaller compared to other markets, with a volume of transactions only amounting to $10 billion per year. The impact of a fully armed and operational Lightning Network on miner fees in Bitcoin has been discussed, with market forces determining the number of Lightning transactions that can be done before it reduces security. Moving low value transactions to a second layer could cut 95% of transaction volume and increase total dollar volume capacity by a factor of 100, reaching $3600B with the same 1 MB blocksize. In a conversation between Rusty Russell and Anthony Towns, the two discussed the impact of bitcoin adoption, with Towns arguing that as bitcoin adoption increases, fees will rise or the number of transactions per block will increase proportionally if there is no lightning network. Russell brought up Metcalf's law, which states that both sides need to "know about bitcoin" for it to be adopted. Pierre also addressed this assumption, stating that it is necessary to consider how much people know about Bitcoin and its potential growth.Variable fees based on transaction size were introduced as important for Bitcoin's capacity. It is advantageous if fees are variable by transaction size, and Bitcoin should handle both large nominal volumes and low transaction volumes. If mining is decentralized and individual miners make the blocks instead of pool operators, they may not be an effective cartel capable of forcing fees higher. In a free market with many independent actors, lower prices are expected than in a market operated by a monopoly/cartel. Natural limits to including transactions in blocks exist due to costs involved. Anthony Towns suggests that without lightning, as bitcoin adoption increases, either fees rise or the number of transactions per block increases proportionally.The idea of using a market to determine Bitcoin's capacity was proposed, which could set capacity by demand triggering supply rather than fixing it in code. Pierre responded to aj's consideration of bitcoin transactions and lightning transactions as independent, pointing out that anchor transactions make this assumption not entirely true. He suggests that it may be worth stating this explicitly. Aj agreed with Pierre's observation and considered the frequency of anchor transactions, noting that it could add an extra 7MB per block compared to the 8MB of high-value transactions from Visa at 10% adoption. The article notes that different miners take different times to download+verify blocks, which was not taken into account in estimations. The conversation between Rusty Russell and Anthony Towns also discussed the impact of bitcoin adoption on fees and transaction volume, considering Metcalf's law and the potential growth of Bitcoin.</summary>
