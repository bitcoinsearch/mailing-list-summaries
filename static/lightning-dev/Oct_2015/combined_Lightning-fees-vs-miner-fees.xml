    <summary>The impact of a fully operational Lightning Network on miners' fees is a question that has been raised multiple times. It is important to ensure that the blockchain has enough transactions to remain secure. Assuming that developers and miners limit the number of transactions per block and that miners choose transactions with the highest fees, it can be concluded that rational miners will limit the number of transactions they accept to prevent fees from dropping to zero. Market assumptions suggest that Bitcoin needs adoption and lower transaction fees to replace credit card transactions. Visa processes 1,900 transactions per second in the US and charges about $117 per transaction. The micropayments market is much smaller, with only $10 billion in volume per year. By assuming that payments are distributed log-normally, it is possible to calculate the parameters median=77.669 and sigma=0.9021.Without Lightning, Visa and the blockchain get more expensive as transaction amounts increase, but Bitcoin doesn't. In this case, the highest value N transactions will fill up the blockchain, at a fee equal to about 20c+2% of the smallest transaction. Without Lightning, fees would increase rapidly with adoption. With Lightning, the outcome for miners is the same as if Visa dropped its rates to a flat 1%. If the number of transactions per block stays constant, the transactions actually selected will also be the same, but fees paid to miners will reduce by about half.Lightning nodes would take the majority of transactions, earning roughly $107M in fees per day, compared to $750,000 in fees per block without Lightning. Given the log-normal distribution in (8), at 100% adoption and 100% availability of Lightning, the optimal blocksize would be about 83MB, and the corresponding fee would be about $2.02. This implies a rate of 276 tx/second on the blockchain, and miner revenue of about $335,000 in fees per block.In a scenario where miners are not organized, it becomes difficult to come up with an accurate figure for fees or miner revenue. However, if miners act as a cartel, they can use the soft-fork protocol to make and enforce any decisions. According to calculations, the revenue-maximizing per-transaction fee for miners is $2.02 with lightning. The optimal blocksize scales proportionally with adoption rates and varies depending on the fee charged by lightning nodes. Lightning payments are confirmed immediately, unlike bitcoin transactions which take some time to be confirmed, and lightning is better suited for micropayments. However, bitcoin has additional demand on it beyond Visa's current market because it can execute smart contracts. Furthermore, unlike Visa, lightning and bitcoin do not naturally support payments on credit or fraud protection for consumers. Finally, while current fees of up to ~2c/tx differ wildly from the above estimates of $2 to $4 as the revenue maximising fees for miners above, given alternative methods of payment take 1%-2% in fees, this might just mean miners aren't maximizing fee revenue at present.The email conversation discusses the revenue optimization for miners by accepting transactions at certain fees and timeframes. It is suggested that accepting all transactions above 90c immediately and any transaction 50 minutes old or more at 25c would generate around $1400 in fees, which is more than other options such as just accepting 100c or 30c txs. A non-cartel miner with 17% hashpower could have a different policy and accept lower fee transactions, but this may not spoil the market easily due to the timeliness of confirmations and alternative payment methods like lightning, altcoins, or fiat payments. The discussion also touches on Metcalf's law and anchor transactions in relation to adoption rates. Lastly, there's a correction made to the micropayments market size.</summary>
