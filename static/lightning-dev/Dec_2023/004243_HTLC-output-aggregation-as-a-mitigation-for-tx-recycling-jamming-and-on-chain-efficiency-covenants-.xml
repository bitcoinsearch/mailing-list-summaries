    <summary>Understanding the potential vulnerabilities in a system is crucial, and Antoine has raised an issue that merits attention. Specifically, Antoine has pointed out a scenario that excludes the possibility of broadcasting a revoked state within the context of Eltoo, a Bitcoin protocol proposal aimed at improving the scalability and interoperability of second-layer solutions such as the Lightning Network.

The correspondence indicates a request for clarification regarding how an attacker might exploit the situation described by Antoine. This implies a need for a concrete example to better understand the risks involved. The concern here revolves around the security implications of not having a mechanism to broadcast a revoked state, which could potentially open up avenues for malicious activities.

Furthermore, there is an acknowledgment of another problem concerning the exponential increase in the number of possible combinations that one must consider in a certain context. This issue could be related to the state management or transaction permutations in a network like Eltoo. Johan is seeking a solution or method to manage this complexity effectively without causing an unmanageable blowup, indicating the importance of efficiency and scalability in system design.

In summary, the exchange between Johan and Antoine revolves around two significant technical challenges: the security concerns arising from the inability to broadcast a revoked state in the Eltoo context and the management of an exponentially increasing number of combinations in a scalable manner. These considerations are pivotal in ensuring the robustness and practicality of systems like Eltoo for broader application in cryptocurrency networks.</summary>
