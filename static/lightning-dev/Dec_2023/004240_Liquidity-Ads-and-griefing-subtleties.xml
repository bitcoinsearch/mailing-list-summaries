    <summary>In a recent discussion, the focus was on choosing between two potential options for a particular implementation. The favored option, as expressed by one of the programmers involved, leans towards the first alternative. This preference is grounded in the concern that the second option may leave sellers vulnerable to specific types of attacks, which were detailed previously. These attacks could adversely affect the seller's ability to accurately determine the appropriate pricing for their channel due to uncertainties about the actual amount of liquidity that could be locked.

The programmer acknowledges that there is room for debate on this matter, indicating an openness to consider different viewpoints. However, the inclination towards the first option is based on the desire to protect sellers from the risks associated with the attack scenario outlined. Despite the need for a decision, the team seems to recognize the importance of weighing the pros and cons of each option before reaching a consensus.</summary>
