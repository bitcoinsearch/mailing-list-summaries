    <summary>Understanding the behavior of miners in cryptocurrency networks is essential for maintaining the system's integrity. Within these systems, users have the capability to compensate miners through offchain payments. This practice allows miners to construct blocks where the discrepancy between the inputs and outputs surpasses the fees typically paid by engaging in what can be characterized as "dishonest mining." This phenomenon underscores the reliance on having an adequate proportion of honest miners in the network, particularly when considering Fee Dominant Transactions (FDTs). The current state of onchain fees appears to mirror network congestion levels, indicating that transaction processing times may be affected during periods of high demand. The dynamics between user fees, miner honesty, and network congestion are critical factors in evaluating the stability and reliability of blockchain-based transactions.</summary>
