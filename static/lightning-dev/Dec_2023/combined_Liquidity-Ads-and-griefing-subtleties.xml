    <summary>Programmers developing a transactional system are examining liquidity guarantees, focusing on ensuring buyers can consistently receive payments and sellers maintain minimum liquidity levels. Rapid re-provisioning of depleted liquidity is vital but challenging due to high chain fees for small transactions. Timelocks have been deemed ineffective in incentivizing sellers to preserve liquidity. Instead, routing fees and lease fees are considered better incentives, with reputation risk playing a significant role in ensuring proper behavior among those offering leases. To prevent improper conduct without tying up funds, a streaming lease payment strategy has been suggested that would allow sellers to close channels upon defaults.

The complexity of managing concurrent leases has sparked debate, including the introduction of quiescence sessions to synchronize commitment transaction updates and the risks of compatibility issues or forced closures. A simplification proposal recommends eliminating CLTV on the seller's side to let market dynamics naturally allocate liquidity. Examples provided suggest encumbering the seller's sats with CLTV until a set limit, allowing early access to liquidity through common strategies.

Flexibility in lease durations has also been proposed, with temporary liquidity provisions for one-directional transfers until a predefined amount is reached. This model considers operators' preferences for transactions based on specific inbound liquidity amounts rather than fixed durations. An advanced fund management strategy introduces distinct counters for different states of the seller's funds (`to_local`, `to_local_leased`, `to_local_leased_owed`) and underscores the importance of HTLC fulfillment order and commitment transaction construction to handle overlapping leases effectively.

In cryptocurrency transactions, particularly lightning networks, programmers discuss creating separate `to_local_leased_owed` buckets for each lease and ordering them by expiry dates to ensure fairness and prevent exploitation. Extensive testing is needed to counter potential cheating and understand the implications of increased commitment transaction weights. Balancing channel capacity and ownership is crucial, using CLTV as a security tool. For example, Bob's purchased amount should be CLTV-encumbered, while additional funds should remain liquid. Funds not used for purchases should not be encumbered, preserving the system's integrity.

A policy is outlined where the first 10,000 satoshis from the seller are CLTV-bound, with excess processed normally. Prioritizing depletion of standard outputs over CLTV-bound funds when processing outgoing HTLCs is recommended, refilling the CLTV output before normal outputs. The discussion also includes applying lease timelocks to HTLC outputs and capping the total value of in-flight HTLCs to safeguard both parties.

Liquidity ads introduce protocol design challenges, such as preventing liquidity griefing attacks and addressing pricing issues. Protection against premature channel closures is considered, balancing the interests of buyers and sellers. Debates include whether to segregate leased funds in commitment transactions and the reputation impact for sellers. The possibility of sellers opting out of CLTV enforcement to attract buyers is discussed, despite risks. Channel splicing complexities are acknowledged, proposing seller restrictions on splicing out but not in, maintaining lease term integrity. Liquidity ads hold promise for the lightning network, with ongoing efforts to include liquidity marketplaces in popular implementations.</summary>
