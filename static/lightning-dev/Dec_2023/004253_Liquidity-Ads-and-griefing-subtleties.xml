    <summary>The email discussion emphasizes the importance of maintaining simplicity in the implementation of certain features. There is a consensus that Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) may not provide enough value to justify its complexity in the present context. A proposal has been suggested where sellers could publish liquidity ads with an option for recurrence using bolt 12 offers. This would allow buyers to make regular payments following the standard bolt 12 procedures, which sellers could then factor into their decision-making regarding channel management and liquidity provisions.

The proposed approach advocates a phased implementation. Initially, a simple version of liquidity ads could be deployed without the need for CLTV or recurring payments. As a subsequent step, once there is broader adoption and deployment of bolt 12, there could be an integration of optional bolt 12 offers into the liquidity ads rates. This incremental strategy aims to streamline the process and avoid unnecessary complications until the technology gains wider acceptance and use.</summary>
