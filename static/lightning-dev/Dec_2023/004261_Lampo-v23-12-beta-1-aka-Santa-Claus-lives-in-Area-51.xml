    <summary>Vincent, a programmer, has spent over a year and a half developing a project called Lampo, inspired by his work on lnprototest for the Lightning Development Kit (LDK). Lampo, which started as an experimental lightning node, evolved into a small, self-contained SDK aimed at facilitating the creation of lightning nodes with LDK.

In March, Vincent undertook the challenge to implement a fully functioning node using the Lampo SDK. He has successfully incorporated the basic commands necessary for operation, which are currently available in part of the code, and is working on adding a help command to improve usability. Despite acknowledging that the current command implementation is not ideal, Vincent confirms that the system is operational.

Moreover, Vincent is in the final stages of setting up integration tests between core lightning (cln) and Lampo. This will be complemented by including lnprototest protocol tests to ensure robustness and compatibility. In an effort to engage the community and foster collaboration, he announces the release of the first public beta version v23.12 of Lampo. Vincent invites users and contributors to provide feedback on desired features and expresses openness to implementing suggestions, though he notes that he may not be able to accommodate all requests. Nevertheless, he encourages the contribution of patches from the community.</summary>
