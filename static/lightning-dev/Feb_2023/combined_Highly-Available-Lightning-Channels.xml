    <summary>The Lightning Network is a decentralized payment system that depends on nodes to route transactions. In order to compete with centralized payment systems, various proposals have been made to improve the Lightning Network's efficiency and reliability. One of these proposals is building forward-error-correction code on top of MPP to reduce payment latency. Another suggestion is adding more signal channels between HTLC senders and routing nodes offering capital liquidity for better allocation of capital.Maintaining outbound liquidity on the Lightning Network is also vital, and one way to ensure this is by setting the flag for maintaining high availability (HA). However, it can be challenging to determine the appropriate threshold for setting this flag and whether the channel is usually saturating in the inbound direction. To optimize the payment process, it is crucial to choose the best possible routes rather than making a judgment on the honesty or reliability of a node.Reputation systems in Lightning Networks are useful but hard to get right. Local knowledge gets outdated over time, making it difficult to make good decisions. One suggestion is to ask altruistic nodes for scoring data instead of relying on hearsay. Penalizing nodes could lead to node operators playing stupid games to avoid perceived penalties.In a discussion between Matt and Joost about the Lightning Network (LN) routing, Joost suggests that nodes should rely on measurement instead of signaling to prefer routes through nodes that reliably route payments. He argues that highly available (HA) signaling is directional and can create issues with deciding at what threshold a signal becomes HA. Furthermore, he disagrees with the idea of building LN out of high reliability nodes as it creates centralization pressure.To increase payment success rates, the Lightning Network proposes adding a new bit for routing nodes to signal their highly available channels through the `channel_update` field `channel_flags`. This flag would allow payers to prefer highly available channels during pathfinding, but the routing node would face a stronger penalty than usual if it returns a failure. The proposal also includes a variation that signals availability implicitly through routing fees, but it may disincentivize cheap but reliable channels on high traffic links.Public data can be found at https://river.com/learn/files/river-lightning-report.pdf, but ultimately it is impossible to know exactly what is happening on the lightning network. These ongoing efforts reflect attempts to improve the efficiency and reliability of the Lightning Network while addressing potential issues related to centralization and reputation systems.</summary>
