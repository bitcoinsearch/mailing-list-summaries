    <summary>The Lightning-dev mailing list has been discussing ways to improve the security and efficiency of the Lightning Network. One issue debated is the need for nodes to have confidence in the locking of funding transactions. While proof of funds locked is required for DoS resistance, Matt Corallo suggested that other methods could be used instead, including non-lightning channels. Nodes require the outpoint of the funding transaction to verify that a channel announced by the nodes is actually locked on the Bitcoin mainchain. The information about the funding transaction is broadcasted in the `channel_announcement` message in the `short_channel_id` field which includes the block number, transaction number, and vout.Another topic of discussion was whether revealing channel capacity publicly during the opening of a channel in the lightning network is necessary or poses a risk. ZmnSCPxj explained that the added complexity is for spam-prevention, not routing in particular. Pathfinding algorithms can use the lower limit of the rangeproof to filter out channels too small to pass a particular payment through. However, not revealing the capacity publicly but providing only a range proof of the attribute could potentially make channels susceptible to channel exhaustion attack or a particular node might be targeted for node isolation attack.The Lightning Network remains censorship-resistant as censorship leads to loss of profit from fees and censors can be evicted by jacking up willingness to pay fees. However, one issue remains route-hijacking, where someone provides routing for a lower fee and users take it. The traits that make one a good forwarding node also makes one a good surveillance node. In general proving 2-of-2 multisig UTXO ownership doesn't do much to prevent route hijacking to begin with, so it shouldn't be much different. There is almost nothing done today to prevent spam and route-hijacks (aka someone providing routing for a lower fee and users happily taking it) in the routing DB today. Anti-DoS could reasonably be accomplished with simple equivalent proofs, though they would be somewhat more expensive to create/validate.</summary>
