    <summary>The Lightning-dev mailing list email conversation discusses the benefits and challenges of maintaining multiple channels in the Lightning Network. The drawbacks of having a single channel include relying on a single peer, which can be a possible point of failure. However, opening multiple channels is beneficial for fault tolerance and privacy. Wallets opening a single channel by default would leak all its user's transfer amounts, making profiling very simple. There are several questions that need to be addressed, including how many channels should be opened, what the fee per channel should be, and how many funds can be relayed at max. When it comes to mobile Lightning Network wallets, supporting only a single payment channel could be beneficial as the majority of LN nodes on mobile devices will likely be offline 99% of the time, making them ineffective in relaying payments. Additionally, if a portion of funds becomes locked in HTLC, it may not be in the user's best interest, especially if the lock lasts for hours. Having a single payment channel improves user experience and simplifies the user interface, making it easier for adoption. Currently, Anton's plan for his Android LN wallet is to support only a single payment channel.Having multiple channels on a phone that can relay third-party payments can bring about several issues such as risking a channel being unilaterally closed due to HTLC expiration if the app does not run at all times. Users will also have to decide how many channels should be opened and what the fee per channel should be. Developers can choose whether to use a single or multiple channels based on their preferences and the needs of their users. The idea of a special payment request protocol that allows for negotiation of multiple routes and details between payer and payee has been proposed. This would involve the payee's QR code containing a server address and other information necessary for the payer to establish a connection with their device. The use of maintenance servers could facilitate this process, with each coffee shop potentially having its own. While there is currently no complete retry logic in place for multipath transfers, clients may soon be able to decide whether to perform such payments if the recipient signals acceptance.Anton Kumaigorodskiy suggests that a protocol for payment requests could be established so that payer and payee can negotiate a number of routes and other details. This proposal involves the use of a QR code with a server address and other necessary details. The recipient would signal its acceptance of multipath transfers, allowing the client to decide whether to perform a multipath payment. If there is a payment failure, the client can try again with a different path. However, the retry logic has yet to be fully developed. Although Anton plans to design their Android LN wallet UI and UX to support a single payment channel, Christian suggests not binding the single channel and the UX too tightly. They emphasized that there is no direct connection between UX and the number of channels. The underlying connections do not have to show up in the UX interface at all, especially if multi-path routes are allowed.</summary>
