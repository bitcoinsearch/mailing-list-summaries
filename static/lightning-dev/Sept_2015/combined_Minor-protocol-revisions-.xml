    <summary>In this discussion between Rusty Russell and Pierre, they agree that the state coverage testing should be more exhaustive. There are a lot of assertions in the code but it is unclear whether they test if everything makes sense or just that nothing crashes. They suggest adding optional traces for successful tests to make it more obvious. They also discuss the need for CLOSE to track HTLCs (and spending when timeouts hit or R's become known). The conversation then shifts to a new version of the svg and updated states for the flow. In addition, there is some discussion around HTLC precision increase, ceiling drop. It is mentioned that 32 bits places a ceiling of 0.04 satoshi on each HTLC, which means keeping the channel balances in 64-bit counters. The conversation ends with the conclusion that having a small maximum is probably helpful for routing and planning how to fund a node.</summary>
