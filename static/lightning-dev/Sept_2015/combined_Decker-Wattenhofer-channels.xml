    <summary>The Bitcoin subreddit recently had a discussion about a proposed fast and scalable payment network with Bitcoin, but it seems to have gotten off track. The proposed alternative to the lightning paper uses timelocks to ensure revocability instead of a key/hash scheme. However, this requires stronger malleability fixes which may not be available anytime soon, and it also sets a decreasing timelock on the channel, limiting its lifetime compared to lightning channels. Additionally, every HTLC on the channel must have a larger timelock on the refund side. Andrew Miller asked about any drawbacks to this proposal, and it may be worth considering further if the chained revocation secrets are found to be insecure or too heavy. Finally, some participants in the discussion believe that setting Delta T to 1 hour is irrelevant and bogus. While the link to the paper is not provided, interested parties can access the Reddit thread via the provided URL.</summary>
