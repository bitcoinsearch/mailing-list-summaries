    <summary>In an email conversation, CJP suggested that in Amiko Pay, payer and payee have direct communication link between each other to coordinate the payment, where they exchange R hash, amount and the address of the meeting point. However, Anthony Towns suggested a lighter initiation, which is essentially just a one-way packet from H (or someone representing H) to A giving hash of R, amount, and the routable lightning address it needs to get to. This way, a lightning transaction can be kicked off by QR code or NFC as well as over TCP, making it easy for adding payment-by-lightning to other protocols. It enables bittorrent client to demand a lightning payment every 10MB, independent of the lightning protocol. There might be a security benefit too as even having a tor connection open to someone gives more chance of finding a buffer overflow and taking control of their system than just viewing a QR code they present to you.</summary>
