    <summary>Chaumian mints are inherently custodial, but Wasabi and WabiSabi avoid this issue by operating as a temporary entity, counterchecked by users of the scheme. ZmnSCPxj introduces nodelets, which allow multiple users to implement a single node without a central custodian, and may allow for similar flexibility of liquidity if there are enough users. Nodelets can connect to a coordinator, then "self-mix" their coins, get back new values, and request that some part of their value be sent over the network. Before signing off on the new state of any channel, the actual nodelets check the new state that the coordinator wants them to sign off on, thus preventing custodial risk.A discussion about federated mint has been going on for some time, with the focus on replacing blinded signatures with blinded credentials. The use of tokens of the same denomination in traditional mints is inefficient, so introducing blind signatures committed to a separately blinded amount would allow one big anonymity set over all tokens instead. However, there are still obstacles to overcome, including the use of KVACs which do not allow client-side validation and building an enhanced threshold blind signature scheme which is more complex, needing further research.ZmnSCPxj became interested in blind mints while thinking about Lightning Network wallet usability issues, such as channel unavailability due to force closes, managing liquidity, and the unpredictability of the on-chain fee environment. To address these problems, he developed CLBOSS, which manages a C-Lightning node for non-technical users. Both systems have different target audiences, with federated mints seen as a replacement for banks and other custodial services used for their superior UX. While Bitcoin Beach currently uses Galoy, a centralized hosted LN wallet without much privacy, if community-driven federations with privacy built-in were allowed, most risks inherent to custodial wallets could be mitigated.</summary>
