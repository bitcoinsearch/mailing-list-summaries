    <summary>The Lightning Network community has been discussing the limitations of the existing BOLT process and the need for a new process to manage features and best practices that arise outside of it. One proposed solution is to add a BIP-style process called bLIPs or SPARKs on top of the BOLTs, which would allow app layer best practices to be succinctly described and organized. Developers from various implementations and the broader app layer ecosystem would volunteer to be editors for these bLIPs, similar to the current role of editors in the BIPs.While some members of the community have raised concerns about potential fragmentation and security risks associated with the implementation of bLIPs, others believe that they could address the need for implementers to specify optional features in their sub-protocols, benefiting users who want support for a particular feature. Potential bLIP ideas include each lnurl variant, on-the-fly channel opens, AMP, dynamic commitments, podcast payment metadata, p2p messaging formats, new pathfinding heuristics, remote node connection standards, etc.Ryan Gentry's proposal aims to improve the usability and interoperability of the Lightning Network by providing a community-driven approach to standardization through the bLIP process. This process would complement the existing BOLT process without affecting it, and has been positively received by both app layer and protocol developers. However, some members question the need for another repository and suggest rethinking the current process of the BOLTs to make it more accessible for new ideas to find their way into the BOLTs.The Lightning Network community is exploring options to improve its specification process while maintaining standardization and avoiding fragmentation. The addition of a BIP-style process (bLIPs or SPARKs) on top of the BOLT process has been proposed to provide a more flexible way to evolve the network by allowing for optional features to be added outside of the main specification. This process would be a descriptive home for optional standards and proposals while BOLTs remain prescriptive measures that specify base functionality required for a routing node.The proposed bLIP process has started on Github, and developers from various implementations and the broader app layer ecosystem are encouraged to volunteer as editors for this process. The Lightning Network community believes that the current BOLTs do a good job of specifying what base functionality is required for a routing node in a prescriptive manner, but there is a gap in describing functionality that has emerged over time due to progressive evolution and aren't absolutely necessary but enhance node/wallet operation.In conclusion, the Lightning Network community is discussing the addition of a new process called bLIPs or SPARKs on top of the existing BOLT process to add a place for app layer best practices to be organized and described. While some members question the need for another repository, proponents believe that it would bring features built outside of the BOLT process into the fold. Rene Pickhardt suggests rethinking the current process of the BOLTs to make it more accessible for new ideas to find their way into the BOLTs.</summary>
