    <summary>ZmnSCPxj proposed a solution for WatchTowers to prevent theft attempts on SegWit transactions. However, using a "swap this blob" approach for updating channels could lead to privacy leaks as attackers can identify which WatchTowers are being used and disable them. To prevent this, the WatchTower could demand a public key and signature or know a stable identity of the victim and attacker. A ticket scheme that charges for each `(txid[:16], blob)` pair it stores and monitors could also be implemented. Clients can add randomization to de-correlate their updates and batch several updates into a single message. In a Lightning-dev discussion, ZmnSCPxj proposed a trustless, blinded WatchTower approach for eltoo channels using the "encrypted blob" used in Poon-Dryja channels. However, update transactions in Decker-Russell-Osuntokun channels have no txid that can be used as a key for encrypted blobs, making it possible for the WatchTower to correlate the timing and number of updates of each channel. To mitigate this, clients can add randomization via a timer drawn from a particular distribution, although this comes with the downside of a window of opportunity wherein a new state is at play, but the watchtower hasn't yet been updated.The scalability tradeoff of using the "swap this blob" approach in Decker-Russell-Osuntokun channels is much more scalable, as each watchtower only consumes a bounded amount of space. The proposed method retains anonymity sets while transitioning from Poon-Dryja to Decker-Russell-Osuntokun channels. For Decker-Russell-Osuntokun channels, the blob would contain state number, pubkeys, signatures, settlement details, and payment information. The WatchTower generates future update transactions iteratively until it finds the last channel update or reaches the maximum state number. It can then publish the latest update transaction and corresponding settlement transaction to provide justice.However, the proposed method requires a large amount of grinding on the WatchTower's part. In case of a theft attempt, the WatchTower may be able to correlate blobs to a specific channel and reduce privacy leakage by not giving all updates to a single WatchTower. The email discusses a proposed solution for WatchTowers to monitor and prevent theft attempts on SegWit transactions.</summary>
