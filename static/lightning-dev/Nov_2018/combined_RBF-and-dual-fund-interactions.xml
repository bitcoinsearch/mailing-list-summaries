    <summary>The Lightning-dev post highlights an attack vector that occurs when a liquidity provider owns a single UTXO containing its entire funding and where RBF and dual-fund have complex interactions. If the first customer's funding transaction is RBFed, the second customer's transaction can be removed from mempools, causing the liquidity provider to ask the second customer to sign a new transaction. This can potentially create an attack vector wherein the second customer can gather all its dust and create a large transaction with too low of a fee rate to be mined but too large of a total fee to get over the RBF rule 1. This would make it difficult for the first customer to get its own channel confirmed unless it pays an uneconomical on-chain fee. The author believes that channel initiation RBF is more important than dual-fund and suggests off-to-onchain services as a solution that can reverse the polarity of the satoshi flow, put funds in cold storage or pay people on-chain.Alternatively, instead of providing change outputs for liquidity providers, the author suggests requiring that liquidity providers cannot have a change output on the funding transaction, which allows the two customers to RBF independently of each other but increases blockchain usage. Rusty suggests noting this in the proposal, though it should not be required.</summary>
