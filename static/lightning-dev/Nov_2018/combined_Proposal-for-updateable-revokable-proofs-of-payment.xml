    <summary>The Lightning Network allows for payment channels to be created without needing to broadcast every transaction to the blockchain. However, there are issues with the current definition of the description field in BOLT11, which may require more details regarding obligations. One way to address this is through two-way communication where the payer sends data to the payee and then the payee makes the payment request including this data. Proofs of payment may be too inflexible for real-life applications, so a "contract update" format may be necessary to cover cases such as full refunds, partial refunds, and changes in conditions without change of payment. The contract update includes new obligations of the two parties to each other, a secure hash of the previous contract version that is replaced by this one, signatures from both parties, and optionally, a payment hash. It is considered valid only if certain conditions are met, such as the signatures corresponding to the pubkeys in the original contract.The sender of the email proposes that most of their proposal can be achieved by writing things in human-readable form in the description field, although they suggest including a payer pubkey in the original invoice. Requiring two signatures on each update is more generic than allowing one party to unilaterally nullify an old contract and allows for obligations on both parties.</summary>
