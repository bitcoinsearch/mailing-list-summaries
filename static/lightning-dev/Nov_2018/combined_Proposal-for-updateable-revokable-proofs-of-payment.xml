    <summary>The Lightning Network allows parties to transact without broadcasting every transaction to the blockchain. However, issues arise when the payer is not identified in the contract, and a proof of payment may be too inflexible for real-life applications. A "contract update" format may fix this issue by including new obligations of the two parties to each other, a secure hash of the previous contract version, signatures from both parties, and optionally, a payment hash. The contract update is considered valid only if certain conditions are met. The sender of an email suggests that most of their proposal can be achieved by writing things in human-readable form in the description field, which puts things into a machine-readable form aiding automated processing and a better UI experience. They note that requiring two signatures (payer and payee) on each update is more generic than allowing one party to nullify an old contract unilaterally. CJP on the lightning-dev mailing list discusses the current definition of the description field in BOLT11, which is vague and may require more details regarding obligations. BOLT11 payment requests can be seen as option contracts. If payment happens, the payee has an obligation to deliver what was described in the contract. Two-way communication can solve the issue of identifying the payer in the contract. The potential issue with the "contract update chain" is that it can fork, which can be avoided by not signing the forking update.</summary>
