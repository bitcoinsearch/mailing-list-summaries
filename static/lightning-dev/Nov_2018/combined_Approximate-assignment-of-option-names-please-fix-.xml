    <summary>Rusty Russell has shared his thoughts on global vs local bit feature masks, suggesting that local features only affect the protocol between two nodes while global features can affect HTLCs and are advertised to other nodes. He also suggests that there may be instances where one would want to promote their local bit to a global bit in order to advertise it. Pierre suggests getting rid of the global/local distinction and using node_features in the node_announcement message instead. In a post on Lightning-dev, Corné Plooy suggests that while there may not be a bitmap distinction between local and global feature bits, there still exists a mental distinction. ZmnSCPxj and Olaoluwa Osuntokun discuss the nature of OG AMP payments in Lightning, with ZmnSCPxj arguing that they are spontaneous and may not require an invoice to tag a payment, while Osuntokun believes that invoices can still be used to tag payments. Laolu corrects an earlier statement that OG AMP payments cannot be accompanied by an invoice. Rusty Russell prompts the developers to edit their feature bits as appropriate before he assigns bit numbers.The global/local distinction in feature masks is being questioned as it seems to have no practical use currently. Rusty originally thought that local features would become ubiquitous over time, making it unnecessary to pre-filter by them. However, Pierre challenges this definition, stating that he would want to advertise his support for a local feature such as option_data_loss_protect. There may be a gossip design where basic gossip data is received first and extended data is obtained based on enabled feature bits. Nonetheless, local features could become ubiquitous over time, making pre-filtering unnecessary and rendering the local/global distinction obsolete.</summary>
