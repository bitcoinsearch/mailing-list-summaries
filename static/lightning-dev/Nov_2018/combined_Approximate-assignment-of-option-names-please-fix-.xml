    <summary>The Lightning-dev mailing list has been discussing the feature masks for local and global bits in the Lightning Network. Rusty Russell suggests promoting local bits to global bits, but if every node will eventually support a bit, it should stay local. The OG AMP feature is spontaneous and may not have an invoice, so it should be a global feature. It is questioned whether to tie spontaneous payment to OG AMP or support one that is payable by base AMP or normal singlepath. Additionally, merging `option_switch_ephkey` and `option_og_amp` into `option_extra_onion_packet_types` is suggested as both require understanding extended onion packet types. Pierre challenges the current definition of local and global feature masks, arguing that he would like to advertise the fact that his node supports 'option_data_loss_protect,' which is a local feature. He further suggests getting rid of the global/local distinction and using node_features in the node_announcement message to describe the features that his node supports/requires and connection_features in the init message set for this particular connection. Corné Plooy suggests that the global/local distinction in routing might not be necessary as current features don't seem to require it, but Rusty suggests that users should not set compulsory feature bits in their node_announcements unless they want to stop routing.ZmnSCPxj and Olaoluwa Osuntokun discuss the nature of OG AMP payments in Lightning, with ZmnSCPxj arguing that OG AMP payments are spontaneous and may not require an invoice, whereas Osuntokun believes that invoices can still be used to tag payments. The use of an 8-byte identifier in the invoice can signal a service or good to be dispersed once a payment is received. Rusty Russell prompts the developers to edit their feature bits as appropriate before he assigns bit numbers. The email thread aims to assign bit numbers soon and can be found on the Lightning-dev mailing list.</summary>
