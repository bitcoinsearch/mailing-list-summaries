    <summary>ZmnSCPxj has proposed an idea for a meta-vending machine that consists of vending machines and dispenses them for proof-of-payment. The contents of each box are initially visible, and sellers can rent these boxes by paying the machine owner. The box then requests an invoice for the product. If someone decides to purchase the product, the meta-vending machine provides the invoice and opens the box in exchange for the preimage to the hash in the invoice. This system would be useful for selling small items and as an anonymous rendezvous point for transferring small items in exchange for money.However, trust is needed in the meta-vending machine owner, as they have the ability to unlock any arbitrary box and take the item inside. In order to avoid theft, a solution has been proposed for vending machines. The machine must be offline and without secret keys, but the owner has a separate Lightning node to receive payments. Each machine contains a fixed number of hashes and invoice signatures corresponding to each hash, with a 1-bit flag that is set when claimed.When a customer requests a purchase, the machine searches for an available hash and generates an invoice. The customer pays normally, and the vending machine owner receives the payment and releases the preimage as proof-of-payment. The customer provides the preimage to the machine, which checks it against the list of hashes and sets the claim flag if valid. The product is then released. The supply of hashes can be replenished by the owner of the vending machine when restocking the machine.However, there is no way to refund payment in case of mechanical failure. Overall, this system provides a secure and efficient way to sell small items while ensuring that payment is made before the product is released.</summary>
