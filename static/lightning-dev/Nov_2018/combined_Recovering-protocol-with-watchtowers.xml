    <summary>Margherita Favaretto has proposed a solution for the recovering mechanism of false positives in the Lightning network. Her design involves using watchtowers, which are full nodes that are online 24/7 and can guarantee service. Margherita suggests that it may be possible for e-commerce organizations to offer a service of "Watchtower-Recovery" that nodes can purchase to back up their commitments data. Watchtowers have two functions: monitoring the status channel and acting as a backup mechanism. The payload is encrypted by the public key of node A, so watchtowers cannot decrypt the payload or modify it. Alice must ask all her watchtowers for information connected to her node when she needs the backup of all her data. Margherita asks if it makes sense to overlap the concept of watchtower with the mechanism of backup.Margherita has defined two new concepts, nonce-time Tn, which is the current value of nonce-time, and payload P, which consists of a zip of all status channels of a node A at a specific time T1. The idea is not to send all data to all watchtowers, but instead, Alice sends the actual nonce-time and payload to one watchtower and just sends the new nonce-time to the others. Margherita suggests using more than one watchtower to mitigate the risk that a single watchtower is attacked and all data inside it is deleted. Every time node A requests data for backup from the watchtower, she sends a small fee through the Lightning channel. Margherita's design mitigates risks such as a watchtower sending an older payload instead of the last one and watchtowers changing the nonce-time.The use of a node public key as the key for backup in a solution and its incompatibility with watchtowers, which are currently designed to be keyed to a txid, is discussed. A scheme that encrypts payload information on the public key of the node and uses channel ID to prevent malicious activity is suggested. However, this solution is vulnerable to corrupted backup data, which would render the operation of the node irrecoverable. It is also noted that each watchtower must have a distinct payment channel, thus raising questions about why the watchtower is keyed to the node rather than something specific to each payment channel. DHT is recommended as a better alternative for distributed backup implementation.Overall, Margherita's solution involves defining two new concepts, using watchtowers as backup nodes, and securing the payload by encrypting it with the public key of the node A. Her design mitigates risks such as a watchtower sending an older payload instead of the last one and watchtowers changing the nonce-time. However, there is still a risk if 51% of the watchtower agrees to cheat and sends another nonce-time to the node.</summary>
