    <summary>A group of Lightning implementers met in Milan two years ago to start the Lightning Specification 1.0 and recently, the 18 most active spec contributors gathered in Adelaide to kick off version 1.1. After two days, they emerged with 30 accepted changes for the next version, many detailed and some requiring further on-list refinement. The highlights include multi-path payments, dual-funded channels, splicing, wumbo, hidden destinations, and many gossip improvements. Wumbo is a term used to mean "maxi" or removing the channel capacity limit. Hidden destinations refer to rendezvous routing as explained in the Rendez-vous Routing thread by CJP on the list.The work points have been transferred to the Wiki where interested people can join in the continuing discussion. In a response email, Cezary Dziemian expressed excitement about dual-funded channels but was unsure about "Wumbo" and "hidden destinations", requesting Rusty Russell to explain or provide links. The discussion revolves around the use of the made-up word 'wumbo' and whether it should follow typical grammar rules or have its own grammar. The concern is that if we limit ourselves to traditional grammar, it may restrict our ability to define novel grammar for made-up words in the future.However, it is suggested that we should not create our own grammar without ensuring that it is understandable. The conversation appears to be light-hearted, with one participant playfully using incorrect grammar while the other corrects them. Lastly, two years ago, a group of Lightning implementers gathered in Milan to start the Lightning Specification 1.0. Recently, the 18 most active spec contributors met in Adelaide to kick off version 1.1. After two days of discussion, 30 changes were accepted for the next version, including multi-path payments, dual-funded channels, splicing, wumbo, hidden destinations, and many gossip improvements. These changes are now available for further refinement on the Wiki, and a group photo was taken to commemorate the event.</summary>
