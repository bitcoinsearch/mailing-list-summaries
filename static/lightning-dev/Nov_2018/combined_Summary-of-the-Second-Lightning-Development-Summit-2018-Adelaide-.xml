    <summary>Recently, the 18 most active contributors of Lightning Specification 1.0 met in Adelaide to kick off version 1.1 and they have accepted 30 changes for its next version including multi-path payments, dual-funded channels, splicing, wumbo, hidden destinations, and many gossip improvements. Wumbo is a made-up term referring to removing the channel capacity limit, while hidden destinations refer to rendezvous routing. The work points have been transferred to the Wiki where further discussion can take place. The discussion in the context revolves around the use of the word 'wumbo' and whether it should follow typical grammar rules or have its own grammar. The question arises if imposing normal grammar on a made-up word is necessary. The concern is that if we limit ourselves to traditional grammar, it may restrict our ability to define novel grammar for made-up words in the future. However, it is suggested that we should not create our own grammar without ensuring that it is understandable. A group photo was taken to commemorate the event after the contributors worked hard to address some difficult questions and their expertise was greatly appreciated. The Lightning implementers gathered two years ago in Milan to start the Lightning Specification 1.0.</summary>
