    <summary>The Lightning Network protocol has encountered issues when it comes to negotiating sub-satoshi payments. This prompted Gert-Jaap to suggest adding transaction_min_msat_multiple or accept_subsatoshi to allow users to opt-out of parts below 1000 msat that cannot be enforced on-chain. Rusty agreed with Gert-Jaap's suggestion about minimum_depth being chain-dependent but disagreed with opting out of parts below 1000 msat since fees are frequently sub-satoshi and on-chain enforcement is not a guaranteed solution as probabilistic payments can still be gamed.Additionally, Gert-Jaap recommended varying the definition of "dust" with fees and proposing defining minimum_depth per chain instead of a fixed number in the standard to prevent trusted in-flight payments that cannot be enforced on-chain. The email thread suggested dropping max_htlc_value_in_flight_msat, setting channel_reserve_satoshis to be 1%, and making minimum_depth chain-dependent. There were also suggestions for dust_limit_satoshis and max_accepted_htlcs.In general, the message proposed suggestions to re-examine various variables such as funding_satoshis, dust_limit_satoshis, max_htlc_value_in_flight_msat, channel_reserve_satoshis, and minimum_depth based on experience and simplify or refine them. Current values accepted by c-lightning, Eclair, and lnd were provided, and improvements for each variable were suggested based on their current values. For example, rejecting any channel under 3 x min(our_dust_limit, their_dust_limit) and increasing the minimum_depth value to 6 were among the proposals.There are debates among Bitcoin developers about allowing users to choose whether to use satoshis or millisatoshis as the smallest fraction of a Bitcoin in transactions. While some argue that limiting the unit to satoshis could render the system inoperable as fees are frequently sub-satoshi, others believe that staying within the limits of the base layer while achieving benefits from second-layer scaling is important for optimal security. Finding the right configuration options is crucial as too many options can increase complexity. There are also debates over enforceability on the blockchain and how individuals can set limits within their own control.Lastly, the Lightning Network has established minimum and maximum standards for various aspects of its protocol, with suggested improvements proposed by the author. Hidden consensus areas are also being addressed in a new commitment format proposal. The email thread also includes a user requesting assistance in unsubscribing from an email list.</summary>
