    <summary>In the Lightning Network, the implementation of packet switching in the BOLT specification has been deferred, but some features that could enable packet switching were not. These features include multi-hop onion packets, identifying the "next" node by node-ID instead of short-channel-ID, and onion ephemeral key switching. A new packettype is proposed where the "next" node is identified by its node-ID. This would enable packet switching, increase anonymity set of rendezvous routing, allow mapless Lightning nodes to ask a peer to be their pathfinding provider with some uncertainty, and justify multiple features having a single feature bit. Using packet switching allows for some uncertainty about the destination, and it can be used when the channel has no capacity or when there is no channel with the node. However, during a discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, it was noted that spontaneous ephemeral key switches while forwarding a payment are not possible unless the sender or recipient knows the switchover points in their respective parts of the onion. This would prevent nodes from creating unbounded path lengths and sidestepping the 20 hop limit, which could lead to null-routing attacks.ZmnSCPxj suggested using packet switching as a way to route payments through multiple channels, allowing for more anonymity and increasing the network's capacity. This method involves using onion packets with different packet types, such as identifying the next node by node-id or using ephemeral key switching. It also allows for uncertainty about the destination and can justify multiple features having a single feature bit. Mapless Lightning nodes could ask a peer to be their pathfinding provider, but there is some uncertainty involved as the destination specified may not be the final destination.Additionally, Andrew Poelstra noted that if spontaneous ephemeral key switches were possible while forwarding a payment, it could allow nodes to create unbounded path lengths and sidestep the 20 hop limit altogether by controlling multiple nodes in a route. This would be undesirable for many reasons, including the ability to further amplify null-routing attacks. Poelstra also noted that additional funds would be locked up each time you route through yourself, even if the routing is circular.</summary>
