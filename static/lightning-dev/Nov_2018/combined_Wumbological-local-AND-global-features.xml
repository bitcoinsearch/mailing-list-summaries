    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, ZmnSCPxj proposed that wumbo channels should also allow for wumbo payments. This would be especially useful if the bit is signaled globally and would indicate the willingness of nodes to forward larger payments up to their max_htlc limit within the channel_update for that link. However, Laolu pointed out an inconsistency in the newer-ish section of the spec concerning the optional max_htlc value. The value should be below the max capacity of the channel but makes no reference to the current (pre-wumbo) _max HTLC limit_. As a result, one may interpret signaling of the optional field as eligibility to route wumbo payments in a pre-wumbo channel world. ZmnSCPxj also noted that much of the wumbo payments would be implemented by AMP. If there is no direct path of wumborama nodes from payer to payee, then wumbo payments will have to be done by AMP. It would be nice if we could have AMP merge into intermediate nodes instead of always at the destination, so that only the suffix of the path needs to be wumborama. A proposal has been put forward on the Lightning-dev platform by ZmnSCPxj to add two feature bits to the Lightning Network protocol. The first feature bit, `option_i_wumbo_you_wumbo`, would indicate that a node is willing to "wumbo" with its counterpart in a connection. The second feature bit, `option_anyone_can_wumbo`, would indicate that the node is willing to wumbo with any other node. Rusty Russell chimed in with a suggestion to name `option_anyone_can_wumbo` to `option_wumborama`. The primary reasoning for limited channel sizes is the risk associated with new software, but with the development of new features, it may be time to consider allowing for more limitations to wumbo. To address this concern, the proposal suggests creating a whitelist of node pubkeys that the node owner considers safe to accept making wumbo channels with. Additionally, reckless users could set an option in the software to be willing to wumbo with any node.A node must set the local feature bit if it sets the global feature bit in its announcement and may clear the global feature bit even if it sends a set `option_i_wumbo_you_wumbo` to its peer. Additionally, a node may report different values for `option_i_wumbo_you_wumbo` to different nodes. If a node did not set the `option_i_wumbo_you_wumbo` feature bit reported to its counterparty, it must respond with an `error` if it receives an `open_channel` with a `funding_satoshis` value beyond the indicated limit for the chain. The discussion focused on how to ensure that wumbo channels and payments are properly implemented and how to address any inconsistencies in the spec.</summary>
