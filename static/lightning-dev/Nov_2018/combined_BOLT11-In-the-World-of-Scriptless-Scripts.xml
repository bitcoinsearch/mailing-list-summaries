    <summary>The Lightning Network community has been discussing the future of payment flows in the network. Rusty Russell, one of the original developers of Bitcoin's Lightning Network, proposed using secp256k1 public/private keys for payment hashes/preimages as an optional feature in version 1.1 of the lightning spec. This proposal would enable payment decorrelation, Atomic Multi-Path (AMP), and third-party verifiable proof-of-payment. Russell also suggested that invoices should be able to be paid multiple times by different individuals to prevent fraud. He proposed a mechanism for AMP splits and joins.In other discussions on the Lightning-Dev mailing list, Anthony Towns proposed adding optional support for using secp256k1 public/private keys for payment hashes/preimages. However, Rusty Russell raised concerns about continuous paths of channels with the same feature being needed. The discussion also covered the possibility of generating multiple nonces R=r*G values from n*32B worth of random data and the four types of "proof of payment" people might desire: deniable payments, shared secret, signed payment, and third-party verifiable payment.Furthermore, the discussion explored the possibility of source-directed splits and joins, which is deemed impractical, and including URLs was dismissed due to its unsigned externality and poor privacy properties. In addition, Rusty noted that payment splitting and joining could be possible if instructions on how to do it were encoded in the onion message. Finally, scriptless scripts were suggested as a possible solution to the issue of safe invoice reuse.The email conversation between Rusty Russell and Jonas Nick discusses a proposed scheme for Schnorr signatures for Lightning Network. The proposal aims to enable recurrent payments and integrate Atomic Multi-Path Payments (AMP) into the scheme, but there are challenges with adding a nonce to allow for AMP since R already acts as a unique nonce under the hash. The conversation also delves into different levels of payment on the Lightning Network, such as low AMP, multiple payments with the same hash, and high AMP. In a recent email correspondence on the Lightning-Dev mailing list, Rusty Russell discussed what the lightning payment flow might look like in the future. He suggested that v1.1 of the Lightning Network specification should include experimental/optional support for using secp256k1 public/private keys for payment hashes/preimages. However, he acknowledged that since every intermediary needs to support it, considerable buy-in would be required before committing to it in 1.1. Russell outlined several components that would need to be included, such as invoices and channel announcements that support both sha256 and secp256k1 preimages.The email thread discusses the technicalities of payments made through Lightning Network. The discussion revolves around proving payment and delivering goods in exchange. They discuss how only the payee and payer know the payment preimage q (Q=qG). Later, ZmnSCPxj suggests using revocable invoices to purchase items from Lizard Master Rusty, which involves two secrets: a payment-proof-secret known initially by Rusty and a revocation-secret known initially by the buyer. The discussion ends with the idea that higher levels can be created on top of Lightning for such exchanges.</summary>
