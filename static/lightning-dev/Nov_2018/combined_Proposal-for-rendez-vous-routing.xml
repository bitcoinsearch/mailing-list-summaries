    <summary>The Lightning network is facing concerns that powerful participants may enforce KYC requirements on Lightning nodes, leading to a split in the network. Private channels are a countermeasure, but their existence must be known to payers who need to cross the gap between compliant and non-compliant parts of the network, risking penalties for node owners on the compliant side. Rendezvous routing may offer a better solution where the payee chooses one or more routes from certain third-party nodes in the network and passes sphinx-encrypted blobs for those routes to the payer. ZmnSCPxj suggests that the rest of the network should punish any participant enforcing KYC requirements by closing any channel to it and doing retaliatory preemptive closing of any channel to any participant publicly connecting, directly or indirectly, to that participant.  Rusty Russell proposes a "merchant forward" service design where Alice can remain anonymous from the lightning network by using Bob's forwarding service. However, CJP raises concerns about the proposal since Bob could be excluded from the side of the network with the more harsh regulatory conditions. The minor downside of Rusty's merchant forward service design is that Bob can issue invoices as Alice since invoice keys are conflated with onion keys.CJP points out that BOLT 4 assumes source routing and has a shared secret between hop and source. However, it may be possible to use rendezvous routing and only provide the blinding key. In conclusion, while there are concerns regarding KYC requirements being enforced on Lightning nodes, solutions like private channels, rendezvous routing, and merchant forward services are being explored to maintain anonymity and decentralization in the network.</summary>
