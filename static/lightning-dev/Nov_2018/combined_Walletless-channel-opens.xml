    <summary>The Lightning Development Summit 2018 will not discuss SIGHASH_NOINPUT as it is out of scope, but it is an interesting topic for future consideration. The use of SIGHASH_NOINPUT could make Lightning implementations "walletless" by reducing the need for specific wallet implementations during channel opening protocols. This would also reduce implementation complexity and the number of transactions needed. However, a user on the Lightning-dev mailing list pointed out that committing to transaction fees for delayed-broadcast transactions would be necessary without a wallet, which could lead to high fees for open channels that need to be closed quickly to prevent fraud. In an email exchange between David A. Harding and ZmnSCPxj, they discussed the possibility of better integrating onchain wallets with protocols that delay between signing and broadcast.</summary>
