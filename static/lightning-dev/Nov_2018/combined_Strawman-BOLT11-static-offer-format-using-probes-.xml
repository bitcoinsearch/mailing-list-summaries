    <summary>In an email exchange, René Pickhardt asked Rusty Russell for clarification on the term "lightning probe message" and suggested having a connection-oriented communication layer on top of the current protocol to allow for more efficient payment communication. Rusty responded by recommending reading the paper on HORNET and explaining the lack of incentives as well as privacy concerns.ZmnSCPxj proposed using a mechanism of generating a payment hash from random data and sending it to the payee to stream invoices instead of anime. He also proposed adding separate BOLT15 offers that let users get any number of BOLT11 invoices, and suggested including a connection-oriented communication layer on top of the current protocol to allow for more efficient payment communication. However, ZmnSCPxj believes that payments or forwarding fees should be attached to each such message due to concerns over abuse of network capacity.The proposal suggests having reusable BOLT11 "offers" that provide almost-spontaneous payments without generating a BOLT11 invoice for each potential sale. The offer will have a `p` field of 26 bytes, which is ignored by existing nodes. The payer will use a new lightning probe message using the current onion format for HTLCs to retrieve the complete invoice.ZmnSCPxj admitted to overestimating the power of Scriptless Scripts before the summit, but now recognizes that SS is indeed powerful, albeit difficult to implement without Schnorr. This difficulty arises due to script magic with `OP_CODESEPARATOR`, which led to the idea of waiting for Schnorr instead.During a conversation on the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list, user ZmnSCPxj apologized for not fully fleshing out the power of Scriptless Scripts before the summit. Another user commented that their understanding was that Scriptless Scripts were as powerful as they thought, at least for some applications. However, implementing Scriptless Scripts is difficult without Schnorr due to script magic with OP_CODESEPARATOR, and progress has been stalled in anticipation of Schnorr. Rusty clarified that static invoices are not possible without an extra interaction.ZmnSCPxj also proposed a new method of having reusable BOLT11 "offers" that provide almost-spontaneous payments without generating a BOLT11 invoice for each potential sale and suggested making a new BOLT document for how to generate a BOLT11 invoice. He also raised a concern regarding the canonical ordering for tagged fields in the generated bolt11 invoice and suggested a proposal for types to have an absolute order, which would be useful for unique parts of something.</summary>
