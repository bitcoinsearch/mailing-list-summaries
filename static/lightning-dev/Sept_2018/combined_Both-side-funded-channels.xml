    <summary>Discussions surrounding the implementation of both-side funding channels in the Lightning Network have been taking place. This would allow both parties to contribute funds to a channel at the same time in a single transaction, potentially improving the network's growth. However, concerns over privacy and locked funds have been raised, as well as potential attack vectors. To mitigate these concerns, the initiator of a dual-sided channel would be required to pay a fee based on capacity requested from the initiatee. Conversations have also explored an alternate solution to the issue of incoming capacity, namely off-to-onchain swaps. This allows for funds to be moved back on-chain in exchange for slightly higher fees, potentially providing more incoming capacity. While some suggest that dual-funded channels may not be necessary given the requirement for the initiator to put up funds anyway, others believe it is important to homogenize the network by having every node support incoming dual-funding requests if it has on-chain capacity to improve decentralization and privacy.The topics of discussion have included the weaknesses of using Lightning Network (LN) as a means of receiving funds, with the current method requiring merchants to possess all funds they wish to receive, taking longer, and requiring two on-chain transactions. However, people who consistently keep their node online for a few months typically receive incoming capacity anyway. Additionally, a proposal has been made to automate the negotiation process and support both-side funding channels widely to ease the job of autopilots. Overall, the implementation of dual-funded channels in the Lightning Network is being discussed and will require further hashing out at the November lightning-dev summit. It is noted that while implementation could take over a year, the alternate solution of off-to-onchain swaps can theoretically be implemented now and repeated until enough incoming capacity is obtained.</summary>
