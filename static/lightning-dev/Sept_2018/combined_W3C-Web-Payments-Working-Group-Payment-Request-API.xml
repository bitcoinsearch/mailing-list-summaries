    <summary>A member of the Lightning-dev community has asked about companies being members of W3C and if anyone could be a member of the W3C Web Payments Working Group. Christian Decker is mentioned as a member in a previous email. The W3C has released their candidate recommendation for a payment API, which includes Bitcoin but could also be compatible with Lightning payments. The W3C Web Payments Working Group is discussing the compatibility of Bitcoin and Lightning with the proposed Payment Request API and progress is being tracked on their GitHub page. Christian Decker is closely following the discussion to determine what changes and special considerations are needed for Bitcoin and Lightning to work correctly when the spec is finalized and deployed. A special Payment Method ID needs to be assigned to them since they cannot rely on a centralized URL to act as a payment method. The Payment Request API even mentions XBT as a supported currency, in addition to ISO4217 codes. Special handling is required for Bitcoin and Lightning with regard to the Payment Method, therefore, the Payment Method Manifest doesn't apply to them. This suggests that Bitcoin and Lightning should work with the spec without any major roadblocks.The W3C Web Payments Working Group is looking for feedback on their GitHub repository as there are multiple ways to propose a payment method. A local handler can also be specified as a Payment Handler, allowing for a Bitcoin or Lightning daemon running locally that is invoked for payment requests. In conclusion, the W3C Web Payments Working Group is discussing the compatibility of Bitcoin and Lightning with the proposed Payment Request API, and Christian Decker is closely following the discussion to ensure that the spec is compatible with both cryptocurrencies.</summary>
