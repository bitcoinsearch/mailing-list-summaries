    <summary>The use of chain_id to differentiate between blockchains based on the hash of their genesis block has been questioned, given the existence of hardforks branching off of the Bitcoin blockchain. This has led to discussions about how Lightning can function on or across permanent forks of a parent blockchain that share the same genesis block. Suggestions have been made to change the definition of chain_id to the hash of the first block of the new branch and require replay and wipe-out protection, but concerns have been raised about whether these requirements can be relaxed. The complications of open channels during a fork and the potential loss of funds if replay protection is not implemented have also been discussed.Christian Decker and Rusty Russell have discussed using the first forked block as the genesis block for a forkchain, while keeping the non-forked blockchain on the original genesis hash to avoid disruption. However, they also mention the difficulty that arises if one chain does not declare itself as the forked chain. The discussion then shifts to channels that are open during the fork and how to settle them. If no replay protection was implemented on the fork, then the last commitment can be used to close the channel, but if replay protection was implemented, then people will lose money. Rusty also mentions the possibility of a standalone "salvage" utility to retrieve lost funds.There has been no prior discussion or study of Lightning in the setting of hardforks, and it is unclear if this is the appropriate place for such discussions. Martin, the author of the message, seeks input and guidance on these issues. The email exchange concludes with Christian welcoming Martin to the mailing list and expressing his excitement for the upcoming challenges.</summary>
