    <summary>Andy Schroder has been discussing with Rusty Russell the feasibility of implementing micro-payments using Lightning. They have noted that for high-value products that require quick delivery, micro-payments are not possible. Schroder is attempting to adapt his fuel pump to use Lightning and requires a refund address due to pre-payment requirements. Russell suggests adding a flag in BOLT 11 to indicate a refund address is needed, with the refund information added to the payment onion itself. The limitations of privacy with lightning payments are also discussed, with Schroder asking how payees distinguish payments from different payers when using BOLT 11, and the purpose of the p tagged field. In an email exchange, Rusty Russell and Christian Decker discuss the possibility of paying the same payment request twice with version 1.1 of Lightning, which may change the way payment hashes work. They also discuss allowing for amount adjustments while the payment has not been resolved, enabling incremental payments from sender to recipient. This approach could allow for payments similar to simple Spillman-style payment channels.Schroder also questions whether real-time micro-payments would be feasible for automobiles, and whether there could be automatic failover routes in case one of the hops goes down during delivery. Despite these concerns, the writer believes that there are many other use cases where a refund may be desired, hence the inclusion of a refund address option in BIP 70.</summary>
