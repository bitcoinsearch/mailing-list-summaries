    <summary>Lightning Network has developed a 2-of-3 party escrow system that allows for a third-party mediator to verify payments for goods and services. The system requires two of the three parties to agree on the transaction before the HTLC (hashed timelocked contract) is fulfilled. The sender and receiver can authorise payment in most cases where there is cooperation. The proposed HTLC wire message determines the type of resolution states, which include recipient paid, sender refunded via timeout, and payment immediately cancelled with sender refunded. Joseph Poon explains that this system is functionally the same as the use case for on-chain "2-of-3 multisig" escrow systems without the 3rd party escrow being a custodian for any funds. This is useful for payments for goods and services which need a third-party mediator. As Lightning uses Bitcoin transactions and scripts using Bitcoins, it will be possible to do nearly instant offchain multisig "escrow" on decentralized Lightning. From an inter-node transport perspective, all that matters is how many values per contract. It's up to the sender and receiver to agree on an escrow agent, figure out how to communicate with them, etc. The author congratulated Tadge, Laolu, and Joseph for their work on Lightning and plans to wade through this week and try to create a list of wire protocol differences to get closer to a final version.</summary>
