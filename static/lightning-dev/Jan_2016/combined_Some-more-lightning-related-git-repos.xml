    <summary>Today, the -wizards IRC channel revealed two unreviewed repositories that Bryan hasn't checked for quality, security, or functionality. The links to these repos are https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lnd and https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lightning-onion. Along with these, Bryan shared links to other git repositories containing related work such as https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning and https://github.com/matsjj/thundernetwork. However, Bryan did not offer any insight into the status of these repositories. Meanwhile, ACINQ has released a new scala implementation of "deployable lightning" on Github. This implementation is designed to have an actor per lightning channel and keep everything non-blocking, allowing it to be fully compatible with Rusty&amp;aj's implementation. It also uses the same protobuf messages and state machine as Rusty&amp;aj's implementation. Furthermore, there is some prototyping on the soon-to-be-replaced onion routing.In addition, Bryan Bishop shared several other related git repositories on the Lightning-dev mailing list, including lnd, lightning-onion, lightning, and thundernetwork. However, he has not reviewed any of the source code for quality, security, or functionality. Despite this, Pierre expressed his excitement for an agreement on the wire protocol. Bryan's contact details have been provided at http://heybryan.org/ and 1 512 203 0507, making it easy to reach out to him for further information.</summary>
