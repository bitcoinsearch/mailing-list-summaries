    <summary>The email exchange between Rusty Russell and AJ discusses shachain vs elkrem, R value vs keypair, and multi-sig transactions. They also talk about the structure of the tree and how to compute it. AJ prefers Rusty's construction as it is more straightforward to understand. They also discuss using a simple secret "redeemhash" to trace transactions through the network and implementing escrow-style services by allowing more than one hash on commit transactions. However, AJ points out that the proposal was to support 2-of-3 hashes, which is slightly more complicated than just multiple hashes. Finally, they conclude with some technical details regarding the indexing in shachain and elkrem.</summary>
