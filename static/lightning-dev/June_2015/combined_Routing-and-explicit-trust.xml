    <summary>On June 23, 2015, Rusty Russell engaged in email conversations with two different people. In one conversation, a person named Benjamin had questions about the terms "channel counterparty" and "clearinghouse" mentioned in a paper. Rusty explained the terms and also talked about how payment can be delayed or flushed to the blockchain. Benjamin also asked about how users could find and select intermediaries, which Rusty stated was an open question that he plans to discuss with CJP, the author of Amiko pay.In another conversation, a user named "sickpig at gmail.com" asked Rusty if they were already on a new list. Rusty confirmed that the user was one of the early subscribers and welcomed them. However, he noted that there were only 15 subscribers at the time and he planned to wait before starting any real discussions. In this context, it is unclear what the purpose of the new list was, but it can be assumed that it was related to Amiko pay. The paper being discussed raises questions about the risks associated with "channel counterparties" and "clearinghouses" and why routing through them would be trustless. While building trust-based level 2 protocols is a good idea, it may not work without explicit trust. The existing banking system allows for minimizing counterparty risk by shifting unwanted exposures, but systematic risk can still pose a threat. If counterparties are interconnected, failures can propagate in unexpected ways.</summary>
