    <summary>The Tor Project has announced that it will be dropping support for v2 hidden services in its latest release, with the aim of entirely dropping it from all supported releases by October. Bitcoin Core has already dropped support for v2 and plans to drop the v2 support for 0.22. This means that v2 onions will gradually stop being gossiped on the Bitcoin network. C-lightning is also deprecating the configuration of Tor v2 services starting next release, with its support expected to be dropped three releases after that. While other implementations of the Lightning network have not yet shared their plans for Tor v2 support, the Lightning Network daemon (lnd) is planning to disallow users from creating v2 onion service in its next major release and may upgrade them to v3 onion service if their node supports it. It should be noted that Tor is a centralized system, so when they drop v2 support, v2 hidden services will stop working on the Tor network. Therefore, it is pointless to keep supporting v2 hidden services beyond Tor's stated deadlines. Recent logs reveal that some newer Tor clients are refusing to connect to v2 onion services. A na√Øve script was run to determine how much of the network uses Tor, and 8793 out of 12844 nodes were found to use Tor. Only around 60 v2 addresses seem to be advertised on the network, so this change should not cause much disruption. Over half of all advertised addresses on the network are now onion services, which could affect payment latency, connection stability, and gossip announcement propagation.At the spec level, it is suggested to advise implementations to ignore the v2 addr type in the node_announcement message's addrs section. The author suggests that the Lightning network should follow suit and drop support for v2 hidden services. However, the author notes that the configuration is user-facing, which could make the transition trickier. The Lightning Network daemon (lnd) is planning to disallow users from creating v2 onion service in its next major release and may upgrade them to v3 onion service if their node supports it.</summary>
