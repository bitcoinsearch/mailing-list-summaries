    <summary>Ole Henrik Skogstrøm and Laolu's email conversation discuss a method of opening balanced channels between nodes or in a ring using LND's psbt option. Joining funded PSBTs before signing and submitting them allows for the creation of a balanced channel. This process can be made easier by using the 'balanceofsatoshis' tool, but caution must be taken as lnd only locks the UTXOs allocated for funding attempts for a few minutes. Lightning Pool uses this method to purchase 50/50 balanced channels and buy channel leases for third-party users.The email includes an example of the complete flow for opening a single channel as well as a ring of channels between multiple nodes. The process involves collaboration between nodes by sending PSBTs back and forth to each other. While manual collaboration is possible, automating the process through a client would be more efficient.It's essential to note that the balanced-ness of a channel is temporary, and opening channels in this manner only allows them to start in a balanced state. If fees and channel policies aren't set accordingly, a normal payment or balance flow could shift the channel away from equilibrium shortly after opening. This process can be automatically batched with other channels created in that epoch and use traits of the Pool account system to make things atomic.</summary>
