    <summary>In an email exchange on September 1, 2021, a user named ZmnSCPxj cautioned against accepting the premise that a proposed algorithm is "optimal." The algorithm in question was deemed optimal under a specific heuristic used to approximate what the user wants. However, in reality, there are a lot of different factors to consider such as CLTV, fees, and estimated failure probability calculated from node online percentages at-open liquidity.To balance all these factors into a score that can be fed into a routing algorithm, heuristics are used. However, there is no guarantee of convergence to a single solution, which may lead to nonconstructive disagreement between LN developers in the future. This approach may make the job of node operators less predictable and be perceived as a loss of decentralization to the developers. Despite this, some argue that users should be able to solve an NP-hard problem if necessary, similar to how the program "apt-get install" solves an NP-hard problem every time it runs.ZmnSCPxj suggested translating all these factors to a single unit such as millisatoshi, which is already being done in practice. However, this involves some heuristics on the part of the application developer. There is no one-size-fits-all solution for balancing competing costs, and different designs may lead to different score units. Thus, neither approach can be provably better than the other.</summary>
