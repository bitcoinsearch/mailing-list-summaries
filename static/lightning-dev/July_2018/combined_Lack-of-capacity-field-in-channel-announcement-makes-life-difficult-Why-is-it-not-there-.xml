    <summary>The absence of channel capacity in the channel_announcement message is problematic for mobile and light wallets, as they cannot determine it without checking the blockchain. This leads to lower routing success rates for larger payments and increases the complexity of route-finding tools. Robert Olsson proposed adding an HTLC maximum value to channel_update, but Christian Decker clarified that the focus should be on adding the total channel capacity to the channel_announcement. This would save an on-chain lookup and could be useful for fresh pruned nodes. However, there are concerns about potential abuse and bandwidth issues.To address this issue, one user suggested appending an htlc_maximum_msat value to the channel_update message, which would show capacity minus fees. Christian Decker responded by stating that he thinks it would be better and more flexible to append a max to channel_update. Nonetheless, he agrees with the addition of total channel capacity to channel_announcement and believes it should get its own proposal and discussion.Christian Decker suggests that discussions about different proposals should be judged independently and not grouped together for convenience. Rusty proposes introducing an optional funding transaction and merkle proof to channel_announce or a new channel_announce_with_proof message, which nodes could use a feature bit to indicate whether they want. He also suggests tunneling bitcoin block headers through the network to benefit lite nodes.</summary>
