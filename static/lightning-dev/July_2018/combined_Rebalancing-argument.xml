    <summary>The Lightning Network has been a topic of discussion for many researchers and developers with regards to re-balancing the network. Active rebalancing becomes necessary when a node wishes to receive payment, but the channels they have available do not have enough capacity. Pre-AMP, active rebalancing was necessary to ensure that nodes could receive payments, but post-AMP, multi-path payments make it less necessary. Passive rebalancing can also help reduce the number of routing failures from failed HTLC forwarding, but the directionality of payment flows in the network can determine whether passive rebalancing is necessary or not. Some researchers argue that maintaining balance in the network may not necessarily affect network liquidity, and a smart fee strategy might be more effective in balancing the network than sending cycle transactions. Rene Pickhardt suggests Atomic Multipath Payments and splicing as potential solutions to rebalancing issues and notes that routing fees in the Lightning Network would require a new approach to mathematical analysis. The use of Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) affects the flow of the network by locking up funds while routing takes place.Dmytro Piatkivskyi suggests that cheaper fees or shorter paths can be achieved through a smart fee strategy without the need for re-balancing. Additionally, he notes that the distribution of funds in channels may not have a significant impact on network liquidity. However, Rene Pickhardt points out that routing fees in the Lightning network invalidate the theorem and lemma quoted by Dmytro. Finally, the conversation between Dmytro and Olaoluwa suggests that active rebalancing may be necessary for nodes to send/receive payments themselves, while passive rebalancing can be carried out independently of needing to send/receive payments to ensure an equilibrium state amongst the available balances of their channels.</summary>
