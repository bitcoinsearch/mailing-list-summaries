    <summary>The email thread revolves around the use of sighash_noinput that helps in reducing the number of stored signatures. The method is being questioned for its potential trade-off of privacy in the case of watchtowers. Eltoo is mentioned as it requires SIGHASH_NOINPUT, which allows only the latest transaction to be needed instead of a penalty tx for every state change. However, it does not scale well as it requires one blob per outsourced state. With the reuse of signatures for multiple states with sighash_noinput, there is a question of how to minimize information being disclosed to third parties. Although no full design has been done yet, encryption using the txid is suggested as a possible solution. A twist is that the watchtower may need to consider transactions that have already been spent by one or a chain of SIGHASH_NOINPUT transactions, but this is considered easy. Rusty Russell responds by stating that a wallet should never create a SIGHASH_NOINPUT to spend its own UTXOs, as it is only useful for smart contracts with unique conditions such as lightning.</summary>
