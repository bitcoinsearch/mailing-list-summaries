    <summary>Praveen Baratam has expressed confusion over the possibility of patenting Second Level Protocols like Lightning Network. However, it is unlikely that these protocols can be patented in the EU as both mathematical methods and computer programs are excluded from being patented. The patent system grants a state monopoly on the construction and sale of an invention in exchange for complete revelation of the design by the inventor. Prior art applies to items already known among practitioners, so there is no need for a monopoly. The grace period allows an inventor to publish the design of an invention and then file for a patent afterward, but this period is not unlimited and the USA provides a grace period of only 1 year. The current Lightning design is based on the prior-art Poon-Dryja paper, which has been publicly designed and continuously published in the lightning-rfc. Neither Poon nor Dryja have applied for patents within a year of publication, making it unlikely that the inventors of Lightning will be granted a patent. It should be noted that agents operating patent systems may not operate ideally due to external corrupting influences.</summary>
