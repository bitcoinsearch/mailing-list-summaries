    <summary>The Lightning Network implementation teams have announced a new update mechanism called eltoo, which is a drop-in replacement for the penalty-based invalidation mechanism currently used. Eltoo simplifies the process of estimating fees ahead of time and allows for the attachment of fees when settling, as well as bumping using CPFP or RBF. Before implementing eltoo, a minor change to Bitcoin is required: the introduction of the SIGHASH_NOINPUT flag for signatures. A formal proposal may now be found in the eltoo paper, which invites the community to consider and discuss the proposal.In discussions on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, AJ Towns proposed using eltoo as a replacement for the penalty-based invalidation mechanism used in the Lightning Network specification. The proposed transaction scheme has several features such as txes at (3a) and (3b) can both pay current market fees with minimal risk and can be CPFPed by a tx spending your own channel balance. The paper discusses the use of SIGHASH_NOINPUT in combination with SIGHASH_SINGLE for off-chain transactions. Settlement transactions can carry contracts, which will be affected by the CSV-encumberance of the settlement transaction. Compared to Poon-Dryja (LN-penalty) channels, this approach requires more transactions in the worst-case, but dropping unilaterally on-chain requires the party doing the drop to have some on-chain funds it controls completely, since update transactions do not pay fees by themselves.Christian Decker proposed a new mechanism called 'eltoo' as a drop-in replacement for the penalty based invalidation mechanism used in the Lightning specification. AJ suggested that if there were more than 1B updates to a channel, one could reset the locktime by rolling over to use new update keys. Dave, a reader of Eltoo's paper, asked for clarification on one point, which was responded with a suggestion to monitor old states until they have sufficient confirmations to make them immutable. Christian and Dave discussed the possibility of S_2 making it into the blockchain, but S_3 is immediately bound to it so that it doesn't have any effect except for wasting some fees. ZmnSCPxj has proposed to remove the trigger transaction as `nSequence`-encumbered transactions are only settlement transactions and not any update transactions.One issue with eltoo's locktime-based sequencing is that it limits the number of updates to 1 billion. However, ZmnSCPxj suggests an adaptive scheme in which a second update transaction is added at around 90% of the available range. Christian Decker notes that he did not think 1 billion updates would be used anytime soon since splice-in/splice-out operations would lead to regular on-chain re-anchoring. David A. Harding raised a question about the certainty of the last agreed-upon state not being replaced. Christian Decker clarified that while it is true that the last agreed-upon state can be replaced in the mempool by paying more fees, it can be ensured that this update doesn't have any effect by binding the next agreed-upon state to it immediately afterward.A potential vulnerability in the Lightning Network's Eltoo protocol has been discovered by Bitcoin developer David A. Harding. This involves an attacker stalling a payment channel so long that the transactional fees required to complete it are higher than the value of the channel. In a post to the lightning-dev mailing list, David A. Harding shared his thoughts on several potential denial-of-service (DoS) attacks against Lightning Network settlements with regards to issues with relative locktime and SIGHASH_NOINPUT.In an email exchange between Christian Decker and Carsten Strotmann, they discuss the creation of a setup transaction in Bitcoin's Script language. In another email exchange, the terminology used in the eltoo paper was discussed. In this email exchange, Christian and ZmnSCPxj discuss the impact of CSV-encumberance on settlement transactions that carry contracts in the channel.Carsten Otto raised questions regarding a paper's confusing description of the setup transaction. He mentioned that there was a mix-up between the terms "setup transaction" and "funding transaction", which were both referred to as T_{u,0} without showing them in the diagrams.Anthony Towns proposed that if you have more than 1B updates to your channel, you could reset the locktime by rolling over to use new update keys. Christian Decker proposed an adaptive scheme for update transactions in the Lightning specification, which starts with a single transaction and adds a second at around 90% of the available range. ZmnSCPxj suggested always having two update transactions, which would create a single counter with 10^18 possible updates.</summary>
