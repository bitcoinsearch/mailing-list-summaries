    <summary>The Lightning Network is discussing the possibility of a single-funder anchor without requiring new sighash ops nor losing outsourcability. Funds can be transferred through the lightning network or via atomic cross-blockchain idea. The proposal has an asymmetric risk where either side could abort with no penalty and make the other side wait for the escape timeout anyway. Incentives for channel creation are tied with routing, and not immediately clear.The soft fork process is currently undergoing significant changes, causing a backlog in the system. Additionally, there were already major concerns about the process before these changes. The version bits BIP remains in progress and the BIP66 fork revealed further problems with the process. Meanwhile, the block size hard fork remains a contentious issue. Rusty Russell made a statement that it takes twice the time to get a full two-way channel but was corrected by go1111111 who pointed out that the atomic swap tx can hit the bitcoin blockchain about the same time as the anchor tx.In a discussion on the Lightning Network mailing list, Rusty Russell and Joseph Poon discuss the dual-anchor proposal for the network. Russell notes that asymmetric risk is not necessarily a problem with this proposal, as either party could abort the transaction without penalty. Poon suggested an alternative model without BIP62. They also discussed using OP_CSV or OP_CLTV for time-locked transactions.In a post by Joseph Poon, it was mentioned that OP_CSV still requires BIP 62. However, a model can be constructed with OP_CLTV without BIP 62 using single-funder with some OP_CLTV'd output. There seem to be no objections to assuming BIP62 at this stage, but it is good to know that there is a backup if that proves overly optimistic.</summary>
