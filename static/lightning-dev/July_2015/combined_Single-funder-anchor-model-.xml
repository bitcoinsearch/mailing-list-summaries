    <summary>The soft fork process is going through significant changes, leading to a backlog in the system. The version bits BIP for multiple concurrent soft forks is still in progress and the BIP66 fork exposed more issues. The block size hard fork remains contentious. In an email exchange, Rusty Russell expressed contentment with assuming BIP62 for OP_CSV, while Joseph Poon suggested an alternative model without BIP62. A correction was made on a thread found on bitcointalk.org regarding Rusty Russell's statement that it takes twice the time to get a full two-way channel. They discussed the dual-anchor proposal for the Lightning Network on its mailing list and concluded that asymmetric risk is not an issue, as either party could abort the transaction without penalty. They also discussed using OP_CSV or OP_CLTV for time-locked transactions, but note that BIP 62 is required for OP_CSV, while Poon suggested a model can be constructed using OP_CLTV without BIP 62.In a post by Joseph Poon, it was mentioned that OP_CSV still requires BIP 62, but a model can be constructed with OP_CLTV without BIP 62. A recent discussion on #lightning-dev pointed out that a single-funder anchor can be done without requiring new sighash ops nor losing outsourcability. The dual-anchor proposal features an asymmetric risk where either side could abort with no penalty and make the other side wait for the escape timeout anyway. They noted that incentives for channel creation are tied with routing and not immediately clear.</summary>
