    <summary>Mats Jerratsch is developing a Lightning Implementation Client/Server in Java, using bitcoinj as the framework. He had an implementation ready but discarded it after reading Rusty's paper, as it had trust dependencies and channel transactions were highly asynchronous, making an LN-Network impossible. Rusty's solution allowed channels to be open indefinitely, unlike Mats' implementation. The delay for the 'HTLC Receiver Redeemscript' was also noticed, which could enable the receiver to claim outputs instantly. Rusty suggested delaying any output condition that pays to "self" to mitigate this. Furthermore, he rewrote his test-cli utils to support dual anchors. Mats praises Rusty's work and plans to push his implementation into GitHub soon, after making necessary changes.</summary>
