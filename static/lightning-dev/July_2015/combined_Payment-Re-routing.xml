    <summary>The Lightning Network is a payment channel that allows for fast and cheap transactions on the Bitcoin network. However, there are concerns about the security of the network when rerouting payments.In an email exchange between Stephen Morse and Rusty Russell, the issue of a potential failure mode in the A -&gt; C -&gt; E payment channel was discussed. The concern was that if C became unresponsive, C could collude with another party to steal funds.Joseph Poon suggested a solution off-list, which involved E routing a conditional refund back to A with a larger timeout via a different route. This would pay back the amount to A if they presented the preimage for the initial stalled payment and another preimage only A had. However, this solution raises questions about how nodes get paid and whether A can provide evidence that the route had timed out.To fix this issue, C could obtain a refund from E if they know they have been offline for longer than B's willingness to wait before re-routing. One possible solution suggested by Stephen was to reroute only 99% of the payment while waiting for C to rejoin. Alternatively, if multiple paths are used, redistribute the remaining payments among the other functioning paths.The bigger problem here is that incentives are slightly skewed towards dishonesty. Breaking the payment into smaller chunks and across diverse paths can minimize the impact of dishonesty, but this approach results in reduced bandwidth and speed. A rating system could potentially be used to address this issue.There is no central processor to enforce node reputations in the Lightning Network, unlike Visa which kicks out banks that fail to meet their SLAs. To solve this issue, a set of authorities for directory nodes could open payment channels with all known lightning processors and use a protocol to periodically move money back and forth to verify connectivity. The Lightning network could benefit from the use of a system similar to Tor's nine "directory authorities" that record whether nodes in the network are available, vote among themselves to produce a directory consensus, and sign it. This would enable enforcement of the reputation of lightning nodes without requiring everyone to use the same directory authority.Nick ODell suggests that B could advertise its connected peers similar to BGP AS-Paths. Rusty then asks about the routing mechanism in the Lightning Network, indicating that it's worth discussing in a separate thread. Kevin Greene acknowledges Rusty's suggestion and decides to start a new thread on the topic.In conclusion, the Lightning Network has the potential for security issues when rerouting payments. Alternative solutions such as breaking up payments into smaller chunks and using a rating system based on node trustworthiness are proposed. The Lightning network could use a similar system to Tor's directory authority to verify connectivity. Further research may be necessary to determine the best course of action to prevent theft on the Lightning Network.</summary>
