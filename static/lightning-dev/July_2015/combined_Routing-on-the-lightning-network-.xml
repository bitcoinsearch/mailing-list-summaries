    <summary>The Lightning Network is a decentralized network that aims to provide fast and cheap transactions by creating payment channels between participants. In discussions about how routing will work in LN, Rusty Russell proposed an onion routing system where each node can only see the next hop, R hash, amount, timeout, and fee. However, this system requires source routing, which is a privacy disadvantage as it requires everyone to know the shape of the network.Rusty suggested supporting an opaque destination token to distinguish separate payments or separate clients. Routing tables serve as a heuristic to determine how likely a payment is to succeed on one's interfaces. The Lightning network's routing design has significant implications for privacy and enforcement of regulations. Without source routing, clients are left guessing the amount of fees to pay, leading to gaming and a poor model for privacy. However, with source routing and onion, it's possible to explicitly state what each hop gets.In a discussion about transaction fees, the author compares paying for internet access to the costs of transactions. They suggest that immediate per-transaction payment of fees is possible due to micro-transaction infrastructure, which could be advantageous but fees could play a role in routing decisions. The author suggests that fees could be used as a way to incentivize people to bring channels back to equilibrium. Negative fees could even be offered for transactions that bring a channel back to equilibrium.The author's "neutral meeting point" routing design is considered good enough; a node in the middle of the network advertises that it can benefit from a negative fee and invites people to perform transactions and share the profit. It creates two routable addresses: one for the negative-fee interface (A) and one for all other interfaces (B). Other people can then perform a payment-to-self with payee-side routing to A and payer-side routing to B.CJP emphasizes the importance of privacy and enforcement of regulations. They suggest de-coupling the function of "destination address of a route" from the function of "payer endpoint" or "payee endpoint" of a route. A powerful attacker could monitor transactions on several "regulated" nodes and gain the ability to initiate transactions from an "illegal" node that should have been censored.In an email exchange, Rusty Russell asks Joseph Poon if it's possible to rig a system that requires recipients to pay more depending on time. Joseph responds that it is possible and mentions an idea previously brought up by Tadge where the timelock could be used for decay of payments with one's counterparty for on-chain enforceability. He explains that with this system, commitments would have sub-commitments that pay out different lightning fee values with later locktimes.Overall, the discussion covers various aspects of transaction fees, routing models, and their advantages and disadvantages. The Lightning network's routing design plays a significant role in privacy and regulation enforcement, and there are different proposals to incentivize channel balance and prevent attacks.</summary>
