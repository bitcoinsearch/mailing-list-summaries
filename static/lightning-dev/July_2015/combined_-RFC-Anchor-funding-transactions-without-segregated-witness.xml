    <summary>Rusty Russell has proposed a basic lightning implementation that could theoretically be possible in real Bitcoin, but only after OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY soft-forks into it. The Commitment Transaction requires spending from the two inputs separately and the output would require having OP_CLTV or OP_CSV in the script output to determine whether a Commitment has been revoked. This construction will allow LN channels to exist with OP_CLTV; however, waiting until channel expiration would be required to get the money back. Rusty also revisited his ideas for establishing an anchor without new sighash modes, where signatures are traded on the first commitment transaction before signing the anchor transaction. To solve this problem, we can have two anchors instead of one, each requiring both our signatures to spend. Although there are three extra transactions involved, this technique works and doesn't add any new requirements.In an email exchange between Rusty Russell and Joseph Poon, they discussed the feasibility of implementing a basic lightning implementation in real bitcoin after OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY soft-forks into it. However, the malleability issue could cause the commitment transaction to be useless. Nevertheless, Rusty came up with another variant that Joseph approved of and improved upon. Rusty is currently writing up the final result.</summary>
