    <summary>The email thread discusses the development and deployment of the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP). There is a debate about the implementation of rules 2-7 in new blocks, with some members believing that these rules are non-standard while others argue that they are necessary to close vulnerabilities. Although BIP62 is not abandoned, there is no specific timeline for its deployment due to a soft-fork logjam. However, the uncontroversial aspects of BIP62 were hurriedly pushed out as BIP66 after an undisclosed vulnerability was discovered. Rusty Russell posted a draft proposal related to Lightning Network development called "ln-deploy-draft-01.pdf." The proposal includes the use of OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY which could make the deployment much quicker. Joseph Poon expressed his excitement about the proposal and stated that it would create a usable way to try out lightning on Bitcoin.Rusty Russell also shared a draft of his latest project called "ln-deploy" on ozlabs.org. The ln-node software simplifies the process of deploying LN nodes, which are essential for lightning-fast Bitcoin transactions. The LN is a layer-two scaling solution that allows for instant and low-cost transactions by creating payment channels between users.In the email conversation, concerns were raised about the deployment timeline for BIP62, but there is no timeline for it. BIP65: CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY has higher deployment priority than BIP62, and there is consensus on that. The developer also asked for specifics on BIP62 being out of date, as any issues identified would be fixed.</summary>
