    <summary>In a discussion about Bitcoin's HTLC outputs, Joseph Poon suggests storing the hash of the R value when dealing with long-dated HTLCs. He proposes using OP_RETURN metadata output to fit three outputs per transaction and suggests storing prior Commitment Transactions as a temporary solution for identifying HTLC outputs. The lightning protocol for network-level protocols is also explained, involving Alice and Bob updating their channel through signed commitment transactions. In another conversation, Rusty Russell suggests using a dummy output of "0: OP_RETURN 42" to prevent cheating in Bitcoin payments. He also proposes adding an extra output to deal with the difficulty of pay2scripthash HTLCs.Poon discusses the tradeoff between using OP_RETURN and local storage, with the former being preferable for large hubs. Additionally, he proposes overloading nLockTime with values below current unix-time for long-term use.In the world of blockchain technology, one important concept is the ability to embed metadata within a transaction. One such way to do this is through the OP_RETURN command, which allows for data to be stored within a Bitcoin transaction. However, there is a limit to how much data can be stored in each OP_RETURN output. Currently, only 80 bytes of data can be included in each output.To address this limitation, developers are working to find ways to fit more outputs per OP_RETURN metadata output. The goal is to increase the amount of information that can be stored within a single transaction, which could have significant implications for blockchain applications.By optimizing the use of OP_RETURN metadata outputs, developers could potentially increase the efficiency and usability of blockchain technology. This could lead to new use cases for blockchain, as well as improvements in existing applications. It will be interesting to see how this development progresses and what kind of impact it has on the wider blockchain ecosystem.</summary>
