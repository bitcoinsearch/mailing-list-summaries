    <summary>In August 2015, the Lightning Development mailing list saw several conversations about various aspects of the Lightning Network protocol. Rusty Russell discussed the need for a new sighash op mode or normalized txids for outsourcing, making it impractical to design and deploy a system around outsourcing currently. Meanwhile, Eric Lombrozo and Christopher Jamthagen discussed the possibility of stealing money from a hub and how to design a deployable system that would allow a third party to steal the money after the cheater signs and broadcasts their revoked commitment transaction. The group also discussed the timestop feature and its implementation for CLTV as well as CSV delay amount, scalability of outsourcability, and monitoring the blockchain for cheaters in LN.Another conversation between two individuals focused on a payment route and several issues related to it. One of the major issues raised was how Alice knows Bob and Carol, as Bitcoin requires an out-of-band key exchange but there is no ID attached to the keys. The discussion then delved into a specific payment route scenario where Alice wants to pay Carol some amount, and Carol gives Alice H(R). Alice updates her commitment tx with Bob, including the HTLC output, and Bob does the same with Carol. At this point, Carol withholds R, forcing Bob to broadcast the commitment tx between Bob and Carol, and Carol can spend the HTLC output because she knows R. Afterward, Alice refuses to update the commitment tx with Bob, putting a delay on Bob's ability to spend the HTLC output, but Alice can spend it if the CLTV has expired.A discussion was had between Christopher Jamthagen and Rusty regarding the timestop feature in Bitcoin's Lightning Network. Christopher proposed implementing the timestop feature for CLTV to make the difference between the number of blocks until either expiration the same in case of a block-filling attack. However, Rusty suggested that if the timestop feature were to activate only when the CLTV transaction is included in a block, it would allow for a potential DoS attack vector where hubs can be forced to close channels with other hubs. Rusty recommended explicitly supplying the block-height at which the transaction that includes the CLTV was signed to avoid this issue. He also suggested outsourcing for checking the blockchain and incentivizing miners to keep an extra eye out for cheaters on the blockchain. The outsourcing process would need a new sighash op mode or normalized txids, which makes it not something to design a deployable system around today, but Rusty believes outsourcability scales well and once you're full-time monitoring the blockchain, it's best to get as many clients as possible.</summary>
