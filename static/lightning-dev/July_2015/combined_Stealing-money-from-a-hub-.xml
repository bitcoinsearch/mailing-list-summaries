    <summary>In various email exchanges among individuals on the Lightning-dev mailing list, several topics related to the Lightning Network protocol were discussed. One topic concerned a potential vulnerability in which hubs could be forced to close channels with other hubs by having the attacker withhold R and create a block-filling attack. Another discussion centered around the timestop feature and how it should apply to both CSV and CLTV transactions. There were also talks about outsourcing blockchain checking for cheaters, although this would require a new sighash op mode or normalized txids. Another thread discussed the possibility of stealing money from a hub, which requires finding a way to pre-sign the stealing transaction for a third party.The conversation between two individuals revolves around a payment route and several issues related to it. One of the major issues discussed is how Alice knows Bob and Carol as there is no ID attached to the keys in Bitcoin. The concept of a hub seems to imply the use of standard PKI or Web-of-trust, both of which have big problems when it comes to large, frequent financial transactions. Incentives are also discussed as to why Bob should participate in this transaction.The discussion then delves into a specific payment route scenario where Alice wants to pay Carol some amount.Carol gives Alice H(R), and Alice updates her commitment tx with Bob, including the HTLC output. Bob does the same with Carol. At this point, Carol withholds R, forcing Bob to broadcast the commitment tx between Bob and Carol. Now, Carol can spend the HTLC output because she knows R, revealing it to the world. Alice now also refuses to update the commitment tx with Bob, forcing Bob to broadcast that commitment tx, putting a delay on Bob's ability to spend the HTLC output (as well as all other outputs to him). However, Alice can spend the HTLC output if the CLTV has expired. The minimum CSV allowed controls the worst-case HTLC that can be accepted; CSV of a few hours should be okay if one is online all the time. Christopher Jamthagen proposed the implementation of timestop feature for CLTV to make the difference between the number of blocks until either expiration the same in case of a block-filling attack. Rusty also suggested that outsourcing is possible for checking the blockchain and miners can be incentivized with a fee to keep an extra eye for cheaters on the blockchain. Outsourcability scales well and can be automated by including it in the "steal" transaction.</summary>
