    <summary>Mashuri Clark shared a link to the unique implementation of time lock encryption called Timechain with Rusty Russell by email. Although Rusty appreciated the idea, he did not see its relevance to the development of the lightning network. It seems that Rusty has set strict guidelines for the mailing list managed by him to prevent spamming. Mashuri assures Rusty of staying within his parameters and not getting too authoritarian while doing so.The post on roberts.pm describes a unique way of implementing a time lock which could be useful for different implementations of HTLC's or time-sensitive rewards/penalties. The authors are working on integrating adjustable difficulty and distribution for rewards which is equivalent to creating micro POW mining environments. This could potentially be used as a tool for payment channels. More details can be found in the Bitcointalk forum link provided in the post.</summary>
