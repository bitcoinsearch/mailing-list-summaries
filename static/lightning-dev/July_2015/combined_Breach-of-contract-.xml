    <summary>The email conversation discusses the design of Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) and how they can be invalidated. Joseph Poon suggested a contestation period to prevent an older version of a transaction from being broadcast through a credible threat. This means that all outputs redeemable by A must be delayed if it is A's commitment transaction. The current/unexpired HTLCs will have the same payout and enforcement, but there is a risk of broadcasting older commitments and stealing the HTLC payout.Furthermore, the discussion highlights two implications of HTLCs in the Lightning Network: constant monitoring of the blockchain and doubling the HTLC timeout. Constant monitoring is required due to the de-facto low interval of HTLC-TIMEOUT, and doubling the HTLC timeouts may bias towards less graph centralization but result in higher fees. This is because the HTLC timeout and the OP_CSV revocation are interlinked. The proposed solution involves having some funds in reserve available on one's own channel balance to ensure honesty and making sure that the total value of the HTLCs must be below one's own reserve balance for both parties.</summary>
