    <summary>The master branch of lnd now fully supports anchor outputs, but some users have raised concerns about the extra cost and potential UTXO bloat. Olaoluwa Osuntokun addresses these concerns in an email thread, stating that while the new default commitment weight is slightly higher, both parties can recover the extra anchor cost if they choose to do so. The force cases in the ideal case are only due to nodes needing to go on-chain to sweep HTLCs, so the extra bytes may be dwarfed by several HTLCs. Osuntokun also explains that using two anchors with their special scripts allows anyone to sweep these outputs several blocks after the commitment transaction has confirmed, which is better than re-purposing the to_remote output as an anchor. While reducing a CSV delay to the to_remote party is still being discussed, Osuntokun believes that the few hundred satoshis increase in cost for the new commitments isn't worth arguing about. He notes that reducing the diff in such a change shouldn't be the main focus, as the vast majority of the effort is in the upgrade itself. In the future, users will be able to easily update all their users with a dynamic commitment update protocol. By dynamic, users will be able to update their commitment type on the fly, compared to being locked into a commitment type when the channel opens as is today. Overall, the implementation of anchor outputs is a positive step forward for lnd.</summary>
