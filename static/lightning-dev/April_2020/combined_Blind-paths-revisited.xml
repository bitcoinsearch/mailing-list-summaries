    <summary>Bastien Teinturier proposed a route blinding scheme on GitHub that would improve wallet users' privacy by simplifying the scheme and using the same secrets derivation as Sphinx. Some parts of the proposal are kept vague for enrichment based on early prototype implementations.In email conversations between Subhra Mazumdar and ZmnSCPxj regarding anonymous multi-hop locks, they discuss concerns about relying entirely on the sender for sampling the secrets, which could lead to vulnerabilities if the sender has malicious intent. ZmnSCPxj suggests that the payment secret may not be necessary if `blinding` is used instead, but establishing a secret with each hop is necessary due to payment point + scalar and path decorrelation.Rusty Russell explores a scheme for blinded paths proposed by t-bast, which can be used to simplify the rendezvous routing process. The message exchange between Bastien and ZmnSCPxj indicates that they are discussing a proposal for multi-hop locks that would require the recipient to give all blinding points for each hop in the blinded path instead of just one blinding point, as is the case in the current proposal. The proposed change may open up some attack vectors on the sender and requires further verification to ensure it works end-to-end. They are looking for a reverse Sphinx solution where the secrets are established between the recipient and the hops instead.In an email exchange, Subhra Mazumdar and ZmnSCPxj discuss the importance of privacy and security in payment systems. They specifically focus on anonymous multi-hop locks and the potential vulnerabilities that come with relying solely on the sender for sampling secrets and generating PTLCs. The proposal to have a receiver provide a partial, blinded path gives the receiver better privacy protection against the sender. The blinding factors in a decorrelated PTLC-based payment can be generated by the sender, but it is safe for the receiver to provide blinding factors to a partial path as well.ZmnSCPxj clarifies that both sender and receiver control the secrets used in PTLCs, making it impossible for a single entity to control them. Griefing attacks are only possible by not claiming or forwarding the attack. The proposal for the receiver to provide a partial, blinded path would make it harder for the sender to locate the receiver's node and perform an eclipse attack at the Bitcoin layer. However, ZmnSCPxj suggests a modification to the current path blinding proposal for multi-hop locks. The recipient would need to give the sender all the blinding points for each hop in the blinded path, rather than just one blinding point as is currently done. This may open up some attack vectors on the sender as the security assumptions are based on the sender being able to choose every secret from a random distribution. Further analysis and verification is needed to determine if this modification is viable. Overall, the discussions revolve around improving privacy and security in payment systems through proposals such as route blinding and partial, blinded paths. While these proposals have potential benefits, they also come with certain vulnerabilities that need to be addressed through further analysis and verification.</summary>
