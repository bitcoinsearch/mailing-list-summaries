    <summary>The Lightning Network is currently undergoing a significant update, including changes to the core channel state machine, HTLC scripts, and invoice handling. One of the most notable updates includes replacing Hash-TimeLock Contracts (HTLCs) with Point-TimeLock Contracts (PTLCs) for lightning payments, which allows payment de-correlation along routes, improving privacy. The addition of PTLCs also opens up new applications such as stuckless payments, escrow contracts, and monotonic access structures on payment completion. Dual deployment is compatible and rolling out with the latest ECDSA based technique first, followed by the schnorr version later. Payment Points is another new development in the Lightning Network, allowing for barrier escrows and enabling atomic multi-payment setups, but requires Taproot to be used.Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) have been hindered due to difficulties in bootstrapping oracles, which are essential for their functioning. Coinbase's recent announcement of a new price oracle for Ethereum could solve this issue as a trusted entity with a good reputation. Laolu suggests using base DLC-specific channels instead of complex barrier escrow scriptless scripts to simplify the design and implementation of DLCs. The Lightning Network community is encouraged to explore Payment Point Lightning Networks (PTLCs), which offer advantages over HTLCs. PTLCs allow for payment de-correlation along routes and enable a wide range of applications not possible with HTLCs. The community is called upon to experiment with PTLCs before the availability of Taproot, which will enable the use of 2p-Schnorr adaptor signatures in Lightning channels. For now, 1p-ECDSA adaptor signatures can be used with OP_CHECKMULTISIG. A fork of one lightning implementation or Rust Lightning is proposed to be a proof of concept ECDSA-PTLC node that enables testing and playing with PTLC-based proposals.</summary>
