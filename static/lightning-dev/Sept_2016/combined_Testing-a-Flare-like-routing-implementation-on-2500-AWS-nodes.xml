    <summary>The Lightning Network proposes a routing protocol called Flare, which combines local neighborhood maps and paths to remote beacons. The protocol has been implemented in Eclair with some differences between the implementation and the original paper. The inter-nodes communication only occurs on existing open channels, and all routing-related messages are onion-encrypted and routed themselves. A LAN setup with static routes was used for testing, and the modified version of Flare worked on a decent-sized network, but there were several caveats, including poor routing table reconciliation and beacon distances that may not accurately reflect real-world conditions. In addition, the email exchange discussed using Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) as a substitute for pure broadcast networks, specifically in terms of storing information such as onion keys, identity keys, and channel proofs. The HORNET protocol was mentioned as a possible way for nodes to communicate with each other. The author also asked about how the sender can request the receiver's routing table if they cannot communicate directly.Overall, while Flare shows promise as a routing protocol for the Lightning Network, further testing and improvements are needed before it can be considered for deployment in a live network.</summary>
