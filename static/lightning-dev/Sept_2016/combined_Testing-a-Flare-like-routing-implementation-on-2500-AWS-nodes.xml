    <summary>The Lightning Network proposes a routing protocol that utilizes off-chain execution of multiple transactions before being broadcasted to the main blockchain, and Flare is a routing protocol for the Lightning Network. In the implementation of Flare in Eclair, inter-nodes communication only occurs on existing open channels. The team tested the algorithm using a LAN setup with static routes, which may not be representative of a real-world scenario. They found that the modified version of Flare worked on a decent-sized network, but noted several caveats, including poor routing table reconciliation and beacon distances that may not accurately reflect real-world conditions.The authors envisioned that a DHT would act as a substitute for a pure broadcast network, rather than to allow individual nodes to communicate with each other, and HORNET was mentioned as a possible way for nodes to communicate with each other. Gary suggested using modules in Linux iptables that allow simulating packet loss and latencies for negative testing. In another email exchange, Pierre seeks clarification from Viacheslav on how a sender can request a receiver's routing table if they are unable to communicate directly. The assumption is that payment requests would be transmitted off-band, possibly through a QR code on a webpage or similar method.Overall, Flare is a promising routing protocol for the Lightning Network, but there are still some concerns regarding its implementation and potential issues in real-world scenarios. Further testing and development are needed to fully assess its feasibility and effectiveness.</summary>
