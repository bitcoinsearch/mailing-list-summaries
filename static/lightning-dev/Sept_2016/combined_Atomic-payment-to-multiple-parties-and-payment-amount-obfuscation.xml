    <summary>In an email exchange, Rusty Russell has discussed the out-of-band distribution of pre-image and its potential risks. It was concluded that there is no risk in this process and it is even desirable. Otherwise, one blocking node can potentially keep all HTLCs on his payer-side locked for quite some time until their time-outs. Russell also highlighted a possible risk where someone pays $4 in fees to C via B. In this scenario, B can use the H-preimage it gets from A to fulfill the HTLC A offered, gaining $4 and ignoring C. However, if C gets the pre-image out-of-band, it can claim the $5 from B and then B can get its $1 from C. The game theory applies to normal fees as well. Russell proposed that it is possible to atomically pay multiple parties by designating all but one recipient as intermediate parties in the route and paying them a high transaction fee using source routing and explicit fee payment. The payment amount can be kept obfuscated by making the sender the final recipient. This approach is not complicated and has not been previously realized.</summary>
