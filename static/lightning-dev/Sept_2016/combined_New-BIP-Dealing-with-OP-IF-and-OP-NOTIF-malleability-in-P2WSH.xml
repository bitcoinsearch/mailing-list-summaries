    <summary>A new BIP has been proposed to handle OP_IF and OP_NOTIF malleability in P2WSH. The changes only apply to pay-to-witness-script-hash scripts described in BIP141 that have not yet been activated on the Bitcoin mainnet. To ensure backward compatibility, the new rules are not applied to non-segregated witness scripts. In P2WSH, the argument for OP_IF and OP_NOTIF must be an empty vector or 0x01, or the script evaluation fails immediately. This is a softfork on top of BIP141 enforced as a relay policy by the reference client since its initial release.There is a compatibility issue that can arise if a script uses the combination of "OP_SIZE OP_IF" or "OP_DEPTH OP_IF". With this policy/softfork, one needs to use "OP_SIZE OP_0NOTEQUAL OP_IF" or "OP_DEPTH OP_0NOTEQUAL OP_IF", or reconstruct the scripts. More discussions on this topic can be found at https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-August/013036.html.Johnson Lau, a user on the bitcoin-dev forum, has proposed a restriction on segwit OP_IF arguments as policy. He is seeking more people to ACK or NACK the proposal, especially real users of OP_IF. He believes that the Lightning network would use it a lot. Rusty, another user, mentions that his current scripts use OP_IF and OP_NOTIF only after OP_EQUAL, except for one place where they use OP_EQUAL...OP_EQUAL...OP_ADD OP_IF. However, he states that there is no effect either way on the c-lightning implementation.</summary>
