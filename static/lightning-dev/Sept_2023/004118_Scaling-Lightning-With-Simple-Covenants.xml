    <summary>In an email exchange, the sender, John, acknowledges the recipient, ZmnSCPxj, for identifying an error in the design presented in a paper. John confirms that the figures in the paper and the accompanying descriptions accurately depict the design. However, he acknowledges that the quoted text provided by ZmnSCPxj is indeed incorrect and requires the suggested change.
