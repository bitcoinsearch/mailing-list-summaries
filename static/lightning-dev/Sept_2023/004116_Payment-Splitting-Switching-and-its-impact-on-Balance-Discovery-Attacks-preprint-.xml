    <summary>Gijs van Dam and Tony Giorgio are discussing a concept related to decorrelated payments. Gijs expresses his interest in the concept and mentions that it could potentially assist with decorrelated payments on an amount analysis level. He refers to the concept as a step up after having PTLC's (Presigned Transactional Lightning Contracts) and additional timing analysis protections. Gijs is curious if Tony sees this possibility based on a research write-up they did last year, which can be found at https://lightningprivacy.com/en/routing-analysissplintered-payments.</summary>
