    <summary>In the email, Greg emphasizes the importance of focusing on Payment-Channel Time-Locked Contracts (PTLCs) as taproot channels are about to be deployed. He believes it is helpful to review technical topics like PTLCs, which have been ongoing for over half a decade. To delve deeper into PTLCs, Greg has shared a gist on GitHub that examines various aspects such as single-sig adaptors vs MuSig2, sync updates vs async updates, message re-ordering, and potential future updates to mempool/consensus.Greg's detailed analysis of the messages in PTLCs provides insights into engineering choices and compatibility with schemes like overpayment and stuckless, which aim to improve payment reliability. He acknowledges that the provided details may appear pedantic, but he included them to ensure correctness and facilitate discussions. Notably, Greg chose not to include "fast-forward" as it was considered "future work." However, he anticipates that once fast-forward is implemented, there will be several engineering choices to consider.In conclusion, Greg suggests that the information he shared serves as a valuable refresher and invites recipients to engage in discussions about the performance and engineering considerations related to PTLCs. He also raises the possibility of initiating a standardization effort, acknowledging that his understanding may not be entirely accurate and welcoming feedback from the recipients of the email.</summary>
