    <summary>In the email, Rusty and John are discussing an issue related to settling the channel on-chain and resolving HTLCS on-chain. They mention a paper that proposes using "short-cut" transactions to address the cost of enforcing HTLCs on-chain. This approach could potentially be applied to the channel itself, but it is more complex due to the value included in the channel and the possibility of having channels with different capacities in a single timeout-tree. The email ends with John expressing his agreement with Rusty's point.</summary>
