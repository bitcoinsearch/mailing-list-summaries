    <summary>In a conversation between Andy Schroder and Rusty Russell, the feasibility of high-frequency payments using the Lightning Network was discussed. It was concluded that micro-payments are not possible for high-value products that need to be delivered quickly. The possibility of paying the same payment request twice was also explored, but it is currently not possible as it could lead to someone in the middle taking the funds. The absence of a refund address option in BOLT 11 was also noted, and a flag in BOLT 11 which indicates a refund address is needed was suggested by Russell. The limitations of privacy with lightning were also discussed, as the payer reveals their identity to the payee by offering a refund payment request. The purpose of various tagged fields such as 'p' and 'n' in BOLT 11 was also explained.In an email exchange between Russell and Christian Decker, the possibility of paying the same payment request twice was discussed, and it was suggested that this may become possible with version 1.1. They also explored the idea of allowing for amount adjustments while the payment has not been resolved, which could enable incremental payments from the sender to the recipient. This approach could allow for payments similar to simple Spillman-style payment channels, although careful implementation is necessary to avoid new DoS vectors.Schroder also raised questions about the use of real-time micropayments in automobiles, considering issues such as latency and bandwidth requirements. Redundancy measures were suggested, but they would require multinode realtime failover, which hasn't been implemented yet. Despite these concerns, Schroder believes there are many other use cases where a refund may be desired, hence the inclusion of a refund address option in BIP 70.</summary>
