    <summary>A proposed protocol for route discovery and generation in the Lightning Network has been introduced by Billy Tetrud. This protocol requires nodes to know their own local network topology, with a transaction originator querying a number of its connections for the intended destination's routes. The protocol aims to reduce network burden on bandwidth and storage space by not requiring nodes to receive or store the entire network topology. When a node joins the network, it broadcasts its information to all its channels and requests local network topology information from all its channels. It then requests topology information for channels 2 hops beyond until it has filled its cache to its satisfaction. When a node wants to construct a route for a transaction, it checks if it has a path to that node in its cache and asks all the channels on the edge of its cached view for their cheapest path. When a node receives a path request from another node, it checks its cache for its cheapest cache-only path and asks nodes on the edge of its cached view for their cheapest path.Olaoluwa Osuntokun, a co-author of Flare paper, has also proposed a protocol to replace the current flood-the-network style routing used in the Lightning Network. This protocol involves each node knowing its own local network topology and sending queries for routes to the intended destination instead of receiving or storing the entire network topology. When a node joins the network, it broadcasts its information and requests network topology information. When a node receives an announcement message from a node joining the network, it stores that node's info in its cache and forwards that info to any subscribed node. The proposed protocol will help to make route discovery less taxing on the network in terms of bandwidth and storage space.Laoluwa acknowledges that multiple heterogeneous routing protocols can be used within the network just as within the internet. However, the proposed protocol is essentially Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) with a mix of components from Fisheye State Routing (FSR), making it a hybrid protocol that combines reactive and proactive elements to achieve its goals. Laoluwa believes that the system's layout allows for multiple heterogeneous routing protocols to be used within the network, allowing different sub-graphs to choose protocols that best suit their goals in light of the tradeoffs.Overall, the proposed protocols aim to keep both node-announcement messages and route request messages highly localized, which can help reduce the burden on the network and improve efficiency. All the route information can be encrypted and signed so relaying nodes cannot read the information inside, and so the requesting source node can verify which nodes sent that information.</summary>
