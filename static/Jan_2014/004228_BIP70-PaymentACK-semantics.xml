    <summary>During a discussion on January 27th, 2014, Kevin Greene suggested the addition of an error field to improve client interpretation of response. Pieter agreed and also questioned whether the wallet should broadcast the transaction to the Bitcoin network upon receiving an ACK or if it should assume that the merchant server will handle it. Pieter believes that receiving an ACK should indicate that the receiver takes responsibility for confirming the transaction to the best of their ability.</summary>
