    <summary>In a discussion between Jeff Garzik, Pieter Wuille, and Kevin Greene, the question was raised of whether the wallet or the merchant server should be responsible for broadcasting a transaction to the Bitcoin network after receiving an ACK (acknowledgement) from the other party. Pieter Wuille's opinion was that the primary meaning of receiving an ACK should be that the receiver takes responsibility for getting the transaction confirmed. He suggested that the merchant should take this responsibility after delivering a PaymentACK, which would allow the client to go offline. This would also remove the requirement for the P2P network to function as a reliable sender-&gt;receiver communication channel and reduce it to a broadcast medium to get transactions to miners.</summary>
