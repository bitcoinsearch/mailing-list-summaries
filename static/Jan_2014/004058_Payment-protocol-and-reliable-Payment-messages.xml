    <summary>In a discussion about the use cases of stealth addresses, Pieter brings up the issue of the optional "payment_url" field in BIP70. He argues that if the Payment message is not sent to this location, the "memo", "refund", and "merchant_data" fields become useless, which could result in anonymous senders losing their funds without a way to retrieve them. Pieter suggests that the Payment message be made mandatory and formulated as "location where a Payment message must be attempted to be sent to". He also proposes an optimization where transactions are only sent to the payment URL to minimize the risk of confirmation without payment.</summary>
