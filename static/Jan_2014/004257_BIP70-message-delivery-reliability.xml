    <summary>In a conversation between Mike Hearn and Pieter on Jan 30, 2014, Mike explained how the transaction process in bitcoinj works. He mentioned that the transaction would only be committed to the wallet if the server accepts the payment message and acknowledges it. In case of any failure submitting or internal server error, the transaction would not be retried and the UI would show the payment failed. Pieter agreed with Mike's approach as a user perspective, but clarified that it is not what is suggested or required by the specification and not currently implemented in Bitcoin core master.</summary>
