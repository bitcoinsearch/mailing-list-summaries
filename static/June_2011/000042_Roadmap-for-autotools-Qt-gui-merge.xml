    <summary>In an email dated June 17, 2011, John Smith stated that his Qt GUI was ready for merging and had been fully functional. He also inquired about the current roadmap for including the autotools build system to support multiple GUIs, specifically asking if it would be included in version 0.4.0. The consensus among those involved was to merge autotools and qtgui; however, there were concerns that autotools had not been sufficiently tested on native Windows and OSX platforms. Therefore, Pieter requested anyone on the mailing list with a development environment and willingness to test to come forward.</summary>
