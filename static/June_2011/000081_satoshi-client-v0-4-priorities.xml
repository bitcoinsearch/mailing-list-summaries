    <summary>On June 28, 2011, Jeff Garzik mentioned that wallet crypto and wallet import/export are the two "must-have" features for v0.4. Wallet crypto rationale is obvious, and sipa's wallet import/export might need a rebase but seems important for further wallet security. Autotools and other stuff can wait if they hold up the release of wallet crypto. Doug Huff stated that sipa already rebased his show wallet tree, which is in a functional state. It is missing the segfault fix, but the said fix merges cleanly. However, he is not entirely sure it is ready for pulling. The conversation was copied from IRC. All the data generated in IT infrastructure is seriously valuable as it contains definitive records of application performance, security threats, fraudulent activity, and more. Splunk takes this data and makes sense of it.</summary>
