    <summary>The discussion in this context revolves around merging autotools and qtgui. Pieter Wuille, who initiated the discussion, suggests merging autotools and qtgui. However, he notes that autotools are not tested enough on native windows and osx platforms. Jaromil has his autotools branch rebased against git master and included Mark's NOSIGPIPE/NOSIGNAL patch. People are requested to test if it compiles and works on several systems including ubuntu, fedora, mingw crosscompile, and osx. The Qt GUI is almost ready for merging, according to John Smith, who also inquires about the roadmap for including the autotools build system so that it will be possible to support multiple GUIs. Pieter Wuille is in favor of merging autotools now unless there are still known issues with it, such as mingw32 compatibility. If the Qt port is functionally complete and stable, Pieter would vote to have it merged as well under certain conditions. The only disadvantage of another GUI is that the necessary cleanup of RPC/GUI code will now need changes in three places instead of two, but there are more people willing to work on Qt code than on wx code.</summary>
