    <summary>The Bitcoin developers are discussing merging the autotools and qtgui. The autotools branch has been rebased against git master and included Mark's NOSIGPIPE/NOSIGNAL patch, but it apparently hasn't been tested enough on native Windows and OSX platforms. The developers are asking for people to test if the code compiles and works on several systems, including Ubuntu, Fedora, Mingw crosscompile, and OSX. Pieter Wuille is in favor of merging autotools now unless there are still known issues with it, such as mingw32 compatibility. If the Qt port is functionally complete and stable, Pieter would vote to have it merged as well under these conditions: the changes to the 'core' are minimal/trivial and marked as 'experimental', and not enabled by default. However, there is some concern that the necessary cleanup of RPC/GUI code will now need changes in three places instead of two.</summary>
