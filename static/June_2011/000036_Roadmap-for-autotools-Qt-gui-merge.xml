    <summary>In an email thread from June 17, 2011, John Smith expresses that he believes his Qt GUI is ready for merging and asks about the current roadmap for including the autotools build system to support multiple GUIs. Pieter responds that he is in favor of merging autotools now as long as there are no known issues with it, such as mingw32 compatibility. He also states that if the Qt port is stable and minimal changes have been made to the 'core', then it should be merged but marked as 'experimental' and not enabled by default. Pieter notes that the disadvantage of having another GUI is that the necessary cleanup of RPC/GUI code will now require changes in three places instead of two, but there are more people willing to work on Qt code than on wx code.</summary>
