    <summary>In June 2011, Pieter Wuille sent a message to the Bitcoin development mailing list regarding the merging of autotools and qtgui. The consensus was to merge them, but it was discovered that autotools had not been tested on native Windows and OSX platforms. Jaromil had his autotools branch rebased against git master and included Mark's NOSIGPIPE/NOSIGNAL patch. People were asked to test if it compiles and works on several systems including Ubuntu, Fedora, mingw crosscompile, and OSX. A link to Jaromil's autotools3 branch on GitHub was provided. It was reported that the branch worked on Ubuntu 10.10 amd64, including wx gui.</summary>
