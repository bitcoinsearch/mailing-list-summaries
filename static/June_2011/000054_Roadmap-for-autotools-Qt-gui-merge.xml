    <summary>A discussion among developers is taking place on whether to merge autotools and qtgui, and while the consensus seems to be in favor of the merge, there are concerns that autotools has not been tested enough on native Windows and OSX platforms. Jaromil has his autotools branch rebased against git master and included Mark's NOSIGPIPE/NOSIGNAL patch. The community is encouraged to test if this compiles and works on different systems such as Ubuntu, Fedora, Mingw, and OSX. Pieter confirms that it works on Ubuntu 10.10 amd64, including wx gui.</summary>
