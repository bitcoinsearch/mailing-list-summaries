    <summary>In a discussion on bitcoin-development, Mike Hearn requested to keep Mt Gox related discussions off the platform, citing that it was not related to core software. However, another participant argued that MtGox's code is just as related as BitcoinJ or any other Bitcoin software. The issue with Mt Gox's closed source code is that nobody on the platform can do anything about it. Additionally, the discussion of security vulnerabilities should not be disclosed on this platform and should be kept private for a reasonable amount of time to fix them.</summary>
