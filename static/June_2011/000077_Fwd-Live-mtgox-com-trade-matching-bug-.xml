    <summary>In an email exchange in 2011, a member of the Bitcoin development community requested that discussions around Mt.Gox, a bitcoin exchange platform, be kept off the bitcoin-development forum since the company's code was closed source and therefore, nothing could be done about it. The member also noted that security vulnerabilities should not be disclosed publicly but rather privately to allow ample time for them to be addressed.</summary>
