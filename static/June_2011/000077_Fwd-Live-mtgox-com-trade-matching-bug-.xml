    <summary>The conversation is regarding the discussion of Mt Gox related stuff on Bitcoin-development. One person believes that it's not related to the core software, but another person argues that MtGox's code is just as related as any other Bitcoin software. However, the issue with Mt Gox's code is that it's closed source, meaning nobody can do anything about it. The conversation also touches on the disclosure of security vulnerabilities and emphasizes the importance of keeping those private for a reasonable amount of time for them to be fixed.</summary>
