    "header_summary": "SeedHammer is developing a new standard for metal engraved backups using a compact output descriptor based on the PSBT binary encoding, specifically the BIP174 PSBT format's PSBT_GLOBAL_XPUB feature. The textual encoding adheres to BIPs 380-386 and BIP 389, integrating wallet-policies and Miniscript with some limitations, and includes additional metadata such as labels and birthdates.\n\nThe community has debated the choice of encoding between CBOR and PSBT, with Blockchain Commons advocating for CBOR, while SeedHammer supports PSBT for its simplicity and existing wallet software compatibility. Discussions also include considerations on whether to create a distinct header and magic number for the new format or to extend the current PSBT format.\n\nSeeking community feedback, SeedHammer has made available a set of resources for the proposed standard, which are open for review and experimentation via the following links: [proposal], [implementation], and [playground], prior to commencing the formal BIP process.",
