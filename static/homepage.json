Vincenzo Palazzo questions the conclusion of a previous discussion on BIP 21 and suggests improving it with a new version. They mention multiple invoices in the context of lightning and express a preference for working on the grammar. MuSig and MuSig2 are explained as n-of-n signing algorithms by ZmnSCPxj. Gijs van Dam discusses the Payment Splitting & Switching plugin and its potential use in mitigating probing and/or jamming. Lloyd Fournier mentions a downside of using a MuSig API. Vincenzo Palazzo corrects a mistake in a previous post and apologizes for any confusion caused.",
