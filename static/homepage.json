    "header_summary": "Programmer proposes bLIP for implementing Taproot Asset Protocol within BOLT channel format, enabling holding and transferring of assets. RFQ negotiation scheme allows multi-hop payments using Taproot Assets. Invoices denominated in BTC remain unchanged, providing flexibility for asset conversion. Future plans include expanding RFQ system. Feedback sought for protocol enhancement. Release of tapd v0.3 and lnd v0.17 imminent, allowing asset transactions on Lightning Network edges.",
