Antoine Riard proposes fidelity bonds as a solution to prevent equivocation in an off-chain state, with the potential use of a coordinator. Tony Giorgio and Gijs van Dam discuss the concept of decorrelated payments, referring to a previous research write-up. ZmnSCPxj explains the implementation of a sidepool using the Decker-Wattenhofer mechanism, highlighting its purpose as an additional settlement layer on top of the blockchain layer.",
