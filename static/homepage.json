    "header_summary": "The penalty of the actuary and the linear dependence of total fidelity bond on the number of participants are discussed in relation to PathCoin, which uses CTV/covenant and fixes the order of transfer to address this issue. The importance of API design is emphasized, along with the flaws of certain approaches in terms of security. Two designs for creating a vault with conditions and recovery options using BIP 345 are introduced. The need for useful consensus changes is stressed, proposing an alternative approach using BIP 345 and BIP 119's CTV. Bitcoin Core v25.1 with full-rbf peering code is announced, along with the benefits of running mempoolfullrbf. HTLC output aggregation is explored as a solution to transaction recycling, jamming, and on-chain efficiency issues, with the implementation of a covenant and suggestions for a limit on active HTLCs. The possibility of creating a compact proof to eliminate the slot jamming issue is raised.",
