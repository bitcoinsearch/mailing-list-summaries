    "header_summary": "Johan Tor\u00e5s Halseth explores the concept of HTLC output aggregation as a solution to transaction recycling, jamming, and on-chain efficiency. By implementing HTLC output aggregation with covenants, a single output can represent all active HTLCs on the commitment, addressing both recycling and jamming issues. The spender can claim their portion and send it to the desired output or fees, while the remainder is held in a covenant restricted output. Challenges remain, such as the potential for high chain fees and the need for a limit on active HTLCs. Implementing this approach requires a new covenant primitive on Layer 1. Johan also raises the possibility of using PTLCs to eliminate slot jamming.",
