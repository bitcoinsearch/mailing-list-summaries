They also discuss simplifying the process further by eliminating the use of Tapleaves and using only Schnorr signatures. Jonas Nick's email discusses the absence of adaptor signatures in BIP 327 (\"MuSig2\") due to length and complexity constraints, but provides a link to a security proof sketch. Carla Kirk-Cohen explains SimLN, a tool for simulating random payment activity on lightning networks. Gijs van Dam and Tony Giorgio discuss the concept of decorrelated payments and its potential benefits. Vincenzo Palazzo acknowledges an error in a previous post and provides the correct link.",
