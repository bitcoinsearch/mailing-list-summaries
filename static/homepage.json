    "header_summary": "Luke Dashjr suggests using SLIPs instead of BIPs for altcoin-related matters and merging BOLTs into BIPs. They propose adding a third BIP editor to handle the workload. The sender questions whether \"Ordinals\" should be considered a BIP and expresses skepticism about resolving issues with someone named Casey. Peter Todd recommends using \"nExpiryHeight\" instead of time-based expiration and proposes redefining an opcode. Brandon Black discusses the need for proper evaluation of scripts and the use of OP_MULTISHA256. Antoine Riard and Gleb Naumenko plan to find sustainable fixes for the Lightning Network and seek community interest in their research. They aim to reduce fee-bumping reserve value and locked UTXOs for lightning users. ZmnSCPxj explains a core attack on the Lightning Network.",
