    "header_summary": "The latest version 26.0 of Bitcoin Core introduces significant enhancements, including new functionalities, bug fixes, performance improvements, and updated translations, prompting users to obtain the update from the official website or via BitTorrent. Developers encourage bug reports via GitHub and highlight the version's compatibility with Linux, macOS 11.0+, and Windows 7 or newer, though Unix-like systems may differ. Upgrading requires shutting down existing Bitcoin instances, and in some cases, data migration may be necessary, with continued wallet support for older versions.\n\nNetwork enhancements feature experimental support for the v2 transport protocol (BIP324) aimed at improving resistance to eclipse and partition attacks, although it is not enabled by default. The release also includes pruning adjustments for assumeutxo, new and updated RPC commands for improved transaction management, and network information accessibility. Meanwhile, misconfigurations that cause startup failures, modifications to the GUI wallet, and refined wallet behaviors for corrupted records and coin selection are among the wallet updates.\n\nMoreover, the GUI has been refined to better display transaction effects on inputs and outputs, introduce a new wallet migration option, and improve PSBT operations' clarity, with a planned phase-out of legacy wallet creation. Additionally, the testnet defaults to disallowing non-standard transactions, emphasizing the collaborative efforts by numerous developers in advancing the platform's functionality and user experience. Users are directed to the official documentation for comprehensive feature details and instructions.",
