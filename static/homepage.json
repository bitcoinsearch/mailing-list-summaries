    "header_summary": "SeedHammer's project focuses on developing a new output descriptor for metal engraved backups, drawing inspiration from the PSBT binary encoding and BIP174's encoding for extended keys. This proposed format is designed to align with BIPs 380-386 and BIP 389, utilizing a wallet-policies format and integrating Miniscript, albeit with restrictions on inline keys and the requirement to substitute pk(NAME) expressions with indexed references. The format also introduces metadata features like labels and birthdate blocks using PSBT map entries.\n\nThe community is currently engaged in a debate over the optimal encoding method for the project, with Blockchain Commons advocating for CBOR due to its established binary encoding status, while SeedHammer favors PSBT for its simplicity and existing wallet software integration. Discussions also extend to whether the format should have a distinct header and magic number or extend the existing PSBT format.\n\nSeedHammer invites community input on the preliminary proposal and suggests reviewing additional resources and an interactive playground available via provided links for those interested in the technical specifics or contributing to the proposal's refinement before it enters the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal process.",
