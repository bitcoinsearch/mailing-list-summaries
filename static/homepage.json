    "header_summary": "Peter Todd suggests addressing the issue of spendability in the HTLC-preimage path by introducing the concept of expiring the path using OP_Expire and the Coinbase Bit soft-fork upgrade. This approach ensures compatibility with existing nodes. James proposes using the hash of the file itself as the canonical hash in a snapshot file, eliminating malleability issues. Brandon Black suggests considering the benefits of OP_CAT or OP_2SHA256 for BitVM instead of OP_UNVAULT and proposes using OP_TAGGEDCATHASH. ZmnSCPxj explains a core attack on the Lightning Network involving nodes A, B, and C, detailing the steps and implications for each node's ability to claim the HTLC funds.",
