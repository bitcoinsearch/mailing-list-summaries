    "header_summary": "Spam attacks in the Bitcoin network are causing issues with inscriptions and fees. The proposed solution suggests adding a standardization option to address the problem. Concerns are raised about unconfirmed inputs in coinjoins and the need for Replace-By-Fee in package transactions. Front-running in a peer-to-peer marketplace is discussed, with suggestions to quote prices for market activity. The context also includes discussions on system architecture, privacy in the Lightning Network, and a new protocol for closing channels.",
