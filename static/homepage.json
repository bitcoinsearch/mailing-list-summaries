    "header_summary": "Programmer proposes integrating Taproot Asset Protocol into the existing BOLT channel/invoice format, enabling the holding and transfer of assets within Lightning channels. RFQ negotiation scheme ensures multi-hop payments using Taproot Assets, while BOLT 11 invoice format remains unchanged. RFQ system allows senders to be unaware of recipient's specific asset. Feedback and suggestions are welcomed to improve the protocol. Release of tapd v0.3 nearing, marking a milestone towards mainnet release. Users can send and receive assets on Lightning Network with upcoming lnd v0.17 and tapd v0.3.",
