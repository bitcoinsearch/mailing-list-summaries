    "header_summary": "Brandon Black focuses on refining the Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT) format to improve multi-party transaction coordination. He suggests the PSBT should be directly valid or easily made valid, advocating for a standardized descriptor file to facilitate transaction processes between devices.\n\nBlack's enhancement to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 174 includes introducing two new global types: PSBT_GLOBAL_DESCRIPTOR and PSBT_GLOBAL_KEY_NAME. These are intended to standardize the inclusion of descriptors and key names, ensuring better compatibility and communication with signing devices without necessitating further protocol modifications.\n\nThe proposed updates are expected to allow for smoother interactions between coordinating and signing devices. Coordinating devices could add inputs using either PSBT version 2 or create an unsigned transaction with version 1, which can then be efficiently verified and signed by the signing devices, streamlining the overall transaction completion.",
