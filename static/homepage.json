They also mention carefully considering hash contents for each mode and include a table at the end. Ruben Somsen raises concerns about the transmission of invalid transactions or blocks, arguing that relying on trusted entities instead of validating is unsafe and goes against consensus. Alice provides a note inspired by Chris Belcher's post, discussing various covenant proposals in the Bitcoin ecosystem, highlighting the benefits of CTV and the concept of UASF. Vincenzo Palazzo seeks feedback on lnprototest and invites involvement from other implementations. David A. Harding expresses gratitude for work on multiparty channel design and raises concerns about the practicality of certain aspects. GamedevAlice discusses the relationship between probability and anonymity, raising questions about attacks and the vulnerability of individuals.",
