ZmnSCPxj expresses interest in Lightning as a scaling solution and suggests integrating useful features developed on sidechains into Bitcoin. Nick Farrow discusses a draft scheme involving blinding and FROST compatibility for Schnorr signatures. David Stainton proposes improving the performance of the Sphinx cryptographic packet format. Atomic Mr Nuclear clarifies the permissionless nature of Bitcoin and the permissioned nature of the Lightning channel. Antoine Riard suggests investigating anonymous credentials to defend against botnets and shares links to resources on reputation credentials and RSA blind signatures.",
