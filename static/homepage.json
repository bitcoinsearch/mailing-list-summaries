    "header_summary": "Brandon Black has proposed enhancements to the Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT) format, suggesting the addition of two new global types: PSBT_GLOBAL_DESCRIPTOR and PSBT_GLOBAL_KEY_NAME, to standardize the transaction process. The PSBT_GLOBAL_DESCRIPTOR would encode a descriptor with a \"|\" key, while PSBT_GLOBAL_KEY_NAME would pair \"<keyname>\" with its respective value, improving device coordination and the signing process in Bitcoin transactions.\n\nIn another development, Michael Ford has announced the release of Bitcoin Core's latest release candidate, version v26.0rc3, which is available for download from the official website or can be verified via a signed tag on GitHub. Accompanying the binaries are preliminary release notes on GitHub, with this version serving as an important step towards the official v26.0 release of Bitcoin Core, pending community testing and the absence of critical issues.",
