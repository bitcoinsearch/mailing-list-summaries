    "header_summary": "1. Vincenzo Palazzo acknowledges an error in a previous post and provides the correct link. ZmnSCPxj discusses implementing a sidepool using the Decker-Wattenhofer mechanism, including calculations for stages, steps, and blocks. The purpose of the sidepool mechanism is to balance channels. ZmnSCPxj also explores alternatives to the \"sign-only-once\" mechanism to reduce interactivity requirements.2. ZmnSCPxj discusses the fidelity bond and scalability, suggesting alternatives to the \"sign-only-once\" mechanism. They want a mechanism similar to a proof-of-work blockchain, allowing only transaction selection without moving coins without consent.3. Lloyd Fournier's email highlights downsides to using a MuSig API, including potential confusion among new users and the need for historical context and specific API explanations.",
