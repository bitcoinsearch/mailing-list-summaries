    "header_summary": "Vincenzo Palazzo raises a question about the conclusion of a previous discussion on BIP 21, suggesting that each parameter should specify how many times it can be repeated. There is also a discussion on the possibility of having multiple invoices in the context of lightning. ZmnSCPxj explains the n-of-n signing algorithms MuSig and MuSig2, arguing that they enable non-custodial and trust-minimized channels. Another email from ZmnSCPxj explores alternatives to the \"sign-only-once\" mechanism and the desire for an always-online party to select transactions without moving coins without consent. Lloyd Fournier mentions a downside to using a MuSig API, requiring explanation and potentially causing confusion among new users. Vincent acknowledges an error in a previous post and provides the correct link. ZmnSCPxj discusses the implementation of a sidepool using the Decker-Wattenhofer mechanism, including calculations and the purpose of sidepools in balancing channels.",
