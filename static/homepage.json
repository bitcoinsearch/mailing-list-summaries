    "header_summary": "Proposal to Use \"nExpiryHeight\" Instead of Time-Based Expiration in ProgrammingThe sender suggests using \"nExpiryHeight\" as an alternative to time-based expiration in programming, highlighting the issues with relying on time-based expiration. They propose redefining an OP_SuccessX opcode and suggest names like \"OP_Expire\" or \"OP_CheckExpiryTime\" for the opcode. Additionally, they acknowledge their previous mistake and propose a separate field like \"nExpiryHeight\" for cases where a signature covering the field is sufficient.
