A draft BIP update is mentioned, including a proposed reference implementation and a caching strategy implementation on GitHub. Two solutions for ensuring lack of equivocation in off-chain state are proposed, along with the use of fidelity bonds and a coordinator. SimLN, a tool for simulating random payment activity on test lightning network setups, is introduced. A discussion about decorrelated payments and a research write-up is mentioned, along with a correction of a previous link.",
