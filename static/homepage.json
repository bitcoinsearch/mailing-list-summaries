It highlights the method used in PathCoin to address this issue, which involves using CTV/covenant and fixing the order of transfer. The sender also mentions the challenges faced when exploring other ideas related to reusing pathcoin fidelity bonds. They conclude by expressing their suspicion that APO could play a significant role in solving this problem.",
