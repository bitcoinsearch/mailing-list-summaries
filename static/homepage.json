He also questions the effectiveness of OP_EVICT in an off-chain payment pool and proposes alternative solutions. Vincenzo Palazzo raises concerns about the grammar specification of BIP 21 and suggests improvements. Tony Giorgio discusses decorrelated payments and asks for feedback on a research write-up. Lloyd Fournier mentions a downside to using a MuSig API. Vincenzo Palazzo acknowledges an error in a previous post and provides the correct link.",
