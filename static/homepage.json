He discusses cross-input introspection and explains its relevance to CCV+CHECKSIGFROMSTACK. Salvatore addresses concerns on covenant opcodes and suggests limitations, inviting further discussion. The email covers topics like generic introspection, deferred checks, and updates to the BIP. The discussion also includes the concept of probability in the context of anonymity and the need for further exploration. Lastly, it suggests revisiting post-PTLCs and implementing classic keysend as MPP. Tony and Bastien discuss deanonymizing techniques used on the Lightning Network, highlighting the limitations.",
