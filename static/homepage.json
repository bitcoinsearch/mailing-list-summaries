    "header_summary": "The SeedHammer team has proposed a new standard output descriptor for metal engraved backups, using PSBT binary encoding based on BIP174 and adhering to textual encoding standards from BIPs 380-386 and BIP 389. The proposed format emphasizes the use of wallet-policies for key references and excludes inline keys, while also incorporating metadata such as labels and birthdate blocks. SeedHammer is soliciting community feedback on their proposal, offering links for detailed examination, and is considering the formal BIP process.\n\nA discussion has emerged within the blockchain community over the encoding method for the new standard, with Blockchain Commons advocating for CBOR due to its established nature and SeedHammer favoring PSBT for its simplicity and wallet integration. The possibility of creating a unique header and magic number or extending the existing PSBT format is being debated, with SeedHammer inviting constructive criticism on their approach.\n\nIn parallel, the community is addressing the imminent shutdown of the current mailing list by exploring alternative communication platforms. Google Groups, GitHub discussions, a new mailman instance, and a Discourse instance have all been considered, with varying concerns about subscription hurdles, moderation, and spam. A decision-making vote on the future platform is planned for the next meeting, and Matt Corallo has urged community members to contribute their views in the interim to ensure a broad representation of perspectives.",
