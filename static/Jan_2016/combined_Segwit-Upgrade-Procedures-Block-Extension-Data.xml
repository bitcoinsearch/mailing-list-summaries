    <summary>The email thread is discussing the issue of relaying transactions containing witness data. The goal is to add a new service bit, NODE_SEGWIT, and/or bump the protocol version, and for outgoing peers only connect to peers with segwit support. It is suggested to change the fHaveWitness flag for each connection to a NODE_WITNESS service bit as proposed in BIP144. The discussion also touches on future upgrades and adding additional block data. A proposal is made to remove restrictions on the coinbase witness, hash the contents of the coinbase witness, and commit them in place of the current nonce commitment. This proposal would include the data in the blocksize limit to prevent abuse. It is suggested that using the coinbase witness for this makes sense as it is used as a proof of why it's okay to accept this block. The topic is being discussed in a PR on the segwit branch.</summary>
