    <summary>The email is regarding the implementation of Segwit. Pieter Wuille's segwit branch does not yet implement a fix for an issue that may arise, but it is suggested to add a new service bit such as NODE_SEGWIT and/or bump the protocol version and only connect to peers with segwit support. In addition, it is noted that future upgrades will add new block data, such as the prev-block-proof proposal, which requires that blocks commit to another tree. Commitments to a merkle sum tree of transaction bytes, sigops, sighash bytes, fees, priority, etc are also a possible future example. However, this will cause the above relaying problem again. Therefore, there is a proposal to remove the restriction that the coinbase witness contain exactly one 32-byte value, hash the contents of the coinbase witness (e.g. as a merkle tree), and commit them in place of the current nonce commitment. This will be included in the block size limit to prevent abuse. The use of the coinbase witness for this purpose is logical as it provides proof of why it's okay to accept the block. Discussions on this topic can be found in a PR on the segwit branch.</summary>
