    <summary>In a Bitcoin developer mailing list discussion, Gavin Andresen expressed his opposition to weakening the crypto used to protect billions of dollars of other people's money just because other attacks are possible. He stated that it is easy for wallets to mitigate any risks and claimed that a single 20-byte segwit in the scriptPubKey is the best design for security reasons. Ethan Heilman explained that even if all an adversary can do is create two random values that collide, they could use a length extension attack on RIPEMD-160 to find hash(x||z) = hash(y||z). Gavin then asked Matt/Adam if they had any reason to think that RIPEMD160 would be broken before SHA256 and whether they think they will be so broken that the nested hash construction RIPEMD160(SHA256()) will be vulnerable.</summary>
