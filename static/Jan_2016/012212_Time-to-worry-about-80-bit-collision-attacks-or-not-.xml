    <summary>The structure of Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) is vulnerable to an attack on RIPEMD160, which could compromise its security. This was not considered during the design phase, leading to concerns about the reuse of the P2PKH structure. In a discussion about constructing a 2-of-2 multisig escrow in a contract, Pieter Wuille raised concerns about revealing public keys and the potential for theft through H(B and C). Rusty Russell added that this attack would impact the current lightning-network "deployable lightning" design at channel establishment, where pubkeys are revealed in the opening packet to redeem a P2SH using normal 2of2. Pre-committing by exchanging hashes of pubkeys is an option, but it adds complexity to contracts on Bitcoin, which are already challenging to get right.</summary>
