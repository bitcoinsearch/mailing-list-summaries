    <summary>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list suggests a fix for a problem in Pieter Wuille's segwit branch. The suggestion is to add a new service bit NODE_SEGWIT, and/or bump the protocol version, and for outgoing peers only connect to peers with segwit support. Currently, there is a fHaveWitness flag for each connection in the segwit branch that is set when a HAVEWITNESS message comes from the peer, and HAVEWITNESS is sent as part of handshaking. However, BIP144 suggests changing this to a service bit. There is a pull request on GitHub to change this to a NODE_WITNESS service bit.</summary>
