    <summary>In a Bitcoin development email thread, Gavin Andresen proposed a version 0 witness program to eliminate the chance of a bug in the code or test cases. However, Pieter Wuille argued against it, stating that Bitcoin has a 128-bit security target and reducing it to 80 bits is not wise. He also expressed disappointment with the "Here's the spec, take it or leave it" attitude and emphasized that they are making a proposal and hoping for adoption due to its technical merit.</summary>
