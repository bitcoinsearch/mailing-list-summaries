    <summary>The email presents an update on the scheduling of a new launch, setting it for Thursday at 2 PM GMT, as detailed in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/fjahr/asmap-data/issues/11). The sender encourages individuals who are new and might encounter difficulties with setup or testing to reach out for assistance. Moreover, there's an established plan to align the creation process with the timing of the first bitcoin core IRC meeting each month. This monthly cadence is chosen deliberately to encourage maximum participation, noting that physical presence in front of a screen is not mandatory for the kartograf launch. The sender is open to feedback on this scheduling rationale, seeking confirmation or concerns from the recipients regarding the proposed timing and its logic.</summary>
