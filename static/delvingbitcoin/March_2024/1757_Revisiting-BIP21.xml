    <summary>In the discussion regarding payment methods, there's a clarification that both Silent Payment instructions and Lightning are indeed compatible and can be offered simultaneously. This is supported by the fact that Silent Payment addresses, Lightning invoices, and Lightning offers each have a unique Human Readable Part (HRP), identified respectively as `sp1`, `lnbc1`, and `lno1`. This detail underscores the interoperability of different payment systems within the same ecosystem, highlighting their distinct yet complementary roles in facilitating transactions. The inclusion of these examples serves to dispel any confusion regarding the applicability and implementation of multiple payment methodologies concurrently, thereby expanding the flexibility and options available for transactions.</summary>
