    <summary>The concept of adapting a mechanism to Simplicity, which allows for subexpressions returning a value equivalent to the unit type, presents an intriguing solution to the previously challenging issue of implementing a soft-fork solution. The consideration of such a feature requires careful evaluation to ensure it seamlessly integrates without complications related to pruning, delegation, or type inference. However, the initial outlook is positive, suggesting no anticipated problems with incorporating this mechanism into Simplicity.

This development is particularly significant in the context of deploying Simplicity on Liquid, where the first version is expected to launch without an upgrade mechanism. The introduction of a soft forking mechanism could represent a pivotal advancement for future iterations of Simplicity. It is envisioned that such enhancements would be incorporated into subsequent versions, leveraging the availability of multiple tapleaf versions for deployment. This strategy underscores a forward-looking approach to evolutionary development within the Simplicity framework, aiming to address and circumvent limitations identified in earlier deployments.</summary>
