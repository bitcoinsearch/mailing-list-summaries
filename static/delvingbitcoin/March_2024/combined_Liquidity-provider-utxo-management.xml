    <summary>The email presents a comprehensive approach to optimizing liquidity transactions in cryptocurrency systems, focusing on the effective management of transaction fees and ensuring adequate availability of coins for future transactions. It introduces an algorithm that categorizes coins into target buckets based on user-defined attributes and utilizes these buckets to determine when and how to refill them. The algorithm actively monitors the state of each bucket and the current fee rate, creating change outputs to replenish the buckets when necessary. This strategy involves selecting coins not just to cover the spend amount but also to facilitate the creation of change outputs, which are then distributed among the target buckets according to their needs. By doing so, it aims to minimize transaction costs while maintaining sufficient liquidity for upcoming transactions.

Furthermore, the proposal addresses specific challenges encountered by liquidity providers, particularly those operating Lightning nodes, in managing their wallets efficiently. These challenges include the frequent spending of UTXOs for liquidity transactions, the infrequent refilling of wallets, and the risks associated with unconfirmed transactions. A solution is proposed to optimize UTXO management through several strategies, including importing a user-defined set of target UTXOs tailored for different fee rates and transaction requirements, and proactively creating change outputs under certain conditions to refill UTXO buckets. Additionally, coin selection mechanisms are considered to ensure that if a single input solution is not feasible, the generated change output contributes to refilling targeted buckets according to predefined criteria.

Experimental results from testing the proposed solution indicate a potential reduction in on-chain fees by about 15% compared to standard coin selection practices, suggesting that further refinement could enhance the strategy's effectiveness. The discussion concludes with several questions aimed at improving the strategy, such as the possibility of optimizing coin selection parameters through pre and post-processing, the feasibility of exclusively using certain algorithms like branch-and-bound and [CoinGrinder](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27877) to lower fees, and ideas for a more efficient algorithm for adding inputs and splitting change. The email also opens up the conversation to other potential use cases that could benefit from this functionality, including users of coin join.</summary>
