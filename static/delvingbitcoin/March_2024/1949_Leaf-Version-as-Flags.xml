    <summary>The process of selecting leaf versions for the purpose of programming involves a specific criterion that ensures all leaf versions are even, effectively narrowing down the possibilities to seven. This limitation is further emphasized by the exclusion of 0x50 (01010000) as a viable option, as this value is reserved for the starting byte of the annex. The need for additional restrictions becomes apparent when considering the benefits they offer to static analysis. This concept is explored in detail within a [footnote provided in BIP341](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/b3701faef2bdb98a0d7ace4eedbeefa2da4c89ed/bip-0341.mediawikicite_note-7), which highlights the importance of these constraints. In scenarios where the introduction of a new flag is deemed necessary, the recommendation is to utilize OP_SUCCESSx as a more suitable approach. This suggestion underscores the aim to maintain a balance between functionality and the potential for analytical processes, ensuring that any developments or changes are implemented thoughtfully to support overall system integrity and efficiency.</summary>
