    <summary>The discussion revolves around the technical considerations of modifying a parameter within BIP 21. The potential for such a change is acknowledged, however, concerns are raised regarding its impact on existing implementations. Specifically, there is uncertainty about whether current systems that parse parameters as key/value pairs might encounter errors if they do not find an "=" symbol as expected. This alteration aims to reduce the number of characters used in QR codes, which is seen as beneficial. Despite this advantage, the risk of disrupting existing functionalities leads to hesitation in implementing the change. The decision hinges on evaluating the trade-off between enhancing efficiency through fewer characters and ensuring compatibility with established systems.</summary>
