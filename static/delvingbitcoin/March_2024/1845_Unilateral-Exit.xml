    <summary>The discussion revolves around the concept of simplifying or enhancing the efficiency of a potential proof scheme by ensuring that all participants in the accumulator possess an equal amount. This approach could ostensibly reduce the complexity associated with managing diverse amounts, thereby streamlining the process involved in accumulating public keys. The notion suggests that such uniformity might either directly simplify the proof mechanism or at least offer a pathway towards more efficient proof schemes. Appreciation is expressed for introducing this innovative idea, highlighting its potential to contribute positively to the field.</summary>
