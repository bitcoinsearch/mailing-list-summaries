    <summary>The discussion around the introduction of categories for bitcoin-related projects on platforms like GitHub is gaining attention. The idea is primarily focused on providing a dedicated space for projects such as [bitcoin-inquisition](https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/wiki), where announcements and discussions can be centralized. This proposition could serve as an advantageous solution for project owners who might not have the resources or desire to manage their own dedicated forums. Furthermore, the concept extends to enabling project owners with the capability to moderate posts within their specific category, ensuring relevance and appropriateness of the content shared and discussed. This approach not only simplifies the management of discussions related to bitcoin projects but also enhances the accessibility and organization of information for community members interested in specific aspects of bitcoin technology and its applications.</summary>
