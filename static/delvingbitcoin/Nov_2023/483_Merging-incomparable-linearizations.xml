    <summary>Chunking in the context of transaction processing refers to a strategy where the cost associated with a chunk's prefix is covered by its suffix. This approach can vary in its application, with costs being either equal or higher, depending on whether the chunking implemented is maximal or minimal. A critical insight into this mechanism is the preference for minimal chunking. The rationale behind favoring minimal chunking lies in the logistical simplicity it offers. When two chunks carry the same fee rate, merging them during block construction is straightforward. Conversely, dividing a single chunk into smaller segments proves to be more complex. This distinction underscores the importance of strategic chunk structuring in optimizing transaction processing and block construction.</summary>
