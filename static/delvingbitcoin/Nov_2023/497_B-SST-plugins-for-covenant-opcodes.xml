    <title>B'SST plugins for covenant opcodes</title>

    <summary>The recent updates to the bsst plugin system have brought about significant changes in its operation. In the development version and soon to be released version 0.1.2, users will need to initiate plugins differently than before. Specifically, the command `./bsst-cli --plugins=plugins/op_checkcontractverify_bsst_plugin.py` is now required to run a referenced plugin. Additionally, there has been an enhancement regarding the `CAT` opcode, which can now be activated using the flag `--explicitly-enabled-opcodes=CAT`. 

To align with these changes, the corresponding GitHub gist that provides guidance on using the plugin has been updated. While the preference was expressed to revise the original post for updating the information, it was not possible, leading to the decision to amend the gist. This edit took place on November 29, 2023, ensuring that the documentation reflects the latest modifications to the bsst plugin system.</summary>
