    <summary>When considering the improvement of linearization methods, it's essential to recognize that a superior method should be adopted if identified. However, an interesting aspect to note is that combining two different linearizations could potentially yield even better results. This observation suggests that merging linearizations, despite employing a basic algorithm, might produce a linearization surpassing the quality of each original method separately. This insight underscores the potential benefits of integrating diverse approaches to enhance the overall outcome, highlighting the importance of not only seeking better individual methods but also exploring the synergies between different techniques.</summary>
