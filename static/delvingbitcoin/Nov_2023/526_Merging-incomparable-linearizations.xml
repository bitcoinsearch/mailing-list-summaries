    <summary>In the discussion regarding the refinement of a proof, it's highlighted that there is no necessity to include case $\gamma_0 + \zeta_0$. The focus should be on the subsequent chunks for greater accuracy. Additionally, there was clarification on the graphical representation of fee-related data. It was initially believed to involve plotting function $F(\gamma_i)$, but it was actually about the fee rate. The distinction is evident in the provided diagrams which contrast the visualizations of fees versus fee rates.

To facilitate further exploration and manipulation of the related data, a spreadsheet has been shared through a Google Docs link. This interactive document allows for a hands-on approach to analyze the variation and impact of fees over time, as depicted by the illustrations. The graphics included are instrumental in conveying the difference between plotting raw fees and fee rates, underlining the implications for the proof in question.</summary>
