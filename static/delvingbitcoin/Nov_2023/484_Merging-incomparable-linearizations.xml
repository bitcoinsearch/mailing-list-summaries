    <summary>In the realm of transaction processing, a fundamental principle is to prioritize smaller, more manageable chunks. This approach facilitates more efficient handling and processing of transactions. Specifically, when dealing with fee rate subsets, it's advantageous not to conglomerate them into larger groups. Separating transactions into smaller subsets based on their fee rates can lead to more streamlined and effective processing. This methodology underscores the importance of meticulous organization and segmentation in transaction management for achieving optimal performance and efficiency.</summary>
