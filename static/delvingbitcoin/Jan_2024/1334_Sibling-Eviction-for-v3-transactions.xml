    <summary>In the realm of transaction management and optimization within blockchain systems, the concept of "sibling eviction" emerges as a strategic approach to enhance the fluidity and responsiveness of transaction processing. This technique involves the replacement of a transaction that does not directly conflict with another, as it spends a different output from a common parent transaction. The term "sibling" in this context refers to transactions that are direct children of the same parent, distinguishing them from more distant relations which could be referred to as "cousins."

The discussion extends to version 3 (v3) protocols and how they might handle more intricate transaction topologies beyond simple sibling relationships â€“ these would allow for the eviction of any descendant of a shared ancestor. However, there is a note of caution on using familial terms to describe such relationships due to their potential complexity.

Furthermore, the conversation delves into the practical application of these principles to Lightning Network (LN) commitment transactions that are not natively v3. The goal is to enable Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP) actions by broadcasting specific transactions, whether it's one's own commitment with a child of their anchor or a child of the remote's anchor. These steps ensure that one can always bump up the transaction fee through Replace-by-Fee (RBF) tactics if needed.

This adaptability is crucial, as it maintains the mempool's simplicity by sticking to the 1-parent-1-child (1p1c) model, which is essential because package RBF currently operates under this constraint. By enabling a transaction to replace others via package RBF or sibling eviction, it avoids complications that would arise from dealing with multiple children transactions.

The above strategies underscore the importance of maintaining a streamlined transaction topology to facilitate effective transaction fee bumping mechanisms, thereby ensuring the efficiency and reliability of cryptocurrency networks.</summary>
