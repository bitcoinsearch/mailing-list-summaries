    <summary>The recent discussions surrounding version 3 (v3) of the project have been based on the assumption of a cluster mempool implementation. This is an important aspect to consider because v3 was conceptualized before the idea of a cluster mempool came into existence. There is a strong belief that once a cluster mempool is in place, we can achieve much better results than what is currently anticipated with v3.

As we move forward, it's crucial to keep in mind that our initial projections for v3 were made without considering the enhancements that could come from integrating a cluster mempool. The potential for improved performance and efficiency post-integration suggests that there are opportunities to optimize beyond the current scope of v3. As such, future planning and development should take into account the likely positive impacts of a cluster mempool on v3's capabilities and aim to capitalize on them to the fullest extent.</summary>
