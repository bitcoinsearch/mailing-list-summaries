    <summary>When attempting to pay an invoice, an issue has arisen where the payment path to the peer cannot be found. To address this problem, one should refer to the provided GitHub link which points to a specific code example that demonstrates a functional implementation. This code snippet is particularly relevant for cases involving hops across private channels as it necessitates the inclusion of a route hint to successfully navigate these channels.

In the process of solving this issue, another challenge was encountered with respect to accessing private keys required for reclaiming funds. The individual is currently at an impasse in this area, trying to figure out the necessary steps to recover the funds using private keys. It is also highlighted that any functionality not covered by the tests within the linked GitHub repository likely remains unimplemented and certainly untested. The implication here is that one should proceed with caution and not assume that untested code will function as expected.</summary>
