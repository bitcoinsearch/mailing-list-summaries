    <summary>Batched Child Pays for Parent (CPFP) is a concept that could potentially improve the efficiency of transaction processing on blockchain networks. However, there are challenges associated with implementing this technique in a way that is resistant to pinning attacks, where transactions are deliberately crafted to prevent certain other transactions from being confirmed.

To address this, an initial approach could involve adopting a more restricted and less efficient method of creating ephemeral anchors. These temporary solutions would be straightforward to implement and understand, which would make them practical for immediate use. The simplicity of this initial strategy serves as a foundational step toward achieving a usable system.

In the future, efforts can be directed toward developing methods that are more effective and optimal. This gradual expansion would likely lead to enhancements in both usability and efficiency over time. By starting with a basic but functional system, it provides a platform upon which more sophisticated solutions can be built as the understanding and technology evolve.</summary>
