    <summary>In the discussion of blockchain transaction efficiencies, it's highlighted that a child spend should consist of at least two inputs to ensure parity in block space usage between out-of-band miner payments and decentralized payments to any miner. This comparison brings to light the optimal standard for transactions within the network.

Additionally, there is an analysis of an alternative method where the ephemeral anchor value is burned alone, resulting in a transaction size of 65 virtual bytes (vbytes). This approach is debated, with the conclusion being that it carries similar risks to those encountered when users pay for transaction acceleration services to reduce the number of inputs in a Replace-by-Fee (RBF) scenario. The underlying implication is that while seeking efficiency, one must also weigh the associated risks and the impact on the blockchain's integrity and fairness.</summary>
