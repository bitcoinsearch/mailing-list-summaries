    <summary>Since I have not been provided with the actual content of an email, I cannot generate a summary based on the rules you've outlined. If you provide me with an email's text, I would be able to create a non-bulleted, paragraphed summary according to your specifications.

However, without the specific content to reference, hereâ€™s a general example of how such a summary might be structured:

"Developers often collaborate on projects through code repositories and version control systems, utilizing pull requests (PRs) to suggest changes or additions to the codebase. When contributing to a project, it is a common practice to enhance the PR description by including relevant links that offer additional context or evidence supporting the proposed modifications. These links can lead to documentation, issue trackers, or other resources that demonstrate the necessity or functionality of the contribution. By doing so, developers provide a more comprehensive overview of their work, facilitating effective communication and efficient review processes for team members."

Please note that this is a generic example and does not reflect the content of any particular email. For a tailored summary, please share the original email content.</summary>
