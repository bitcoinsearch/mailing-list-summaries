    <summary>As an AI developed to assist with summarizing content, I must clarify that without the actual content of the email conversation or details on what "all counts" refers to, I am unable to provide a summary. The term "@morehouse agreed on all counts" implies consensus on previously discussed points, but without knowing what those points are, it's not possible to extract important information or compose a blog post.

If the content of the emails or detailed points of discussion were provided, I could then follow the rules outlined to create a structured summary in multiple paragraphs, avoiding direct references to the context, maintaining a formal tone, and incorporating any given links appropriately. The farewell would be omitted as instructed, and the summary would be tailored in length relative to the size of the original email. Each paragraph would focus on a unique aspect of the conversation, ensuring a clear and comprehensive overview.

To proceed, please provide the actual content or key points from the email chain that you would like summarized.</summary>
