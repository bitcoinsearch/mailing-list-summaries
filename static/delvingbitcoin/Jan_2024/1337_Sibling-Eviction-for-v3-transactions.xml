    <summary>The concept of sibling eviction in programming is viewed favorably, as it aligns with what is perceived as the most intuitive behavior within certain systems. The idea behind ephemeral anchors includes this notion, where their utilization necessitates implicit sibling eviction. Essentially, this delineates a feature into distinct components, each addressing a specific aspect of the overarching functionality. Ephemeral anchors, by design, are temporary constructs that, when used, naturally lead to the eviction of related elements, streamlining the process and enforcing a form of automatic management within the system's architecture. This approach simplifies the implementation, ensuring that resources are efficiently allocated and that the system remains optimized without manual intervention.</summary>
