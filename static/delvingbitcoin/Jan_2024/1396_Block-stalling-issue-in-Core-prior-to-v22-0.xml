    <summary>The email in question highlights a workaround for a limitation within the LND (Lightning Network Daemon) framework. While LND lacks native support for a specific feature, an alternative solution is proposed by running multiple listening nodes. This approach would allow users to circumvent the current constraint by setting up several nodes that can listen for network activity or requests, effectively multiplying their interaction capabilities with the network. The suggestion serves as a temporary measure until such time as native support is introduced into LND, ensuring that users can maintain their activities without significant disruption.</summary>
