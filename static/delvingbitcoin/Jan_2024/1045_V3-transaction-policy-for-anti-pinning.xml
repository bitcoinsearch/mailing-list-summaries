    <summary>In the current development of HTLCs, there are no significant changes from their existing specifications. The task of addressing the issue of making HTLCs non-pinnable is not being prioritized at the moment due to its complexity and the extensive modifications it would require in the specifications. Despite these challenges, there is a shared sentiment that improvements can be made in the future that will tackle these concerns without overly burdening those involved in specification development.

An inquiry has been raised questioning why the persistent issues with pinning are not being addressed during the ongoing evolution of the specifications, especially considering that version 3 was expected to resolve such problems. There's an underlying sense of urgency to address these matters now, while the specifications are still under active development, as opposed to postponing them for a future update.</summary>
