    <summary>The recent analysis conducted by Peter on the fee margin of error for attackers has been identified as outdated. The core assumption in his assessment was that an attacker would pay a fee equivalent to 1/2.5th of the victim's fees, which falls below the current minrelayfee threshold. However, it is now suggested that an attacker might only need to pay a fee that is 25% less than the victim's fee, resulting in a significant impact on the cost incurred by the victim. This new perspective indicates that victims could potentially be paying up to 2.8 times more in fees than previously estimated based on the older model. This shift underscores the importance of revisiting and updating security and cost assumptions regularly to stay abreast of changing conditions that affect transaction fees and network security.</summary>
