    <summary>Spacechains, a concept within the realm of blockchain technology, are feasible even without the reliance on covenants. The ability to pre-commit future transactions is a notable characteristic of covenant proposals, which could enhance the functionality and potential applications of spacechains. This feature allows for the establishment of channel factories and other advanced structures that covenant mechanisms typically support. By enabling transaction pre-commitment, users gain the flexibility to construct more complex and efficient systems, similar to the capabilities provided by the APO model. Spacechains benefit from this by allowing a more seamless and interconnected series of transactions, which can be predetermined to some extent, fostering a new level of sophistication in blockchain network operations.</summary>
