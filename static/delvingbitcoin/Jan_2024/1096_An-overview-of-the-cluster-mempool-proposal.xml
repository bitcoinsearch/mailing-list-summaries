    <summary>A carveout refers to a specific transaction size in the context of Bitcoin programming, denoting that any transaction of 1,000 virtual bytes (vbytes) or less is considered for this special category. Though the exact specification of a carveout, such as being 10kvB, is mentioned, it's not essential to the particular example being discussed. This concept is relevant when considering transaction fees, block space, and perhaps certain optimizations within Bitcoin's protocol concerning how transactions are processed and validated within the network. Understanding carveouts can be crucial for developers working on applications that interface with the Bitcoin blockchain, as it influences design decisions around transaction batching, wallet architecture, and fee estimation algorithms.</summary>
