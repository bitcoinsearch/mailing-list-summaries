    <summary>The discussion revolves around the limitations of "before the fact" interactivity in replacing covenants, especially when dealing with fraud proofs. This approach is deemed ineffective for complex scenarios where possible outcomes cannot be fully anticipated or enumerated beforehand. The conversation touches upon the Ark protocol, acknowledging that it too cannot escape the inherent costs associated with unilateral exits, regardless of whether covenants are used or not. Furthermore, the post implies that the protocols mentioned could potentially be applicable within the context of the Ark framework, specifically in situations where there's an unresponsive operator. This suggests a level of adaptability and possible integration of the proposed protocols into existing systems to handle certain contingencies.</summary>
