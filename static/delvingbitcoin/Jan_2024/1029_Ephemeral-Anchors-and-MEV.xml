    <summary>Ephemeral anchors with non-zero values might seem unusual, but there are scenarios where they could be intentionally used. These anchors, typically temporary or short-lived, are sometimes assigned non-trivial values for various reasons. One such reason could be to maintain a certain state temporarily during program execution or to serve as a placeholder for data that is expected to change rapidly. While it may appear unnecessary at first glance, the decision to put code in place to address non-zero valued ephemeral anchors would depend on the specific requirements of the system.

In some systems, ensuring that ephemeral anchors do not carry non-zero values might be crucial for maintaining data integrity or avoiding unexpected behavior. In such cases, developers might introduce safeguards to reset these anchors to zero or to manage their lifecycle more effectively. This could prevent potential bugs or issues stemming from inadvertently using stale or incorrect data associated with these anchors.

The necessity of adding code to fix non-zero valued ephemeral anchors is a matter of weighing the risks and benefits. If the effort required to handle these values outweighs the potential harm they could cause, it might be justifiable to implement such code. On the other hand, if the system can tolerate these non-zero values without significant repercussions, then the additional code might be deemed superfluous. Ultimately, the decision should be informed by a thorough understanding of the system's behavior and the implications of these ephemeral anchors on the overall functionality.</summary>
