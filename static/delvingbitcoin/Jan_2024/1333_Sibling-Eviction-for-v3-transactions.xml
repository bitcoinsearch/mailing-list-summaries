    <summary>The term "sibling eviction" pertains to the process of removing a transaction from the mempool that doesn't directly conflict with another but is connected through a common parent transaction output. This concept contrasts with "cousin eviction," which would involve transactions that share an ancestor or belong to the same transaction cluster without being in direct conflict. Replace-by-Fee (RBF) protocols that do not incorporate sibling eviction will only permit transaction replacement if there is a direct conflict between transactions, such as when they spend the same output. Non-conflicting transactions that violate other conditions, such as having too many ancestors or descendants, or belonging to a cluster with too many transactions, would not be replaced under RBF policies lacking sibling eviction, irrespective of the fee increase offered. This interpretation clarifies the nuanced differences between types of transaction evictions and the specific conditions under which RBF can function effectively.</summary>
