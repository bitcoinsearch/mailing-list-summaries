    <summary>Digital fingerprinting involves the collection of information about a computer or device for the purpose of identification. It is comparable to physical fingerprints which uniquely identify individuals. The choice to disclose this digital information should be voluntary, much as one has the control over whether to share their physical fingerprints. This principle of voluntary disclosure aligns with the notion that standards and protocols should be designed in such a way that they do not mandate the involuntary sharing of identifying information. The protection of user privacy is implicit in this approach, suggesting that users should have autonomy over their personal digital identifiers.</summary>
