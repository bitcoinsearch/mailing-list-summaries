    <summary>The ongoing discourse among programmers has touched upon a significant topic regarding the optimization of conflict limits within a system. There is a consideration to transition from restricting the number of conflicts to focusing on the quantity of clusters that necessitate relinearization. However, this shift in approach is brought into question by the introduction of newly proposed validation logic, casting doubt on its feasibility.

A particular point of clarification is sought on the ramifications of handling 100 clusters under the new system. There's an implication that managing such a number could lead to a tenfold increase in elements during a diagram check, potentially up to 10,000. This raises concerns about whether the new validation logic can accommodate these numbers efficiently or if it presents a separate, unidentified issue that needs to be addressed. The dialogue reflects a need to understand the practical implications of theoretical changes in system design and their potential impact on performance metrics.</summary>
