    <summary>The communication highlights a transition phase where discussions that were formerly held on the Lightning-Dev Mailing List (ML) are being moved to a new platform, which is currently being tested. The sender acknowledges the suggestion to utilize the 'lightning' tag as an interim solution for organizing these discussions. Although there is an understanding that this method might prove to be inadequate in the future, it is considered an acceptable initial strategy. The tone of gratitude suggests appreciation for the advice received and a willingness to adapt as needed.</summary>
