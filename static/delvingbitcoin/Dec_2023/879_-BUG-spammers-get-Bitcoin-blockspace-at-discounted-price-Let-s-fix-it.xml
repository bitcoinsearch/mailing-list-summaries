    <summary>In the analysis of system transactions, a crucial factor was overlooked â€“ the differing resource footprints of various transaction components. To build a compelling case for intervention, it's essential to delve into the underlying reasons that shaped the current state of the system. A deeper understanding of these motivations will provide a more substantial foundation for suggesting changes and improvements to the transaction process. It is important to recognize that without this insight, any proposed modifications might not fully address the complexities of the system or could inadvertently neglect critical aspects that contribute to its present configuration.</summary>
