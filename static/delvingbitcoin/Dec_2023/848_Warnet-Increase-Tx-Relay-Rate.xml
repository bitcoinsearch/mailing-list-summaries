    <summary>The rate at which blocks are produced is directly tied to the frequency with which transactions are cleared from the mempool. Theoretically, it is possible to accelerate block productionâ€”for instance, by configuring the system to mine a block every 5 minutes, which would effectively double the transaction creation rate. However, this adjustment does not come without complications. Specifically, Bitcoin Core has certain transaction relay configurations that do not automatically adjust in proportion to the increased block production. As a result, this could lead to skewed outcomes. The portion of code in question can be found within the Bitcoin repository on GitHub, providing specific examples of these relay settings.

A potential workaround for this issue might involve the use of 'mocktime,' a feature that allows for the manipulation of time in the context of block mining, which could potentially address the non-scaling transaction relay values. However, the effectiveness and practicality of using mocktime to resolve such discrepancies require further exploration.</summary>
