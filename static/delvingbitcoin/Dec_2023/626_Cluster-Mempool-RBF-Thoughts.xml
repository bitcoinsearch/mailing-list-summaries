    <summary>The email touches upon the subject of Radial Basis Function (RBF) and its potential to affect multiple clusters without merging them, which could be perceived as an odd occurrence. It is acknowledged that there isn't a clear understanding of whether such behavior is unusual or not. However, it's suggested that if a series of small transaction chains were generated and subsequently consolidated into a single transaction via RBF, this might lead to the elimination of several existing clusters in favor of creating one new cluster. This consolidation process is highlighted as unlikely to occur frequently in practice due to the substantial increase in fees when transactions conflict with numerous others. Despite the rarity of such events, it is mentioned that esoteric RBF pinning vectors have been discussed previously, hinting at some awareness within the community about these possibilities. The writer expresses a desire to remain open to various outcomes unless there are specific concerns related to CPU usage that need addressing.</summary>
