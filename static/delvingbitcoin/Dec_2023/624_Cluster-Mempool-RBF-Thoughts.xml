    <summary>In addressing the challenges posed by cluster sizes and the number of clusters that can be concurrently accessed, a strategic approach is suggested. The recommendation is to focus on managing the number of allowed clusters rather than altering the cluster size itself. It is advised that this number should be significantly less than 100, denoted as "N &lt;&lt; 100." This constraint will mean that a transaction may still encounter conflicts with up to 100 other transactions within each cluster, but only up to a limited number of such clusters. By implementing this strategy, the impact on system operations is expected to be minimized while still effectively controlling the complexity and potential conflict scope within the transactional environment.</summary>
