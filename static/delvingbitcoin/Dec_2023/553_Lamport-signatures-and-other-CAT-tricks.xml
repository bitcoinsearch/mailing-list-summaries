    <summary>The recent discourse among programmers has shed light on the potential enhancement of security protocols in cryptocurrency transactions. A notable suggestion is the mandatory disclosure of additional data, such as the script hash, in the transaction annex. This proposal emphasizes reinforcing the association between the tweak and its commitment to the public key during the validation process.

The discussion further considers the possibility of deprecating keyspends altogether. The rationale behind this stems from the anticipated high cost and impracticality of attacking every user; instead, it is surmised that attackers would focus their efforts on large treasuries and older Pay to Public Key (P2PK) coinbase outputs due to their value. It is posited that these entities, particularly treasuries, could preemptively establish a 'quantum proof exit hatch', providing an added layer of security against quantum attacks. This preventative measure is seen as viable and desirable, especially if it incurs minimal costs for the treasuries involved.</summary>
