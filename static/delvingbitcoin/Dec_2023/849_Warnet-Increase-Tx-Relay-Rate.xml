    <summary>The email suggests the possibility of achieving accurate results swiftly using mocktime, though it emphasizes the need for caution in its implementation. The sender believes that establishing a real-time baseline might be an easier alternative for comparison purposes. This indicates a consideration of different approaches to handling time in programming contexts, weighing the practicality and precision of using simulated time against real-world time tracking. The discussion reflects on the complexities involved in ensuring the correct application of mocktime to achieve the desired outcomes and the potential benefits of having tangible benchmarks for validation.</summary>
