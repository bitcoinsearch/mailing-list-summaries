    <summary>The proposed equation `WUtx = 4·size(tx_data|segwit_data) - 3·min(3·size(tx_data), size(segwit_data))` suggests a method to discourage the disproportionate use of witness space in Bitcoin transactions without adversely affecting regular users. This formula aims to make the use of excess witness space less economically viable. However, it's noted that BRC-20 spam, which is a significant source of blockchain bloat, wouldn't be substantially impacted by this change due to its existing structure.

Looking towards the future, it's anticipated that other digital assets will utilize technologies such as runes or RGB, which are expected to be more efficient with block space utilization. These advancements suggest that implementing the aforementioned formula might not yield meaningful results in curbing inefficient space usage, as emerging asset protocols are designed to handle space more effectively from the outset. The communication implies skepticism about the effectiveness of the approach and seems to encourage looking for alternative solutions that address newer asset protocols' characteristics.</summary>
