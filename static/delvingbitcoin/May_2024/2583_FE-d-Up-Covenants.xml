    <summary>In the correspondence, a potential typo was identified concerning the encryption process described. Specifically, there is confusion over the use of the variable $m$ in the phrase "Next, encrypt $m$", where it's suggested that perhaps $m$ should be replaced with $p$. Furthermore, the equation provided, $UniqueSecKey(p, TX) = Add(m, CTVHash(TX))$, is also questioned for the same reason, proposing that $m$ might erroneously be used in place of $p$. This points to a need for clarification or correction in the use of variables within the encryption context mentioned.</summary>
