    <summary>The discussion revolves around the possibility of dividing DynComms into two distinct proposals, focusing on whether this division would facilitate better engagement and prioritization from entities such as Eclair, CLN, and LDK. The primary consideration is whether separating the aspects related to funding output conversion from those without could streamline the negotiation and implementation process. This approach might involve creating separate documents or initiating different pull requests for the same document if it aids in aligning the negotiation processes.

Furthermore, there's an expressed interest in leveraging DynComms for TRUC commitments, suggesting that breaking up the proposal could not only clarify the scope of work but also potentially enhance its applicability and effectiveness in future developments. This sentiment indicates a readiness to adapt the proposal's structure to ensure more strategic collaboration and support from key stakeholders within the project's ecosystem.</summary>
