    <summary>Ecash is positioned as a custodial accounting layer anticipated to be embraced predominantly by regulated banks or private entities, rather than dark net markets. The high risks associated with dark net markets deter their adoption of Ecash. This technology provides a framework that complies with the regulatory standards expected by traditional financial systems, making it more suitable for institutions that operate within the bounds of financial regulation. Its design caters to the needs of these regulated entities, offering a secure and reliable method of transaction that aligns with existing legal and operational frameworks.</summary>
