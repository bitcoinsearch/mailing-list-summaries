    <summary>The recent discussions highlight the necessity for a new output script type due to CISA's requirements. Incorporating it into the existing P2TR framework would necessitate a hardfork, presenting significant operational challenges. However, there's a consensus on the feasibility of using the same address format, specifically bech32m, for this new script type. This approach would ensure consistency and potentially streamline integration processes, making it easier for users and systems to adapt without having to navigate through entirely new address formats. The adoption of bech32m, already familiar within the ecosystem, could facilitate a smoother transition and broader acceptance of the new output script type.</summary>
