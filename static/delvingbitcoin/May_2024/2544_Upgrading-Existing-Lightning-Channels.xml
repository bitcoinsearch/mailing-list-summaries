    <summary>The discussion emphasizes the utility of splicing in scenarios where upgrades necessitate the expenditure of the current funding output. It posits that introducing an alternative protocol for such purposes could complicate matters unnecessarily, given that splicing already performs this function. On the other hand, it acknowledges the need for a different protocol for upgrades that do not involve spending the funding output. In this context, dynamic commitments are highlighted as a suitable option, indicating their potential effectiveness in addressing these specific upgrade requirements. This analysis suggests a strategic approach to protocol selection based on the nature of the upgrade, favoring simplicity and efficiency by leveraging existing solutions where applicable and exploring new protocols where necessary.</summary>
