    <summary>Blindbitd leverages taproot outputs from a block as inputs for its scanning function, showcasing an innovative approach to handling transactions. This methodology circumvents the need for labeling tweaks with their respective transaction IDs (txid), a common practice in blockchain operations. Instead, it necessitates scanning through all the outputs of a block to identify relevant tweaks. This process is facilitated by maintaining a mapping between `ScriptPubKey` and the tweak computed during an earlier step. Although this does not provide a direct association between `txid` and tweak, it enables an indirect method to ascertain a transaction's tweak by examining its outputs. This strategy significantly reduces the necessity to scan every output of a block for each tweak, bypassing the requirement for directly tagging tweaks with their `txid`. Nevertheless, it introduces the need for effectively grouping the outputs to streamline the identification process. This approach reflects a nuanced understanding of blockchain technology, offering a potentially more efficient way to manage and verify transactions without compromising on the integrity or security of the data involved.</summary>
