    <summary>The idea of establishing a working group named `wg-silent-payments` is being considered to streamline discussions and efforts surrounding several key areas in the development of silent payments. These areas include standardizing indexes for light clients, PSBT support for sending and spending silent payment outputs, and developing a silent payments descriptor. The motivation behind forming this working group stems from the observation that many of these discussions are currently scattered across various forums and at a stage where drafting BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) or initiating mailing list posts might be premature. Therefore, consolidating these discussions within a working group is seen as a strategic move to foster focused and efficient progress on these fronts.</summary>
