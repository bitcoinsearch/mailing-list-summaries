    <summary>The provided GitHub repository, [kayabaNerve/fcmp-plus-plus](https://github.com/kayabaNerve/fcmp-plus-plus/tree/develop/crypto/fcmps), serves as a reference for cryptographic works, particularly focusing on the first layer of cryptography that deals with key management, key image generation, and amount commitment. This layer is crucial because it addresses the susceptibility to related-key attacks, a significant vulnerability when the key image generator remains constant. Such attacks are particularly relevant in the context of stealth address protocols like Silent Payments, where creating multiple outputs under the same protocol could allow an adversary to detect if those outputs are being used elsewhere, especially in protocols that necessitate the publication of a linking tag.

To mitigate these types of security risks, the implementation of a per-output key image generator is highlighted as a critical feature. This approach is exemplified by Monero, a prominent cryptocurrency that adopts this strategy to ensure higher transactional privacy and security. By generating a unique key image for each output, it becomes considerably more challenging for attackers to associate transactions with each other, thereby enhancing user anonymity and safeguarding against the potential exploitation of related-key vulnerabilities.

This discussion underscores the intricate balance between functionality and security within cryptographic systems, especially in the realm of digital currencies and private transactions. The evolution of such technologies continues to demand innovative solutions to counteract sophisticated attack vectors, emphasizing the importance of ongoing research and development in the field of cryptography.</summary>
