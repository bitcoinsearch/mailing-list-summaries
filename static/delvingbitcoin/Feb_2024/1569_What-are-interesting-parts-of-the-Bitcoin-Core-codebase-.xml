    <summary>The EvalScript code found in `script/interpreter.cpp` is highlighted as an engaging and educational resource for those interested in learning about stack-based languages. Through the process of building one's interpreter, individuals can gain a deeper understanding of how such languages operate. This kind of exercise is not only fun but also enriches programming knowledge by providing practical experience with the underlying mechanics of script interpretation. The simplicity of EvalScript makes it an ideal starting point for programmers to explore and experiment with creating their own versions of interpreters, thereby offering a hands-on approach to comprehension and skill development in this area of programming.</summary>
