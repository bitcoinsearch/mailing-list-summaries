    <summary>The discussion raises important concerns regarding the potential for incentives to censor a Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO), leading to its expiration and rendering it unspendable. This situation could inadvertently benefit the remaining currency holders, as the reduction in total available coins would increase the value of the remaining ones. However, this scenario is viewed more as an unintended contribution to the community rather than a desired outcome. The worry extends to the possibility that users might accidentally apply constraints on confirmed outputs with an expiration, causing these to become unspendable due to inactivity before their expiration date, a result of user error.

In contrast, when creating a Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT) specifically for asset swaps, these concerns are mitigated. The design of PSBTs accommodates for the scenario where a transaction might expire before it is confirmed. In such cases, it ensures that the output designated for the PSBT creator remains spendable in a subsequent transaction. This feature essentially safeguards against the loss of assets due to transaction expiration, addressing the issue of unspendability due to either intentional censorship or accidental constraints placed by the user.</summary>
