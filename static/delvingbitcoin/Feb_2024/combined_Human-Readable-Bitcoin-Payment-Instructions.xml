    <summary>The Bitcoin community is considering a draft Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) designed to integrate human-readable names with Bitcoin payment instructions. This system utilizes DNSSEC to translate domain names into bitcoin: URIs, which are standardized within the Bitcoin network. The BIP aims to offer a generic solution that applies to various Bitcoin payment methods, as long as they utilize static invoice formats. The proposed framework has been documented on GitHub and invites collaboration from interested parties.

The specification for this system is somewhat fragmented due to its relevance to different stakeholders; however, the majority of specifications tailored to lightning can be found at [https://github.com/lightning/blips/pull/32](https://github.com/lightning/blips/pull/32). This link details a process that simplifies the user experience by requiring only one DNS lookup, thanks to the use of wildcards. While the current approach does not enhance privacy as initially noted, it remains intentionally broad to accommodate all Bitcoin-related payment options, including on-chain transactions and newer innovations like fedimint and cashu. 

For large custodians who might find it challenging to incorporate on-chain addresses, the expectation is that they will adapt after leveraging lightning solutions. The BIP also contemplates potential modifications to reduce the number of necessary round trips during the transaction process, thereby streamlining interactions further. There's an ongoing discussion about possibly including user/domain information directly in the invoice_request to achieve this efficiency.

An alternative method has been suggested, where a user-specific email-like identifier resolves to a Lightning Network node via DNSSEC, and then a bolt12 invoice is requested through an LN onion message. This idea could offer better privacy, particularly for domains with many users, and might be simpler to deploy since it wouldn't require exporting a list of LN users to a DNS database. The proposal underscores the growing demand for user-friendly naming conventions in cryptocurrency transactions, reflecting a broader trend towards enhancing usability and accessibility throughout the Bitcoin ecosystem.</summary>
