    <summary>The concept of a "witness discount" refers to the strategy aimed at dissuading the use of certain types of data, known as bytes, that significantly affect nodes through consensus rules. However, this attempt has been unsuccessful in deterring the employment of such impactful bytes by nodes. The inefficacy of the witness discount is evidenced by the increasing size of the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) set, which is clearly illustrated in a chart provided by Jameson Lopp. Unfortunately, the visual representation of the UTXO set size cannot be conveyed here, but the implication is clear: despite efforts to control growth through witness discounts, the UTXO set continues to expand significantly.</summary>
