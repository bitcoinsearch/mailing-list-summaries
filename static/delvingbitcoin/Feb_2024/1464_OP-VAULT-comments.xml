    <summary>The email suggests that there is a potential solution to a problem within the discussed space, which has not been considered for some time. The sender mentions "collateral" as a possible mitigating factor. The term indicates that the sender may be referring to a strategy or an asset used to secure an obligation and thereby reduce associated risks. This brief mention implies the exploration of using collateral in a way that could address an outstanding issue or concern in the topic at hand. It is important to note, however, that without additional context or elaboration, the specifics of how collateral might serve as a mitigation strategy remain unclear. Further discussion or analysis would be necessary to understand the exact role of collateral in this scenario and its potential effectiveness.</summary>
