    <summary>Understanding the intricacies of CoinJoin transactions reveals concerns about how cluster size limits might influence participant experiences. Specifically, the scenario presented involves a transaction devoid of ancestors, which has an output count surpassing the imposed cluster size limit. This situation posits that only the initial participants up to the `max_cluster_size - 1` threshold would retain the ability to spend their outputs effectively. 

This limitation underscores the importance of considering cluster size when participating in CoinJoin transactions. It highlights the potential for restrictions on spending capabilities based on the order of participation relative to the cluster size cap. Such insights are crucial for users who engage with CoinJoin transactions, as they directly impact the utility and flexibility of the cryptographic operations involved.</summary>
