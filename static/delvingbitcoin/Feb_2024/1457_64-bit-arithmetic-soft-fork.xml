    <summary>When dealing with hashes in programming, it is crucial to process them correctly before performing any mathematical operations. An essential step in this processing involves stripping leading zeroes from the hash value. To streamline this task, the use of a specific opcode called `FROMFIXNUM` can be highly effective. This opcode is designed to handle fixed-size integers and convert them into variable-size integers. It requires two arguments: the size of the fixed-size integer and the byte blob corresponding to that size.

Additionally, when working with different systems, endianness can pose compatibility issues as the order of bytes in a word can differ between systems. To address this, the opcode `BYTEREV` comes into play. It allows for the reversal of byte order within the hash, ensuring that the data maintains its integrity when transferred between systems that use different endian formats. By utilizing these opcodes, programmers can ensure that their applications handle hash values accurately, which is critical for maintaining data consistency and reliability across various computational scenarios.</summary>
