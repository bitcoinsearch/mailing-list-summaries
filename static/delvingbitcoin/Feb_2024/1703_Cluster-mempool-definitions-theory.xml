    <summary>The discussion revolves around the application of the gathering and stripping theorems in the context of proving that \(L_{opt}' \gtrsim L_{opt}\). The user expresses confusion about how these theorems are employed to support this assertion. Specifically, there is uncertainty regarding the role of the gathering theorem, which is relevant when a sublinearization is repositioned to the beginning of an ordering. This alone, as pointed out, does not substantiate the claim that \(L_{opt}'\) is greater than or similar to \(L_{opt}\) since the ordering \(L[p]\) originates from \(L\), not from \(L_{opt}\). Furthermore, there is ambiguity about how the prefix stripping theorem fits into this argument, highlighting a gap in the user's understanding.</summary>
