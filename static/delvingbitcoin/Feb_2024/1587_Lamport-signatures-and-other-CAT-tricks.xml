    <summary>Implementing binary operations in programming can present challenges yet remains within the realm of possibility. The task at hand involves manipulating binary data directly, which traditionally requires a bit-by-bit approach to arithmetic operations. This method, while effective, can be tedious and time-consuming. However, there are strategies to streamline this process and enhance efficiency. One such approach is the utilization of lookup tables, which serve as a precomputed resource for quickly mapping the results of binary operations without the need for on-the-fly computation. Lookup tables offer a significant advantage by reducing the computational overhead associated with direct binary manipulation. An example of this technique can be found in the implementation of binary operations within the context of Bitcoin scripts, as detailed in the provided GitHub repository [lookup tables](https://github.com/coins/bitcoin-scripts/blob/405f3b0dbf64115eab7035482397b322822c6d19/op_lookup.md). This approach not only simplifies the process but also potentially increases the efficiency of operations that rely heavily on binary data manipulation.</summary>
