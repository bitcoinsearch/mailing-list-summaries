    <summary>The content discusses the utilization of diagrams created with [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/), a tool distinct from Graphviz. It suggests that encountering issues, especially those related to rendering on Safari, can be addressed by reporting directly to the developers. This action involves filing an issue on [Mermaid's GitHub page](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues). The advice includes providing a demonstration of the malfunction to aid in troubleshooting, emphasizing that this step is crucial regardless of one's familiarity with Discourse forums. The mention of a potential Safari rendering bug hints at the nature of the problem being possibly browser-specific, thus narrowing down the scope for troubleshooting efforts. This approach facilitates direct communication with Mermaid's developers and encourages a solution-oriented mindset towards resolving technical difficulties.</summary>
