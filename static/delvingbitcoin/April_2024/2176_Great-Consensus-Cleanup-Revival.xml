    <summary>The discussion revolves around the necessity of a reorganization in a system, pinpointing that any such effort would necessitate reverting back to a specific marker, labeled as `185,956`. This is in response to an inquiry posed by a participant known as @recent798. The central focus of @recent798's question relates to the latter segment of a previously shared comment. This segment underscores the consideration for implementing a new rule. This proposed rule aims at retroactively mitigating the occurrence of duplicate coinbase transactions pertaining to two historical events, identified by their unique markers as `209,921` and `490,897`. The suggestion implies a preventive measure to ensure such duplications are avoided in the future, reflecting on past instances to guide corrective actions.</summary>
