    <summary>The email provides a technical solution to a problem related to securing penalty transactions within a blockchain or similar distributed ledger technology. The proposed method involves employing Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to encrypt the penalty transaction, utilizing the data from a previous transaction as the encryption key. This approach ensures that as long as the details of the previous transaction remain undisclosed, no node within the network is capable of decrypting or broadcasting the encrypted penalty transaction to other nodes.

Further, it elaborates on a mechanism designed to maintain confidentiality and integrity within the system. Should any node gain access to the information from an older transaction, it could then derive the decryption key. This key would allow the node to decrypt the penalty transaction. Once decrypted, the node has the capability to disseminate this information throughout the network. This mechanism leverages the inherent properties of encryption to both secure transactional data and provide a conditional disclosure system, ensuring that information is only shared under specific circumstances.</summary>
