    <summary>The Linearization through Incremental Merging of Optimizations (LIMO) algorithm emerges as a pioneering solution in the realm of optimizing cluster linearizations, effectively addressing inefficiencies observed in earlier approaches. By amalgamating the advantages of ancestor-set based linearization with those of computationally bounded searches, LIMO sets forth an iterative refinement process. This method begins with an initial linearization derived likely from ancestor sets and methodically enhances it by integrating topologically valid subsets identified via bounded search. Such a strategy ensures the maintenance or improvement of the transaction sequence's feerate with each optimization step, marking a significant departure from previous methods that either delayed merging operations or necessitated redundant optimal ancestor set searches.

A notable innovation within the LIMO framework is the implementation of merge operations that seamlessly incorporate search findings into the existing linearization without compromising its quality. This strategy stands in contrast to prior techniques, offering a more efficient and effective linearization process. The introduction of single-set improvement steps represents another advancement, significantly diminishing the computational complexity linked with merge operations. This refinement enhances the practicality of applying the algorithm by avoiding the potential deceleration associated with executing multiple intricate merges. The algorithmâ€™s design underscores its adaptability, demonstrating its utility in both refining existing linearizations and generating new ones from the ground up.

The LIMO algorithm also extends its versatility through the development of Double LIMO, which permits the inclusion of two distinct high-feerate subsets in each iteration, potentially amplifying the optimization efficacy. This capability illustrates LIMO's application across various scenarios, including the incorporation of new transactions into clusters without sacrificing linearization quality. The algorithm not only synthesizes different linearization strategies for improved transaction handling within clusters but also proposes a thoughtful resolution to the challenges of cluster linearization. As LIMO and its variations continue to be explored and applied, they hold the promise of instigating substantial advancements in the field, signifying a leap forward in the efficiency and outcome of cluster linearization processes.</summary>
