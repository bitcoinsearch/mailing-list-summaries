    <summary>The proposed method involves leveraging a variant of compact blocks messages to facilitate the propagation of "weak compact blocks" within the Bitcoin network. This approach aims to enhance the robustness and efficiency of the network by employing weak blocks, which are propagated using specifications designed for compact blocks. The primary objective is to ensure comprehensive transaction propagation across the network without necessitating consensus over these weak block messages, thereby mitigating potential DoS attacks targeting the system.

Weak blocks serve as an intermediary layer that aids in the swift validation process by allowing nodes to pull in any missing transactions effectively. By not requiring a chain of weak blocks to undergo validation, this method simplifies the verification process, as each weak block directly references the last confirmed bitcoin block. This eliminates the need for retaining past weak blocks or filling any gaps prior to validation, ensuring that all nodes remain synchronized with the latest state upon receiving a new weak block. The proposed approach, as detailed in an [early proposal](https://github.com/pool2win/braidpool/blob/8d0724f9fb191ddbd5e02afa20f847fc0249f128/proposal/proposal.pdf), highlights how such a mechanism can significantly reduce the latency between the issuance of weak and strong blocks, thus minimizing the historical data required to be processed upon the arrival of a strong block.

In essence, this strategy introduces a more streamlined and efficient framework for transaction propagation and validation within the Bitcoin network. By directly linking weak blocks to the most recent confirmed block, it ensures faster synchronization across nodes and reduces the computational overhead associated with processing extensive historical data. This technique underscores a significant innovation in enhancing the scalability and resilience of blockchain technology.</summary>
