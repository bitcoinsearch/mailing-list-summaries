    <summary>Running over the non-empty `S_i` intersections is not merely an optimization but a crucial aspect of the strategy being discussed. The process leverages multiple searches to uncover interesting structures that emerge from the combination of these intersections. By focusing on the intersections where `S_i` is not empty, the strategy efficiently pinpoints areas of potential significance that are likely to yield valuable insights. This approach optimizes the search process by directing efforts towards the most promising areas, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of the strategy.

The technique's emphasis on non-empty `S_i` intersections facilitates a more targeted search, allowing for a deeper exploration of complex structures. This methodological choice underscores the importance of strategic search placement within the broader context of uncovering and analyzing intricate patterns. It represents a deliberate approach to problem-solving that prioritizes depth and precision, reflecting a sophisticated understanding of how to navigate vast datasets or search spaces effectively.</summary>
