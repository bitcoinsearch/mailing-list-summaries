    <summary>The primary motivation for adopting this protocol is identified as the potential for significant savings on transaction fees. This factor is particularly enticing, given the cost implications of traditional methods. The protocol carries a risk; however, it's emphasized that rational behavior by users can mitigate such risks, ensuring they do not harm their interests. Through prudent and strategic use of this protocol, not only can users save on costs, but UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) owners have an opportunity to generate earnings. This highlights a dual benefit of the protocol: cost efficiency and the potential for financial gain for participants who manage their transactions wisely.</summary>
