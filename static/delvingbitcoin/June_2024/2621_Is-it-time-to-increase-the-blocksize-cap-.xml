    <summary>The email presents a strong stance against the proposition of increasing the blockchain's block size, arguing that such a move overlooks the capabilities and benefits of the Lightning network. The sender posits that advocates for a larger block size either lack awareness of the Lightning network or have not experienced operating a Lightning node on hardware with limited resources. Instead, the sender suggests a counter-approach: reducing the block size. They believe this adjustment would better serve the network's efficiency and accessibility. To support their viewpoint, the sender references a video that outlines the advantages of decreasing the block size. This material is provided as evidence of why a smaller block size could be beneficial, accessible through [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqNEQS80-h4). The email emphasizes a critical examination of blockchain scalability solutions, advocating for strategies that prioritize sustainability and inclusivity in network participation.</summary>
