    <summary>The text addresses the challenge of peer discovery in decentralized systems, focusing on the utilization of directory nodes by both makers and takers. This approach, however, introduces a new question regarding the operation of these directory nodes, highlighting a fundamental issue in the architecture of decentralized networks. By shifting the task to directory nodes, the problem of peer discovery remains somewhat unresolved, merely transitioning the responsibility to another component of the network infrastructure. This shift underscores the need for a reliable mechanism or entity responsible for running these directory nodes, which is crucial for the effective functioning of the system as a whole.</summary>
