    <summary>The selection of port 38333 as the default for the proxy was initially criticized, prompting a change to port 8324. This adjustment reflects responsiveness to feedback and a commitment to optimizing technical configurations. Success in initial testing has been acknowledged, setting a positive tone for future development endeavors. There is an expressed intention to refactor the code to utilize btcd packages for handling version 1 messages. Additionally, there's a strategic interest in exploring modifications to the btcd framework to facilitate version 2 connections, leveraging existing code. This approach indicates a forward-looking strategy aimed at enhancing functionality and compatibility within the project's infrastructure.</summary>
