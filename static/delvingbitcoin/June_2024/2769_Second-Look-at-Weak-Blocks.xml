    <title>Second Look at Weak Blocks</title>

    <summary>The discussion revolves around the utility of weak blocks in the context of blockchain technology, particularly focusing on their potential to enhance fee estimation for latency-sensitive transactions. Weak blocks are suggested as a solution for providing better fee estimation because they offer a preview of the transactions that miners are currently working on. This insight could be particularly valuable for transactions where timing is crucial, allowing users to adjust their fees accordingly to increase the chances of timely inclusion in the blockchain.

However, the application of weak blocks raises questions about their structure and the dynamics between them. Specifically, there's uncertainty about how it would be feasible to maintain multiple weak blocks simultaneously and whether these blocks would act as competing chain tips or if they could be structured sequentially, one atop another. The challenge lies in understanding the mechanism through which weak blocks, sourced from a diverse set of miners across the peer-to-peer network, could be organized cohesively. The inquiry seeks clarification on how weak blocks might interact with each other, considering the potential complexity arising from their distribution across different miners and the implications for blockchain coherence and transaction processing efficiency.</summary>
