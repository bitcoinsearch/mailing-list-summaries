    <summary>The discussion emphasizes the inherent challenges faced by language designers in ensuring that developers use programming languages safely and responsibly. It acknowledges that while the design of a programming language can provide tools for writing safe programs, it cannot compel developers to utilize these tools correctly. There is an inherent risk when developers adopt an overly simplistic approach to coding, such as assuming certain operations will never lead to errors like overflow, and thus neglecting safer practices.

Moreover, the text highlights a gap in the current programming landscape: the absence of tools specifically designed to facilitate the creation of safe programs. This situation poses a problem for developers who prioritize safety in their work, as they lack the necessary resources to achieve this goal effectively. The narrative suggests a need for innovation within programming languages to address this deficiency, making it easier for conscientious developers to adhere to best practices in software safety.</summary>
