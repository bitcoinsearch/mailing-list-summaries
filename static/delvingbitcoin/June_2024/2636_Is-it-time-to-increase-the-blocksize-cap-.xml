    <summary>The process of establishing node channels within a network can be both cost-effective and time-efficient, depending on the user's preferences and willingness to wait. Users who are not in a hurry and are willing to wait for days for a channel batch to be processed may benefit from significantly reduced costs. This reduction in expenses is primarily because these operations are subsidized by users who have larger transactions or a higher urgency for their channel establishment, necessitating priority processing.

Moreover, the principle of attaining a cheap node through patience applies not only under current conditions but also holds potential with the advent of somewhat larger blocks. The mechanism behind this involves the synchronization process, which, over time, aligns with the user's needs if they exhibit patience. Essentially, the system rewards those willing to accommodate longer waiting periods with lower costs, ensuring that users with different priorities and resources can effectively participate and benefit from the network's offerings.</summary>
