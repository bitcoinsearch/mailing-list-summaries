I said, sure.\\nAnd we did a phone call and I was like, whoa, this is ambitious.\\nHe's setting the bar like up there.\\nI kept doing what I could and I was not in the residency, but one week before the program began, Chaincode Labs called again and said, okay, you've been doing this since March and now we're late May, would you like to come to New York?\\nAnd so I did end up going to Chaincode Labs, even though they said no.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"[jonatack.github.io](https://jonatack.github.io/)\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"The Grant Process\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Stephan: 00:03:49\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"That's a great story.\\nAnd I think what has happened over time, because I know part of your story is that you were working unpaid, right?\\nYou were doing this just because you believed in it.\\nAnd so then there was also a journey of trying to get sponsorship or grant money or funding to sustain yourself.\\nSo could you explain a little bit about that process?\\nBecause I think listeners will be interested.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Jon: 00:04:17\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Right, so basically when I began in 2019 it was brutal.\\nIt was the bottom of the bear market, the previous bear market, and at that time none of the currently existing funding structures were in place.\\nYour only options were to be hired by Blockstream or Chaincode Labs.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Stephan: 00:04:40\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"MIT DCI maybe.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Jon: 00:04:41\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah, but they didn't have these grants that are very prevalent now and the situation is much better now, much easier.\\nReally, you need to show proof of work.\\nYou need to show up humbly, you gotta stay humble.\\nYou're gonna learn a lot, you're gonna fall down a lot, and you need to try to add value while respecting other people's time and being humble about it, you're gonna make lots of mistakes.\\nThere's so much accumulated context and experience that the long-term contributors have that a newcomer will not, but that doesn't mean you can't provide value if you're careful about it, and thoughtful, and take the time.\\nIt took me literally, back then, one year to be funded.\\nThank you to Jack Dorsey who created Square Crypto, now since renamed Spiral.\\nI didn't actually do anything to get a grant.\\nYou are just showing proof of work and after a while people will push grantees to...\\nI suppose nowadays you can apply for grants with a project. \\nBut I never had a project. \\nMy only project was to review and to contribute and to fix things that I saw.  \\nI never had a project dropped into my lap. \\nLike I'm going to implement this, I'm going to do fedimint, or I'm going to do you know payjoin, or joinmarket or BIP324 implementation or BIP155 implementation.\\nI never had anything like that.\\nAll I did was review and basically do the things that no one else wanted to do, but that needed to be done, like reviewing and testing and fixing things.\\nAnd after a while, that worked.\\nIt took me a long time.\\nIt was pretty hard.\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"Different Ways to Contribute to Bitcoin Core\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Stephan: 00:06:24\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So for the layman audience who don't understand the nuances of software development and Bitcoin Core, can you explain the difference between writing a pull request, making some new code for Bitcoin Core and doing that other role that you was mentioning, the review, the testing?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Jon: 00:06:41\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Right, I think that gets back to what does a Bitcoin Core developer do and I think it doesn't correspond to the image that most people have of what we're actually doing.\\nI would say most of the time what we're doing is reading code, reading other people's ideas and thinking and maybe testing and reviewing.\\nIn my case, there's very little coding.\\nI was a full-time software engineer from quite a long time before, where you basically you just churn out the code, and check off the boxes as fast as you can during your current sprint, before the next sprint starts. \\nBitcoin Core is is different.\\nYou have to be more patient.  \\nThere's more thinking going on and nuance and things don't always go quickly.\\nIt depends on what it is.\\nSo I would say the most important role in Bitcoin Core and what is most lacking is review and testing.\\nIt's not coding and also spending time thinking through what other people are saying, testing, verifying.\\nOkay, maybe they're right.\\nMaybe they're wrong.\\nYou need to come to these conclusions and pretty much you do it on your own.\\nWell I've always worked alone.\\nSome people work in large organizations, some people work at Spiral, some people work at Chaincode, some people work at Blockstream.\\nBut even Blockstream, they only support one Bitcoin Core developer, Andrew Chow, and I believe he works mostly alone unless you travel into an office.\\nSo a lot of it is just alone time with a code, reading things, reading the mailing list, coming to your conclusions.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Stephan: 00:08:17\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So going on from that, could you maybe outline as an example where some of the discussion takes place and then where the interaction back and forth with other developers happens?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Jon: 00:08:41\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"The interaction happens either on the Bitcoin Core Dev IRC channel or on the pull request on GitHub, generally, and occasionally on the mailing list.\\nThose are the three areas.\\nAnother thing that core developers do is educate.\\nThey don't only work on Bitcoin Core, they might review and help write for Bitcoin Optics Weekly Newsletter.\\nI did that for two years.\\nI see Murch is in the room.\\nHe's currently on the Bitcoin Optech team.\\nThey also perhaps help run the Bitcoin Core PR Review Club, which I also did for two years.\\nThese are annex activities that many core developers do in addition to working only on Bitcoin Core.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Stephan: 00:09:24\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"One other area that I think is interesting, and I know you mentioned this to me offline.\\nSo with Bitcoin Core, as I understand, most of the code is in C++ and a lot of the testing is in Python.\\nBut you mentioned that you actually had to learn this as part of your process.\\nCan you elaborate a bit?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Jon: 00:09:42\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Correct.\\nSo Satoshi Nakamoto wrote in C++.\\nAnd the functional test suite is in Python.\\nNow, before I'd arrived, I had not coded in either one.\\nI'd had C back in my college days.\\nBut my personal work experience was we're in completely different languages.\\nAssembly and web development in Ruby and Ruby on Rails, for example.\\nSo, yeah, but if I can do it, I think anyone can.\\nI arrived and I taught myself C++ while doing it.\\nPython came quickly because it's similar to Ruby.\\nBut yeah, it's not impossible for you to show up and to learn these two languages and become a core developer if that is your goal.\\nNote that there isn't just Bitcoin Core and I think that's important to underline.\\nThere are many other valuable projects in the space besides Bitcoin Core.  \\nThere are wallets, miners, lightning implementations, lightning development, specification, bolts, BIPs.\\nThere are many super valuable projects.\\nIt doesn't have to be Bitcoin Core and even it doesn't have to be open source, you could work on closed source.\\nThere's lots of jobs out there now for Bitcoin Developers, and it doesn't just have to be a developer, you could also find a place for yourself if you're a product manager, a designer, a writer, we need people like that in the space.\\nMaybe not on Bitcoin Core, which is just developers, but in other areas.\\nOr you could become a startup founder.\\nThere are more and more VCs who are willing to fund Bitcoin and now lightning startups.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Stephan: 00:11:18\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So could you elaborate a little bit in terms of non-developer contributions?\\nSo let's say somebody's out there, they're interested to get involved.\\nMaybe they're not quite a developer, but they are, let's say, tech savvy and interested to contribute.\\nWhat are some ways that they could do that?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Jon: 00:11:34\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Well, for example, I believe that Spiral, who was my first sponsor and still a sponsor of mine, I believe that they're quite interested in finding product managers because a good product manager can have a lot of impact by leveraging their work through developers and designers.\\nAnd I think they're very happy with the one or two product managers they do currently support and might be interested in more.\\nI don't know if I answered your question.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Stephan: 00:12:04\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah, that's one example.\\nAnd I know even some other open source projects are looking for translators as an example.\\nSo literally no coding, just literally someone who can translate and make that wallet or that software accessible in other languages.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Jon: 00:12:19\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"There was a period of about two years when Spiral was also giving grants to a lot of designers.\\nI don't know if they're doing that so much currently because we are unfortunately in a bear market, but you can always apply.\\nIf you research it, you'll find that there are many funding organizations now, especially compared to four years ago when I began.\\nBut the first step isn't to apply for a grant unless you're already well established in the space.\\nThe first step is to apply to Chaincode Labs online seminar, either Bitcoin or Lightning, or Summer of Bitcoin, or a number of other excellent programs that are up and coming to educate people in space \"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Stephan: 00:13:00 \"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Right and yesterday on the same stage we had some other organizations like Vinteum, Library of Satoshi, and Torogoz as well.\\nSo these are some other organizations that you can potentially...\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Jon: 00:13:12\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I believe there's one that's being started by Marina Spindler, I can't remember the name, for El Salvador focused.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Stephan: 00:13:19\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"That's Torogoz.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Jon: 00:13:21\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Right.\\nDeFarm in New York, DeFarm, Desfarm maybe for Americans, DeFarm for people like me who live in France.\\nIn New York they're also doing mentorships.\\nI helped mentor some developers, tried to at least.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Stephan: 00:13:35\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"And so there's a range of possible places that you could be sponsored by or directly employed with.\\nSo you know historical and long-standing examples like Blockstream as we've mentioned, but there are other so Blockstream, Chaincode, MIT, DCI, Spiral as you've mentioned, there's Brink, there's probably a few others that I'm missing.\\nSuper Lunar is a new one and various Bitcoin and crypto exchanges.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Jon: 00:14:02\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Human Rights Foundation, also miners.\\nUnfortunately, they aren't going through a good time right now, but I had a grant for one year from Compass Mining.\\nThank you to them.\\nUnfortunately, they may have been falling on hard times, but in Human Rights Foundation, they receive donations like Brink does and they support people.\\nAnd Alex Gladstein just renewed my grant for another year.\\nSo thanks to them.\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"Individualism vs Mentorship\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Stephan: 00:14:24\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So these are some examples, or in some cases, exchanges will directly sponsor a grant or grantee.\\nSo these are some of the pathways for people out there if you're interested in applying for this kind of thing.\\nI think it'd be good to chat a little bit about mentorship as well.\\nSo I understand for yourself, it seems like you were a little more individual in your own way, but I understand for other people mentorship was very key for them.\\nSo could you just explain a little bit about that?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Jon: 00:14:52\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"You're right.\\nI'm pretty much a free-roaming independent person and I like to self-learn.\\nI've never found it very useful for me to learn in a classroom situation.\\nI'm a self-learner alone, just pounding my head into the material.\\nAnd again, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Chaincode Labs seminars.\\nThey're excellent.\\nIt's a good first step.\\nIf you have any doubt as to whether you would like to join the space, apply.\\nBecause not only will you learn as much, you will get as much back out of it as you give into it.\\nI promise you that.\\nBut it's also, I would say, a talent scouting program disguised as an educational seminar.\\nIn other words, you'll become known in the space just by participating in it.\\nThe people who matter will see who you are and this person maybe needs support, and that's how it happens.\\nI didn't actually apply for any grants ever. \"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Stephan: 00:15:51\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"You kind of got headhunted. \"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Jon: 00:15:52\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Well, that's how it happens.\\nYeah And once you begin, As long as you're doing the work, and this is all really about showing proof of work, it's just like Bitcoin, and once if you continue showing proof of work, people are valuable and needed in this space, and especially experienced people, context is important.\\nThat's one of the things that people may not realize is the longer you stay in the space, the more accumulative context and history you have in your brain.\\nAnd that's a terrible loss for the space when someone stops contributing and has all that context and they leave.\\nSo it's important to keep long-term people so that when someone new comes up with a flashy new idea, hey, I just thought of this, what do you all think?\\nYou're able to say that's not bad.\\nNow, someone proposed that in 2015 and here's what happened, and why it didn't get adopted, and then in 2018 someone else brought it up in a different format, and that almost made it, but I think they got discouraged and dropped their effort.\\nSo that's valuable.\\nYou can apply history and context.\\nAnd so usually, once you get in, it's not too hard to stay in.\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"Value of Long Term Contributors\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Stephan: 00:17:02\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah and I think that's a underrated point around context.\\nSo from every Bitcoin Core developer I've spoken to, it seems that it matters having that longer-term knowledge of what happened before. \\nAnd that's obviously a very useful thing when there are experienced contributors such as yourself and others out there who are longtime contributors who can then share the context about what happened, and perhaps be on the lookout for certain bugs that maybe they have a heightened awareness of.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Jon: 00:17:37\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"It was Adam Jonas at Chaincode who mentioned to me the value of long-term context in history and why it's important to keep long-term contributors.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Stephan: 00:17:55\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Well, a common thing is various Ideas get shared and actually that idea was on Bitcoin talk in 2011.\\nIt's a common thing but then where that idea went and whether it was the right time for that idea?\\nMaybe that's also a question right? \\nSo people might have been speaking about payment channel ideas on BitcoinTalk, but nowadays we have the Lightning Network, which is a network of payment channels, and now it was the right time.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Jon: 00:18:23\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"There is one paradox that will surprise some of you who are considering entering the space and might be finding it forbidding or intimidating.\\nThat paradox is, I'm going to use analogy that I pulled out of my head yesterday at a talk I gave. \\nIt's a bit like the old music industry where the artists are saying man, I can't find a record company to sign me.\\nBut then at the same time, you would talk to the record companies, and they would be like, there's no good artists, we were looking for them, we can't find them.\\nThe point being that, if you show up to a seminar like Chaincode or some of the other ones we've mentioned and you engage with the material, and you do the work, and you really show thoughtful work on it, you will stand out just because you're doing proof of work that is hard to find.\\nThey have trouble finding people willing to engage deeply with the material, the space, the tech, the concepts, and to struggle and engage with them and work on it.\\nThis is rare.\\nIf you're willing to do that, then give it a shot because you're more rare than you realize and they're looking for you.\\nThat's the paradox.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Stephan: 00:19:35\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Do you have any comments on how Bitcoin Core development has shifted over time, if it has?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Jon: 00:19:46\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"One thing that is striking is how fast things change.\\nFor a long time you feel like you're the new person who's struggling, and nobody cares what you have to say, and everything you say feels dumb, and you regret half of the things you write.\\nAnd then in a flick of a second, and all of a sudden people are talking to you differently and you're seen as established.\\nIt's very odd, and it's a bit surprising.\\nYour grants renewed, and suddenly you're sort of an OG, or one of the most experienced remaining contributors on the project because people drop out and leave.\\nThe event that affected me personally the most on Bitcoin Core was the lead maintainer Wladimir van der Laan.\\n10 years he was lead maintainer.\\nI haven't said this here but he was the reason I was inspired originally to work on Bitcoin Core, because I really appreciated his maintainership style.\\nIn addition to being interested in Bitcoin, Wladimir followed me on Twitter maybe three or four years before I began working on Bitcoin Core.\\nAnd I listened to him, and read his tweets, and following how he treated people on Bitcoin Core, which he was lead maintainer of for so long, he was kind, he was humble, service-oriented, he was lifting people up, and I thought that he was just the kind of leader I wanted to work with.\\nAnd I'm honestly very, very sad.\\nIt was time for him to step down he needed to for himself.\\nHe'd been around so long and everyone saw that coming since years, but I think it's a great loss for the project.\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"Dealing with Conflict\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Stephan: 00:21:33\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"In terms of dealing with conflict or contentious things that come up in Bitcoin, do you have any anything you could elaborate or share on that, on how you deal with that?\\nIf there are competing interests, if one party or people want something and the other people don't want that?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Jon: 00:21:55\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes, that's a good question.\\nSome people have different levels of tolerance or appetite for drama.\\nSome devs like to stoke drama on the social networks and others like me aren't too keen on the drama.\\nI've found it helpful to adopt sort of a stoic or Taoist philosophy, at least I try to.\\nIt's helpful to not be the first person to get angry.\\nIt's helpful to read meditations by Marcus Aurelius.\\nAnd I also prefer people who say their position once without flooding over and over again and coming back and attacking anyone who disagrees with them.\\nThere are characters like that in space.\\nThat's not my cup of tea, and that's how I prefer to deal with it.\\nFor example, the mempool full-RBF recent discussions.\\nThere was one person who was flooding all the threads everywhere on all the social networks and on the PR.\\nMy personal opinion is that's, well, maybe they got what they wanted.\\nBut I don't think that's the right way to have the debate.\\nI think people should think carefully, respond when needed.\\nBut It's not always necessary to respond, especially to some sort of low kind of attack or criticism.\\nIf what you've thought and said is your position, that's enough.\\nThat's my position.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Stephan: 00:23:28\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Abstracting away from particular arguments and debates and things.\\nWhat is the right way to reason and debate about these things?\\nAs I understand, there's a preference then for speaking about objective data or reasoned arguments.\\nIs that the right way that people should debate things or what is the right way?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Jon: 00:23:51\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Well in theory this is about rough consensus.\\nRough consensus isn't voting. \\nThere's an article on it written back in the 90s by the internet standards committee back in the day, where rough consensus is humming or something like that, where basically everyone needs to feel heard.\\nAnd I thought it was important on a process like the taproot activation one, which drew out for months and months.\\nBut some people got very upset about that and I wasn't upset at all because in my opinion it was necessary for all the people who had something to say to be able to say it and to feel heard.\\nIt's important for people to feel that validation, okay I was able to get out what I wanted to say.\\nAnd I think that's fine.\\nIf people want to say something, they can.\\nAt the same time, there's a delicate balance.\\nFor example, in the recent mempool full-RBF, there's a whole bunch of people who have, say, an 80 percent understanding of the topic.\\nSome people have a 90 percent, some people maybe a 95 percent.\\nAnd there's maybe two or three people who I would say have a 99.9 percent understanding of the topic.\\nThe deepest, most experienced, long-term, active researchers and contributors in the space, in my opinion, were shouted down, perhaps.\\nPeople weren't listening to the most thoughtful and nuanced discussion, necessarily.\\nMaybe they were.\\nThat's just my impression.\\nMy opinion is we shouldn't break things if we don't need to.\\nWe should be careful.\\nBut I'm not one of the young fiery contributors.\\nI believe we should be prudent and reasonable.\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"Community Discustions About Bitcoin Core\"},

more of a generalist.\\nThere's not a part of the codebase that I'm not willing to try to review and to learn about.\\nAnd it's kind of cool that moment when you open up a file that you've never looked at before, which in Bitcoin Core is easily possible for a very long time.\\nYeah, it depends on you.\\nI like to roam.\\nAt the same time, there are certain parts of the codebase I spend much more time on than others.\\nSo it's just up to you.\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"Contributing a Change\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Stephan: 00:28:29\"},

{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah, it's hard for me to know how familiar people are with that process, but if someone opens a pull request and then people review the change on a conceptual level

amount of review is necessary depending on the change and how critical it is, if it touches consensus or not. \\nSome changes are really low risk other ones are high risk.\\nSo in theory were I a maintainer I would probably want to see much more review on a critical piece of code than on a non-critical one.\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"Robustness and Decentralization\"},

speaking in general terms, but that's what it is.\\nI think Bitcoin might be the last one standing apart from any captured coins thanks to its decentralization, but it's not as decentralized as it could be, and I would hope for it to become more decentralized in the future, and on all levels including the core development level.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Stephan: 00:30:41\"},

the code base as robust as it possibly can be, and finding and fixing bugs.\\nSometimes they're not talked about.\\nSometimes they're fixed in a way that people don't see.\\nThis to me is more important than adding new features, but that's personal other people have a project, this person is supposed to implement this BIP, this person is supposed to bring this into the project, and that's fine.\\nAnd generally I see my role is reviewing those things.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Stephan: 00:32:01\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"And I think it's fair to point out that

suppose there are, even on Bitcoin Core, there are people with a different focus.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Jon: 00:32:31\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I'm not against new

got to dig down and do it.\\nAnd depending on who you know, maybe it will go faster or go slower, but proof of work is something that in the end, I think, rises to the top and is visible.\\nSo that's basically if you want to be a core developer or work on Bitcoin or Lightning, I highly recommend the Chaincode Lab seminars or any of the other initiatives.\\nThat's the best possible way to begin that I can think of.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Stephan: 00:34:18\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Great, well everyone give Jon a round of applause.\\nThank you.\\nSo we've got a

{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Thanks very much for your talk, it was enlightening.\\nYou mentioned about being funded to work on Bitcoin Core through a grant.\\nI just wondered if you could say a

00:35:51\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"If I understand correctly, you're asking how high are the grants?\\nIn terms of financial terms.\\nGenerally, it depends on the grant structure.\\nSome offer you the ability to be paid all in Bitcoin, some all in dollars or even a choice of half and half.\\nI've often had the choice of all three, USD or Bitcoin or half and half.\\nI would say that it's less than a big Silicon Valley salary.\\nBut nothing's stopping you from applying to several sponsors to accumulate them if you so desire.\\nI didn't do that at first.\\nAnd after I did begin talking to a few others, that turned out to be a good thing to do, in my case, because at one point I had three instead of one, and now I currently have two.\\nI don't worry about it as much as maybe I should because I like to stay focused on the work and not on the money.\\nBecause I find that thinking about the money doesn't isn't conducive to being productive on the on the focus on the work itself.\\nBut that's just me.\\nI would say that if you're young, it's very interesting financially once you begin.\\nIf you are a bit older with say mortgages and a family to support, it's a bit more difficult, but it's not impossible.\\nIt depends on what you're used to and where you live.\\nFor example, I don't believe that they're geo-adjusting the grants.\\nFor example, Spiral offers the same grant amount to everyone and then it's up to you to geo-arbitrage if you need to.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Audience: 00:37:30\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Okay, thank you.\"},

excellent question.\\nSo first of all, I think it's good to remind ourselves that Bitcoin Core isn't a closed team.\\nIt's an open source project that anybody can provide feedback on.\\nAnd feedback

they comment directly on the PR?\\nWell, I understand that it can be intimidating to do so, and also, they're busy, they may be not have the time to go in and review and say something that they're unafraid to say on the pull request, it's intimidating.\\nI get that but it's open to everyone I encourage businesses and merchants to get involved.\\nAs we recently saw with the Muun Wallet and Dario

    "body": "## Introduction\n\nHost: 00:00:00\n\nNow we are going to have a panel conversation; a kind of fireside chat between Stephan Livera and Jon Atack and the name is how to get started contributing sustainably to Bitcoin Core so if you are a dev and are looking to start to contribute to Bitcoin Core, this is your talk.\n\nStephan: 00:00:32\n\nOkay, so thank you for having us and thank you for joining us.\nJoining me today is Jon Atack.\nHe is a Bitcoin Core developer, contributor.\nHe started about two or three years ago, roughly?\n\nJon: 00:00:47\n\nMarch 2019.\nHello, everybody.\nGood to see you.\nThree and a half years now already, time goes fast.\nWe haven't seen each other since three years at the Lightning Conf in Berlin.\n\nStephan 00:01:01: \n\nOctober 2019.\n\nJon: 00:01:02\n\nYeah, we met and at that point I'd been working on Bitcoin Core since seven months.\n\n## Jon's Background and Motivation\n\nStephan: 00:01:06\n\nLet's get into this today.\nWe're gonna chat a little bit about your journey and offer some insights for people here, or anyone on the stream, if they are thinking about what it's like being a Bitcoin Core contributor, and if they want to get involved, how they would do this.\nTell us a little bit about your motivation.\nWhy did you want to go down this pathway?\n\nJon: 00:01:27\n\nThat's a great question.\nSo I'd have been aware of Bitcoin since several years before I began, and I had in the back of my mind the goal that someday I would stop taking freelance missions.\nI was a freelance software developer working for large corporations, saving their ass on missions that they were in trouble with, and the whole time I was thinking, I'm saving up money, I'm stacking, and someday I'm gonna quit this and I'm going to work on Bitcoin.\nIt was an idea I had, years beforehand, and something has to happen to kind of kick you in the rear, and to kick-start you into doing it, and that something for me was totally unplanned.\nIt was end of February 2019, on Twitter, I saw Chaincode labs saying last minute to apply for the summer residency at Chaincode Labs this summer.\nIn 2019, Chaincode Labs did a very large residency program.\nIt was very ambitious, and at the last minute, I think 20 minutes before midnight when the applications closed, I submitted a proposal to join the seminar as a resident.\nI was not accepted.\nBut this is where the story becomes interesting.\nThey did take me for a first round interview.\nThey said, okay, we don't know who you are.\nYou haven't done anything in the space yet, but we encourage you to try and apply later, maybe to the next residency.\nI thought, okay.\nTwo weeks went by and then finally I thought, nah, I'm just gonna start now.\nAnd I started trying to contribute on my own, I would say half time.\nAnd two weeks after that, I got a call from Chaincode Labs saying, ah, you're active on Bitcoin Core and it's interesting.\nWould you like a phone call with John Newberry to mentor you? I said, sure.\nAnd we did a phone call and I was like, whoa, this is ambitious.\nHe's setting the bar like up there.\nI kept doing what I could and I was not in the residency, but one week before the program began, Chaincode Labs called again and said, okay, you've been doing this since March and now we're late May, would you like to come to New York?\nAnd so I did end up going to Chaincode Labs, even though they said no.\n\n[jonatack.github.io](https://jonatack.github.io/)\n\n## The Grant Process\n\nStephan: 00:03:49\n\nThat's a great story.\nAnd I think what has happened over time, because I know part of your story is that you were working unpaid, right?\nYou were doing this just because you believed in it.\nAnd so then there was also a journey of trying to get sponsorship or grant money or funding to sustain yourself.\nSo could you explain a little bit about that process?\nBecause I think listeners will be interested.\n\nJon: 00:04:17\n\nRight, so basically when I began in 2019 it was brutal.\nIt was the bottom of the bear market, the previous bear market, and at that time none of the currently existing funding structures were in place.\nYour only options were to be hired by Blockstream or Chaincode Labs.\n\nStephan: 00:04:40\n\nMIT DCI maybe.\n\nJon: 00:04:41\n\nYeah, but they didn't have these grants that are very prevalent now and the situation is much better now, much easier.\nReally, you need to show proof of work.\nYou need to show up humbly, you gotta stay humble.\nYou're gonna learn a lot, you're gonna fall down a lot, and you need to try to add value while respecting other people's time and being humble about it, you're gonna make lots of mistakes.\nThere's so much accumulated context and experience that the long-term contributors have that a newcomer will not, but that doesn't mean you can't provide value if you're careful about it, and thoughtful, and take the time.\nIt took me literally, back then, one year to be funded.\nThank you to Jack Dorsey who created Square Crypto, now since renamed Spiral.\nI didn't actually do anything to get a grant.\nYou are just showing proof of work and after a while people will push grantees to...\nI suppose nowadays you can apply for grants with a project. \nBut I never had a project. \nMy only project was to review and to contribute and to fix things that I saw.  \nI never had a project dropped into my lap. \nLike I'm going to implement this, I'm going to do fedimint, or I'm going to do you know payjoin, or joinmarket or BIP324 implementation or BIP155 implementation.\nI never had anything like that.\nAll I did was review and basically do the things that no one else wanted to do, but that needed to be done, like reviewing and testing and fixing things.\nAnd after a while, that worked.\nIt took me a long time.\nIt was pretty hard.\n\n## Different Ways to Contribute to Bitcoin Core\n\nStephan: 00:06:24\n\nSo for the layman audience who don't understand the nuances of software development and Bitcoin Core, can you explain the difference between writing a pull request, making some new code for Bitcoin Core and doing that other role that you was mentioning, the review, the testing?\n\nJon: 00:06:41\n\nRight, I think that gets back to what does a Bitcoin Core developer do and I think it doesn't correspond to the image that most people have of what we're actually doing.\nI would say most of the time what we're doing is reading code, reading other people's ideas and thinking and maybe testing and reviewing.\nIn my case, there's very little coding.\nI was a full-time software engineer from quite a long time before, where you basically you just churn out the code, and check off the boxes as fast as you can during your current sprint, before the next sprint starts. \nBitcoin Core is is different.\nYou have to be more patient.  \nThere's more thinking going on and nuance and things don't always go quickly.\nIt depends on what it is.\nSo I would say the most important role in Bitcoin Core and what is most lacking is review and testing.\nIt's not coding and also spending time thinking through what other people are saying, testing, verifying.\nOkay, maybe they're right.\nMaybe they're wrong.\nYou need to come to these conclusions and pretty much you do it on your own.\nWell I've always worked alone.\nSome people work in large organizations, some people work at Spiral, some people work at Chaincode, some people work at Blockstream.\nBut even Blockstream, they only support one Bitcoin Core developer, Andrew Chow, and I believe he works mostly alone unless you travel into an office.\nSo a lot of it is just alone time with a code, reading things, reading the mailing list, coming to your conclusions.\n\nStephan: 00:08:17\n\nSo going on from that, could you maybe outline as an example where some of the discussion takes place and then where the interaction back and forth with other developers happens?\n\nJon: 00:08:41\n\nThe interaction happens either on the Bitcoin Core Dev IRC channel or on the pull request on GitHub, generally, and occasionally on the mailing list.\nThose are the three areas.\nAnother thing that core developers do is educate.\nThey don't only work on Bitcoin Core, they might review and help write for Bitcoin Optics Weekly Newsletter.\nI did that for two years.\nI see Murch is in the room.\nHe's currently on the Bitcoin Optech team.\nThey also perhaps help run the Bitcoin Core PR Review Club, which I also did for two years.\nThese are annex activities that many core developers do in addition to working only on Bitcoin Core.\n\nStephan: 00:09:24\n\nOne other area that I think is interesting, and I know you mentioned this to me offline.\nSo with Bitcoin Core, as I understand, most of the code is in C++ and a lot of the testing is in Python.\nBut you mentioned that you actually had to learn this as part of your process.\nCan you elaborate a bit?\n\nJon: 00:09:42\n\n\nCorrect.\nSo Satoshi Nakamoto wrote in C++.\nAnd the functional test suite is in Python.\nNow, before I'd arrived, I had not coded in either one.\nI'd had C back in my college days.\nBut my personal work experience was we're in completely different languages.\nAssembly and web development in Ruby and Ruby on Rails, for example.\nSo, yeah, but if I can do it, I think anyone can.\nI arrived and I taught myself C++ while doing it.\nPython came quickly because it's similar to Ruby.\nBut yeah, it's not impossible for you to show up and to learn these two languages and become a core developer if that is your goal.\nNote that there isn't just Bitcoin Core and I think that's important to underline.\nThere are many other valuable projects in the space besides Bitcoin Core.  \nThere are wallets, miners, lightning implementations, lightning development, specification, bolts, BIPs.\nThere are many super valuable projects.\nIt doesn't have to be Bitcoin Core and even it doesn't have to be open source, you could work on closed source.\nThere's lots of jobs out there now for Bitcoin Developers, and it doesn't just have to be a developer, you could also find a place for yourself if you're a product manager, a designer, a writer, we need people like that in the space.\nMaybe not on Bitcoin Core, which is just developers, but in other areas.\nOr you could become a startup founder.\nThere are more and more VCs who are willing to fund Bitcoin and now lightning startups.\n\nStephan: 00:11:18\n\nSo could you elaborate a little bit in terms of non-developer contributions?\nSo let's say somebody's out there, they're interested to get involved.\nMaybe they're not quite a developer, but they are, let's say, tech savvy and interested to contribute.\nWhat are some ways that they could do that?\n\nJon: 00:11:34\n\nWell, for example, I believe that Spiral, who was my first sponsor and still a sponsor of mine, I believe that they're quite interested in finding product managers because a good product manager can have a lot of impact by leveraging their work through developers and designers.\nAnd I think they're very happy with the one or two product managers they do currently support and might be interested in more.\nI don't know if I answered your question.\n\nStephan: 00:12:04\n\nYeah, that's one example.\nAnd I know even some other open source projects are looking for translators as an example.\nSo literally no coding, just literally someone who can translate and make that wallet or that software accessible in other languages.\n\nJon: 00:12:19\n\nThere was a period of about two years when Spiral was also giving grants to a lot of designers.\nI don't know if they're doing that so much currently because we are unfortunately in a bear market, but you can always apply.\nIf you research it, you'll find that there are many funding organizations now, especially compared to four years ago when I began.\nBut the first step isn't to apply for a grant unless you're already well established in the space.\nThe first step is to apply to Chaincode Labs online seminar, either Bitcoin or Lightning, or Summer of Bitcoin, or a number of other excellent programs that are up and coming to educate people in space \n\nStephan: 00:13:00 \n\n\nRight and yesterday on the same stage we had some other organizations like Vinteum, Library of Satoshi, and Torogoz as well.\nSo these are some other organizations that you can potentially...\n\nJon: 00:13:12\n\nI believe there's one that's being started by Marina Spindler, I can't remember the name, for El Salvador focused.\n\nStephan: 00:13:19\n\nThat's Torogoz.\n\nJon: 00:13:21\n\nRight.\nDeFarm in New York, DeFarm, Desfarm maybe for Americans, DeFarm for people like me who live in France.\nIn New York they're also doing mentorships.\nI helped mentor some developers, tried to at least.\n\nStephan: 00:13:35\n\nAnd so there's a range of possible places that you could be sponsored by or directly employed with.\nSo you know historical and long-standing examples like Blockstream as we've mentioned, but there are other so Blockstream, Chaincode, MIT, DCI, Spiral as you've mentioned, there's Brink, there's probably a few others that I'm missing.\nSuper Lunar is a new one and various Bitcoin and crypto exchanges.\n\nJon: 00:14:02\n\nHuman Rights Foundation, also miners.\nUnfortunately, they aren't going through a good time right now, but I had a grant for one year from Compass Mining.\nThank you to them.\nUnfortunately, they may have been falling on hard times, but in Human Rights Foundation, they receive donations like Brink does and they support people.\nAnd Alex Gladstein just renewed my grant for another year.\nSo thanks to them.\n\n## Individualism vs Mentorship\n\nStephan: 00:14:24\n\nSo these are some examples, or in some cases, exchanges will directly sponsor a grant or grantee.\nSo these are some of the pathways for people out there if you're interested in applying for this kind of thing.\nI think it'd be good to chat a little bit about mentorship as well.\nSo I understand for yourself, it seems like you were a little more individual in your own way, but I understand for other people mentorship was very key for them.\nSo could you just explain a little bit about that?\n\nJon: 00:14:52\n\nYou're right.\nI'm pretty much a free-roaming independent person and I like to self-learn.\nI've never found it very useful for me to learn in a classroom situation.\nI'm a self-learner alone, just pounding my head into the material.\nAnd again, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Chaincode Labs seminars.\nThey're excellent.\nIt's a good first step.\nIf you have any doubt as to whether you would like to join the space, apply.\nBecause not only will you learn as much, you will get as much back out of it as you give into it.\nI promise you that.\nBut it's also, I would say, a talent scouting program disguised as an educational seminar.\nIn other words, you'll become known in the space just by participating in it.\nThe people who matter will see who you are and this person maybe needs support, and that's how it happens.\nI didn't actually apply for any grants ever. \n\nStephan: 00:15:51\n\nYou kind of got headhunted. \n\nJon: 00:15:52\n\nWell, that's how it happens.\nYeah And once you begin, As long as you're doing the work, and this is all really about showing proof of work, it's just like Bitcoin, and once if you continue showing proof of work, people are valuable and needed in this space, and especially experienced people, context is important.\nThat's one of the things that people may not realize is the longer you stay in the space, the more accumulative context and history you have in your brain.\nAnd that's a terrible loss for the space when someone stops contributing and has all that context and they leave.\nSo it's important to keep long-term people so that when someone new comes up with a flashy new idea, hey, I just thought of this, what do you all think?\nYou're able to say that's not bad.\nNow, someone proposed that in 2015 and here's what happened, and why it didn't get adopted, and then in 2018 someone else brought it up in a different format, and that almost made it, but I think they got discouraged and dropped their effort.\nSo that's valuable.\nYou can apply history and context.\nAnd so usually, once you get in, it's not too hard to stay in.\n\n## Value of Long Term Contributors\n\nStephan: 00:17:02\n\nYeah and I think that's a underrated point around context.\nSo from every Bitcoin Core developer I've spoken to, it seems that it matters having that longer-term knowledge of what happened before. \nAnd that's obviously a very useful thing when there are experienced contributors such as yourself and others out there who are longtime contributors who can then share the context about what happened, and perhaps be on the lookout for certain bugs that maybe they have a heightened awareness of.\n\nJon: 00:17:37\n\nIt was Adam Jonas at Chaincode who mentioned to me the value of long-term context in history and why it's important to keep long-term contributors.\n\nStephan: 00:17:55\n\nWell, a common thing is various Ideas get shared and actually that idea was on Bitcoin talk in 2011.\nIt's a common thing but then where that idea went and whether it was the right time for that idea?\nMaybe that's also a question right? \nSo people might have been speaking about payment channel ideas on BitcoinTalk, but nowadays we have the Lightning Network, which is a network of payment channels, and now it was the right time.\n\nJon: 00:18:23\n\nThere is one paradox that will surprise some of you who are considering entering the space and might be finding it forbidding or intimidating.\nThat paradox is, I'm going to use analogy that I pulled out of my head yesterday at a talk I gave. \nIt's a bit like the old music industry where the artists are saying man, I can't find a record company to sign me.\nBut then at the same time, you would talk to the record companies, and they would be like, there's no good artists, we were looking for them, we can't find them.\nThe point being that, if you show up to a seminar like Chaincode or some of the other ones we've mentioned and you engage with the material, and you do the work, and you really show thoughtful work on it, you will stand out just because you're doing proof of work that is hard to find.\nThey have trouble finding people willing to engage deeply with the material, the space, the tech, the concepts, and to struggle and engage with them and work on it.\nThis is rare.\nIf you're willing to do that, then give it a shot because you're more rare than you realize and they're looking for you.\nThat's the paradox.\n\nStephan: 00:19:35\n\nDo you have any comments on how Bitcoin Core development has shifted over time, if it has?\n\nJon: 00:19:46\n\nOne thing that is striking is how fast things change.\nFor a long time you feel like you're the new person who's struggling, and nobody cares what you have to say, and everything you say feels dumb, and you regret half of the things you write.\nAnd then in a flick of a second, and all of a sudden people are talking to you differently and you're seen as established.\nIt's very odd, and it's a bit surprising.\nYour grants renewed, and suddenly you're sort of an OG, or one of the most experienced remaining contributors on the project because people drop out and leave.\nThe event that affected me personally the most on Bitcoin Core was the lead maintainer Wladimir van der Laan.\n10 years he was lead maintainer.\nI haven't said this here but he was the reason I was inspired originally to work on Bitcoin Core, because I really appreciated his maintainership style.\nIn addition to being interested in Bitcoin, Wladimir followed me on Twitter maybe three or four years before I began working on Bitcoin Core.\nAnd I listened to him, and read his tweets, and following how he treated people on Bitcoin Core, which he was lead maintainer of for so long, he was kind, he was humble, service-oriented, he was lifting people up, and I thought that he was just the kind of leader I wanted to work with.\nAnd I'm honestly very, very sad.\nIt was time for him to step down he needed to for himself.\nHe'd been around so long and everyone saw that coming since years, but I think it's a great loss for the project.\n\n## Dealing with Conflict\n\nStephan: 00:21:33\n\nIn terms of dealing with conflict or contentious things that come up in Bitcoin, do you have any anything you could elaborate or share on that, on how you deal with that?\nIf there are competing interests, if one party or people want something and the other people don't want that?\n\nJon: 00:21:55\n\nYes, that's a good question.\nSome people have different levels of tolerance or appetite for drama.\nSome devs like to stoke drama on the social networks and others like me aren't too keen on the drama.\nI've found it helpful to adopt sort of a stoic or Taoist philosophy, at least I try to.\nIt's helpful to not be the first person to get angry.\nIt's helpful to read meditations by Marcus Aurelius.\nAnd I also prefer people who say their position once without flooding over and over again and coming back and attacking anyone who disagrees with them.\nThere are characters like that in space.\nThat's not my cup of tea, and that's how I prefer to deal with it.\nFor example, the mempool full-RBF recent discussions.\nThere was one person who was flooding all the threads everywhere on all the social networks and on the PR.\nMy personal opinion is that's, well, maybe they got what they wanted.\nBut I don't think that's the right way to have the debate.\nI think people should think carefully, respond when needed.\nBut It's not always necessary to respond, especially to some sort of low kind of attack or criticism.\nIf what you've thought and said is your position, that's enough.\nThat's my position.\n\nStephan: 00:23:28\n\nAbstracting away from particular arguments and debates and things.\nWhat is the right way to reason and debate about these things?\nAs I understand, there's a preference then for speaking about objective data or reasoned arguments.\nIs that the right way that people should debate things or what is the right way?\n\nJon: 00:23:51\n\nWell in theory this is about rough consensus.\nRough consensus isn't voting. \nThere's an article on it written back in the 90s by the internet standards committee back in the day, where rough consensus is humming or something like that, where basically everyone needs to feel heard.\nAnd I thought it was important on a process like the taproot activation one, which drew out for months and months.\nBut some people got very upset about that and I wasn't upset at all because in my opinion it was necessary for all the people who had something to say to be able to say it and to feel heard.\nIt's important for people to feel that validation, okay I was able to get out what I wanted to say.\nAnd I think that's fine.\nIf people want to say something, they can.\nAt the same time, there's a delicate balance.\nFor example, in the recent mempool full-RBF, there's a whole bunch of people who have, say, an 80 percent understanding of the topic.\nSome people have a 90 percent, some people maybe a 95 percent.\nAnd there's maybe two or three people who I would say have a 99.9 percent understanding of the topic.\nThe deepest, most experienced, long-term, active researchers and contributors in the space, in my opinion, were shouted down, perhaps.\nPeople weren't listening to the most thoughtful and nuanced discussion, necessarily.\nMaybe they were.\nThat's just my impression.\nMy opinion is we shouldn't break things if we don't need to.\nWe should be careful.\nBut I'm not one of the young fiery contributors.\nI believe we should be prudent and reasonable.\n\n## Community Discustions About Bitcoin Core\n\nStephan: 00:25:30\n\nI think that's a fair approach to take.\nCan we chat a little bit about some of the various ways that people skill up.\nOne good example would be [Bitcoin Core Review Club](https://bitcoincore.reviews/).\nCan you tell us a little bit about that and why that's useful for people?\n\nJon: 00:25:47\n\nRight, Bitcoin Core PR Review Club is an excellent initiative, again by John Newberry, who's done a number of excellent initiatives.\nHe also was the founder of Brink.\nI highly recommend, if you want to get involved, participating in the Review Club sessions online on IRC every Wednesday, preparing the sessions.  [Bitcoin IRC Channels Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/IRC_channels)\nThe more you prepare, the more you give, the more you'll get and learn.\nAnd eventually, hosting some sessions.\nBecause nothing is more scary than the preparation to feel you're capable and competent enough to host a session about something.\nHighly recommended.\n\nStephan: 00:26:26\n\nAnd so that seems to be one good tool or way to skill up on things.\nI understand other people use things like Socratic seminars.\nThat's another way that people try to learn by asking Socratic questioning of each other.\nAnd there's mailing list discussion as well and of course GitHub, the comments on the pull requests.\nSo could you just elaborate a little bit on some of those methods of the discussion and learning that can take place?\n\nJon: 00:26:54\n\nFirst of all, you reminded me to say I highly recommend subscribing by email to the [Bitcoin Optech Newsletters](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/).\nThey're written by Dave Harding every week with a competent team of reviewers, of which I did that for two years, and wrote articles as well.\nIt's a great way to keep up with developments in the space.\nSubscribe to the mailing list.\nAnd I've already forgotten your question.\n\nStephan: 00:27:17\n\nIf you could just elaborate a bit on that discussion.\nI think you already were and I know there's an IRC chat as well, and I think that's shifted now \n\nJon: 00:27:32\n\nDefinitely follow the IRC discussions in whatever project that you're working on.\nThere are IRC channels for lnd, c-lightning, Lightning Protocol Development, Bitcoin Core Dev.\nAll the projects, JoinMarket, they all have IRC channels.\n\n## Specialization vs Generalization\n\nStephan: 00:27:45\n\nNow I know also, it can vary, but some bitcoin core contributors have an area that they are a specialist in, whether that's the wallet or whether it's different aspects of that. \nDo you have an area that you you would consider yourself a specialist or do you consider yourself more like a generalist?\n\nJon: 00:28:04\n\nI'm definitely more of a generalist.\nThere's not a part of the codebase that I'm not willing to try to review and to learn about.\nAnd it's kind of cool that moment when you open up a file that you've never looked at before, which in Bitcoin Core is easily possible for a very long time.\nYeah, it depends on you.\nI like to roam.\nAt the same time, there are certain parts of the codebase I spend much more time on than others.\nSo it's just up to you.\n\n## Contributing a Change\n\nStephan: 00:28:29\n\nSo let's talk a little bit about that process, maybe for people who aren't as familiar.\nWhat does it look like then, that process of a person, let's say, contributing some kind of change, review for that, and maintainer?\nIf you could just talk through that process.\n\nJon: 00:28:47\n\nYeah, it's hard for me to know how familiar people are with that process, but if someone opens a pull request and then people review the change on a conceptual level or on a code review level, it suggests changes and the process moves forward.\nWhen there is enough approval by the reviewers, then it might be merged.\nSome different kind of review and different amount of review is necessary depending on the change and how critical it is, if it touches consensus or not. \nSome changes are really low risk other ones are high risk.\nSo in theory were I a maintainer I would probably want to see much more review on a critical piece of code than on a non-critical one.\n\n## Robustness and Decentralization\n\nStephan: 00:29:34\n\nIs there anything in terms of the broader Bitcoin ecosystem that you're excited about or that you would like to see, whether it's lightning or some other thing, are there any aspects of that that you are particularly interested to see?\n\nJon: 00:29:50\n\nMy main goal is for Bitcoin Core to be robust because failing it being robust, it's hard to build on it and it's decentralization.\nSo most of my concerns are if there's some failure that we can see or some area that isn't as robust as it could be, it's the base layer, so it needs to be really solid.\nAnd the second key point is decentralization.\nSo I'm speaking in general terms, but that's what it is.\nI think Bitcoin might be the last one standing apart from any captured coins thanks to its decentralization, but it's not as decentralized as it could be, and I would hope for it to become more decentralized in the future, and on all levels including the core development level.\n\nStephan: 00:30:41\n\nAnd it's right to say that there's been a focus on that even amongst developers.\nI think one other area, maybe this is like an observation, that sometimes when you're talking to people who are known for let's say evangelizing Bitcoin, they will speak in this kind of, oh it's inevitable sort of sense.\nBut then when you talk to somebody who's a core developer, contributor, and they're closer to the code.\nThey're a lot less inevitable, let's say.\nSo could you just elaborate a bit on that?\n\nJon: 00:31:09\n\nYeah, well we see how the sausage is made, warts and all, and there's a lot of things that could be improved that no one on the outside will necessarily notice that it has been changed.\nAnd yet, these are, in my opinion, the most important things.\nI'm not talking about refactoring or making the code cleaner or prettier, I'm talking about making the code base as robust as it possibly can be, and finding and fixing bugs.\nSometimes they're not talked about.\nSometimes they're fixed in a way that people don't see.\nThis to me is more important than adding new features, but that's personal other people have a project, this person is supposed to implement this BIP, this person is supposed to bring this into the project, and that's fine.\nAnd generally I see my role is reviewing those things.\n\nStephan: 00:32:01\n\nAnd I think it's fair to point out that there are debates even amongst the community about how much change Bitcoin should have right, I don't want to get too political, but it's almost like a similarity of like progressives and conservatives.\nYou have like people who just say no, just focus on the reliability and then maybe there are other people who have let's say this big new feature, that they that they want.\nAnd so I suppose there are, even on Bitcoin Core, there are people with a different focus.\n\nJon: 00:32:31\n\nI'm not against new features at all.\nThey're not necessarily my priority, but I'm happy to review them.\nSometimes we break things without realizing it.\nIt's easy to think something's safe and it breaks something, and it's noticed only later.\nSo, what we need more than anything is review and testing.\nAnd even if you're not a C++ expert, you can still test.\nYou can test the release.\nYou can test the areas that you're interested in that you use in Bitcoin, in the new release, or even in not a new release, but the release you're using, and report anything you find in a way that makes it possible for us to reproduce what you found.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\n\nStephan: 00:33:18\n\nSo let's leave it here with a few tips and then we can maybe open up for questions.\nSo, if you had any closing thoughts and tips for people out there, whether they want to become a Bitcoin Core contributor themselves, or whether they just want to have an awareness of the process, what are some things that you think people should know?\n\nJon: 00:33:38\n\nWell the number one thing if you want to become a developer or something else in the space, in my opinion, is to show proof of work.\nIt's as simple as that.\nYou got to dig down and do it.\nAnd depending on who you know, maybe it will go faster or go slower, but proof of work is something that in the end, I think, rises to the top and is visible.\nSo that's basically if you want to be a core developer or work on Bitcoin or Lightning, I highly recommend the Chaincode Lab seminars or any of the other initiatives.\nThat's the best possible way to begin that I can think of.\n\nStephan: 00:34:18\n\nGreat, well everyone give Jon a round of applause.\nThank you.\nSo we've got a few minutes for questions, so we can probably take two or three questions.\nSo can we just get a runner, down the back I think was first.\n\n## Audience Questions\n\nAudience: 00:34:40\n\nSo yeah, we got Bitcoin Core... in your humble opinion should anyone even bother with btcd or other implementations.\nAs far as contributing to Bitcoin Core, is it worth looking at the other implementations as well?\n\nJon: 00:35:00\n\nThat's up to you.\nI don't want to tell people what to do.\nDo what you like.\n\nStephan: 00:35:12\n\nNext question, anyone?\nWe've got one at the second row here.\n\nAudience: 00:35:20\n\nThanks very much for your talk, it was enlightening.\nYou mentioned about being funded to work on Bitcoin Core through a grant.\nI just wondered if you could say a little bit more about those grants and what kind of level are they at?\nHow does that compare to salaries in big tech for senior professionals?\n\nJon: 00:35:51\n\nIf I understand correctly, you're asking how high are the grants?\nIn terms of financial terms.\nGenerally, it depends on the grant structure.\nSome offer you the ability to be paid all in Bitcoin, some all in dollars or even a choice of half and half.\nI've often had the choice of all three, USD or Bitcoin or half and half.\nI would say that it's less than a big Silicon Valley salary.\nBut nothing's stopping you from applying to several sponsors to accumulate them if you so desire.\nI didn't do that at first.\nAnd after I did begin talking to a few others, that turned out to be a good thing to do, in my case, because at one point I had three instead of one, and now I currently have two.\nI don't worry about it as much as maybe I should because I like to stay focused on the work and not on the money.\nBecause I find that thinking about the money doesn't isn't conducive to being productive on the on the focus on the work itself.\nBut that's just me.\nI would say that if you're young, it's very interesting financially once you begin.\nIf you are a bit older with say mortgages and a family to support, it's a bit more difficult, but it's not impossible.\nIt depends on what you're used to and where you live.\nFor example, I don't believe that they're geo-adjusting the grants.\nFor example, Spiral offers the same grant amount to everyone and then it's up to you to geo-arbitrage if you need to.\n\nAudience: 00:37:30\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nStephan: 00:37:32\n\nWe've got time for one more.\nWe've got Jon over there \n\nAudience: 00:37:33\n\nI really appreciate your comment about people wanting to be heard in the process.\nWhat do you think is the best way for not only users and merchants to actually be heard but also feel heard in the process while they are not actually part of core engineers or really familiar with the culture of how to interface With that community.\nWhat do you think is the best way for these outsiders yet still bitcoiners to be heard and feel heard?\n\nJon: 00:38:16\n\nOkay, that's an excellent question.\nSo first of all, I think it's good to remind ourselves that Bitcoin Core isn't a closed team.\nIt's an open source project that anybody can provide feedback on.\nAnd feedback is welcomed.\nAnd for example, just yesterday I reported a large Bitcoin financial company has some minor issues with the upcoming release and I reported it.\nAnd they were like, well, why didn't they comment directly on the PR?\nWell, I understand that it can be intimidating to do so, and also, they're busy, they may be not have the time to go in and review and say something that they're unafraid to say on the pull request, it's intimidating.\nI get that but it's open to everyone I encourage businesses and merchants to get involved.\nAs we recently saw with the Muun Wallet and Dario and others on the mailing list and on pull requests, there is a productive and less productive way to be giving feedback, so I would suggest giving feedback, but doing so productively, in a positive way, but yes, please do give feedback.\nPeople want to see that.\nWe shouldn't be in our own little ivory tower, breaking things downstream for people without even realizing it.\nWe need that feedback.\nI think it's very important to keep the core devs' feet on the ground, and I say that to myself.\nI want to keep my feet on the ground.\nAnd it is an issue because there is a tendency to say, give high respect to people who are just really deep in the code, but who actually maybe, you know, it works in theory, but not necessarily in practice.\nSo please do provide feedback, and do so in a conducive and constructive way.\nIt's very helpful.\nThanks.\nAnd you certainly can.\nAnyone is welcome to.\nLast 30 seconds.\n\nStephan: 00:40:17\n\nOne up the back there.\nGot to keep it quick, though, or we might run over.\n\nAudience: 00:40:25\n\nWhat would you say is the main reason that people leave?\n\nStephan: 00:40:29\n\nWhat would you say is the main reason people leave?\nI believe Bitcoin Core, is that what you're saying?\n\nJon: 00:40:34\n\nThat's a great question, why do people leave?\nWorking on Bitcoin Core is particularly frustrating, I believe.\nIt can take you years to have changes merged or even never merged.\nYou can work a lot and hard on something that takes a lot of your time, only to at the last minute have it not worked out because someone finds a really good reason why it shouldn't take place.\nThe review can be brutal.\nAlso some aspects are not necessarily fun.\nIt's a little bit like high school.\nIn some ways it feels like there's popularity comes into question.\nAnd all these things sort of combine to burn people out.\nAnd there's also the high stakes.\nFor example the discussion on the social media really burns people out.\nI've had feedback from people who've left recently that you know all the talk about Bitcoin fixes the world, or Bitcoin boils the oceans, or why didn't you stand up to CSW and assassinate him yourself like you're some kind of ninja and not just the developer.\nYou know people have these really crazy expectations of core devs.\nWe're just humans.\nWe're just developers and we need to focus on our work.\nAnd we're not necessarily here to argue with every single person and spar debate with them online about whether Bitcoin is boiling the oceans, and whether it's fixes the wars, and whether it does this, and whether it does that.\nWe're just trying to do our work.\nAnd so this gets to people.\nIt gets under their skin even if it shouldn't.\nAnd of course the Craig Wright things really burn people out because you're a potential target.\nWe're all one lawsuit away from deep stress.\nSo, yeah.\nThese things sort of do eat at you for a while over time.\nAnd as much as you try to push them aside and focus just on working on Bitcoin Core, they do get under your skin after.\n\nStephan: 00:42:33\n\nYeah.\nWell, all right, everybody, put your hands together for Jon.\nThank you, Jon.\nWoo, woo, woo, woo, woo,\n\nHost: 00:42:40\n\nYes, yes, yes.\n\nJon: 00:42:42\n\nThanks everybody.\n\nHost: 00:42:45\n\nAll right.\nSo, let's keep it going and remember to share your pictures, tweets, memes or anything that you want to share in social media using the adopting BTC hashtag, so people could join and see all the experience that we already have in here in adopting.\n\n",

    "summary": "In an enlightening discussion between Jon Atack and Stephan Livera, the intricacies of Bitcoin Core development were explored, shedding light on the journey of contributors and the multifaceted challenges they face. Jon Atack shares his transition from a freelance software developer to a key figure in Bitcoin Core development, sparked by his application to Chaincode Labs' residency program. Despite initial rejection, his persistent contributions led to an invitation, illustrating the unpredictable path to becoming a core contributor. This narrative underscores the importance of perseverance and the often overlooked aspects of development such as code review and testing, rather than coding alone.\n\nJon Atack\u2019s experience highlights the evolving support system for Bitcoin Core contributors, emphasizing the necessity of humility and dedication. The conversation delves into the solitary yet impactful nature of this work, challenging common misconceptions about collaborative environments in software development. Atack also points out the various platforms where developers collaborate and discuss, further expanding on the roles beyond coding that contribute to the ecosystem, such as education and running review clubs.\n\nThe dialogue transitions into the broader implications of mentorship and educational initiatives within the cryptocurrency space, with Stephan Livera mentioning contributions from organizations like Vinteum and Library of Satoshi. Jon Atack reflects on the value of self-learning and mentorship programs, emphasizing the significance of showing \"proof of work\" in one's endeavors akin to Bitcoin's foundational principle. He also discusses the invaluable contribution of long-term engagement within the community, offering insights into maintaining historical context and knowledge that enriches collective understanding and decision-making processes.\n\nAddressing the technical and organizational aspects of Bitcoin Core development, the conversation sheds light on the Bitcoin Core PR Review Club, emphasizing its role in fostering understanding and engagement. Jon Atack advocates for a flexible approach to contributions, whether specializing or generalizing, highlighting the structured yet open pathway for submitting pull requests. Central to the discussion is the robustness and decentralization of Bitcoin Core, with Atack addressing community inquiries about alternative implementations and funding mechanisms, advocating for a collaborative approach to problem-solving.\n\nLastly, the personal toll on developers due to the demanding environment of core development is discussed. Jon Atack articulates the significance of constructive feedback and the emotional and intellectual demands placed on developers. He candidly shares the challenges of working under high stakes and external pressures, which can lead to burnout and deter talented individuals from contributing. This segment emphasizes the need for a supportive community that recognizes the human element behind technological advancements, ensuring the sustainability and growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nThrough their comprehensive conversation, Jon Atack and Stephan Livera offer valuable insights into the paths of contributing to Bitcoin Core, the importance of mentorship, and the challenges faced by developers. Their dialogue serves as an inspirational guide for aspiring contributors and emphasizes the collective effort required to foster a respectful and inclusive environment for the advancement of Bitcoin technology."
