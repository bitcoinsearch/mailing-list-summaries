    "body": "\n# Part 1\n\n## What makes bitcoin core fun\n\n- Intellectual challenge/problems\n- Interesting, diverse, open source project collaborators\n- Meaningful project goals\n- Culturally the project is a meritocracy\n- Scientific domain intersecting with real world problems\n- Real world usage\n\n## What makes bitcoin core not fun\n\n- Long delivery cycles -> lack of shippers high\n- Soft fork activation\n- Antagonism (internal and external)\n- Ambiguity of feature/code contribution usage\n- Relationships\n- Financial stability\n- Unclear goals\n\n# Part 2\n\n- Fitting rocks, pebbles, and sand in a jar analogy\n- Time based releases vs feature based releases?\n\nFeature based releases:\n\n- How to handle CVEs in feature based releases?\n- Partial features can be shipped (parts of BIP324 for example)\n- Scope of refactoring if they conflict with features\n- \"What is likely to make it in?\" mindset stops the bigger projects being shipped\n- \"High priority for review\" list is uncoordinated. Maybe we as a project should say that this feature should make it in\n- Be more vocal about what to get in and people need to be comfortable with that\n\n### IRC\n\n- Weekly meetings have been very quiet lately. Could use those meetings to coordinate\n- IRC channel in general is pretty quiet, it\u2019s a good venue to get one off opinions\n\nSetting priorities for 26.0?\n\n- Wlad had a say in previous releases, but with current group, we dont have as much of that direction\n- Excitement around coredev, but fizzles after without direction\n- Without goals, it's hard to get the big project (rocks) in\n- Self directed nature of the project in conflict with priorities. We would all have to actually commit to the priority projects\n- Having to sell oneself for purposes of getting grants can be in conflict with putting effort in toward long term projects\n- Suggestion of post-release meeting to discuss the next releases projects to include\n- Writing down the priorities makes it concrete, and is itself a projects \"concept ACK\"\n- And then using regular checkins on those projects through the release cycle\n- Inclusion of these projects in weekly IRC meetings, would solve empty meeting problem as well as keeping the project on everyones top of mind (own as well as potential reviewers)\n- Onus of project owner to attend meetings\n- Project Issue Trackers, consider pinning them as they are hard to find\n- Use GitHub Projects?\n- Feature prioritization is good, but one \"big rock\" is the project not falling over: Attestations, backport reviews, bitcoincore.org PRs, \"keep the lights on\" work, release process work, package management work. Shouldn't lose track of these pieces as well\n- Who does it? \"Release captain?\"\n- Group largely in agreement of priorities.\n\n# Part 3\n\n## Working in public vs progress via private collaboration\n\nRocks that succeed in getting into the project seem to have project working groups taken privately to coordinate\nNot just us (trolls, reporters) in the IRC channel anymore. Seems like important conversations have moved off of there (some think this is due to folks not wanting to spam the IRC channel), but where is it next? (not bitcointalk, not IRC, maybe not mailing list).\n\n- IRC subchannels\n- Signal groups\n- People like working in private without disruptions/distractions. More direct communication is more efficient\n- Risk of missing out on valuable contributions/contributors when project is less public\n- Technical design decisions via starting small group and growing slowly\n- Recent \"Mempool clustering\" as an example\n- Stop energy risk and impedance to progress with broader audience being involved\n- Consideration of putting a lot of energy into a project privately and then being resistant/attached when pushing it publicly\n- Tension of moving quickly vs. getting public attention\n- Consensus, policy, p2p as more valuable (for internal and external parties) public feedback, vs. internal arguments about the internals of guix for example\n\n## Stop energy vs. forward motion\n\n- Counterpoint of wanting to \"NACK\" something to give honest feedback\n- Stop energy spilling out of the project contributors into social media and snowballing is dangerous as well\n- Distinction between stop energy with no constructive criticism vs technically well founded nack\n- And reacting to each of these differently\n- Stop energy vs being afraid of stop energy\n- For example a PR with no formal ACK, but a lot of nits\n- Pushing for more concept acks earlier, assumeutxo example\n- Private conversations about objections to early technical approaches that were merged, but the objections weren't given early and now objectors distanced themselves from the effort instead of correcting\n\n## Trolls\n\n- Find controversy and amplify it\n- Non-technical abuse\n- Making the project contributors experience unpleasant\n- Repeated assertions of bad faith behavior?\n\n## Is this a project with intention?\n\n- Goals of discussion is to help make this a project you all want to work on\n- Retention of contributors is achieved by helping contributors achieve their goals\n- If you want something different, we need to do things differently\n\n",

    "summary": "In a recent exploration of the dynamics within the Bitcoin Core development community, several key themes emerged, offering a glimpse into the intellectual rigor, collaboration challenges, and the evolving nature of open-source projects in the cryptocurrency realm. A structured examination reveals both the rewarding and challenging aspects that developers encounter, alongside strategic discussions aimed at refining the project's trajectory.\n\nAt the heart of Bitcoin Core's appeal is the intellectual challenge it presents to its contributors. The project is celebrated for attracting a diverse group of collaborators united by meaningful goals and a meritocratic culture, where scientific inquiry meets tangible, real-world applications. This blend of theoretical problem-solving with practical impact underscores the project's allure. However, the path is not without its hurdles. Contributors face long delivery cycles, complex soft fork activation processes, internal and external antagonism, and ambiguity regarding the utilization of contributions. These challenges, coupled with personal relationship dynamics, financial stability concerns, and unclear objectives, illustrate the multifaceted nature of contributing to such a significant open-source initiative.\n\nThe discussion then pivots to the operational mechanics of the project, particularly the debate between time-based versus feature-based releases. Feature-based releases, while flexible, introduce complexities in handling critical vulnerabilities and integrating partial features. The discourse highlighted the need for better coordination and prioritization within the project to ensure significant advancements are not sidelined by smaller, albeit important, tasks. Suggestions include more vocal advocacy for certain features, utilizing weekly IRC meetings for better coordination, and establishing clear priorities for upcoming releases.\n\nFurthermore, the transition towards working in private groups as opposed to public forums was scrutinized. This shift, driven by the desire for efficient communication and minimal disruptions, raises concerns about potentially overlooking valuable contributions and contributors. While private collaboration might accelerate progress on certain fronts, it risks creating echo chambers resistant to external feedback. The balance between moving swiftly and inclusively engaging the broader community remains a delicate one, necessitating thoughtful consideration of when and how to broaden discussions.\n\nThe conversation also touched upon the phenomena of \"stop energy\" and the impact of trolls on the project's morale and progress. Distinguishing between constructive criticism and unproductive negativity is crucial for maintaining forward momentum. The community's approach to managing dissent and external disruptions reflects on its ability to foster a healthy, productive environment for innovation.\n\nIn conclusion, the dialogue surrounding Bitcoin Core development encapsulates the complexities of advancing a pioneering open-source project. It underscores the necessity of clear goal setting, effective prioritization, and inclusive communication strategies to harness the collective expertise and enthusiasm of its contributors. As the project evolves, so too must the methodologies and practices that guide its development, ensuring that Bitcoin Core remains at the forefront of technological advancement and community engagement."
