    "body_formatted": "{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"We are going to be taking a 15 minute coffee break after our next two speakers. I want to introduce you to James Gatto and Marco Santori with Pilsbury. They will be spending some time talking about Bitcoin law. They have a room this afternoon and they are offering to talk with you one on one. So Marco and James.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"You missed the introduction. Was it any good? (laughter)\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"We are here to talk about legal issues. We are going to try to keep it light and interesting. I am going to talk about patents. And Marc is going to talk about the regulatory issues.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Most people when I talk about patents kind of zone out because lots of people have preconceptions that patents are evil and bad. How many people think that patents are good? A few. How many think that patents are evil? So fair enough. I get that a lot as I travel around in the software and open source world.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I am going to talk not so much about law, but patents and guns. I am going to try to make it more interesting than most patent talks. The significance of this is that guns are not good nor evil, it depends on what someone does with them. I think that patents are the same way. There are good parts of the patent system and some people misuse it. How does that play out here?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"When you look at patents, there are different roles they can play. One of the most important, in particular with connection with Bitcoin, if someone gets a patent that covers fundamental aspects of where the development path is going, this can present a problem for everyone. So it's not the ability to get a patent to go sue people, it's the defensive part. Rather than shooting people, it's having a gun to defend yourself.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So the way that the patent system works, it used to be that if you were the first to invent somethin, even if someone filed after you, you could show that you were first to invent. The law was changed about 2 years ago so that it was first to file. So if someone files a patent before you, even if you have the idea before you, they can get a patent. So they can prevent you from doing what you have already done. And that's a bad thing for Bitcoin.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I've represented lots of open source ocmpanies like Novell who have done patent pledges, who claim they will only use the patents defensively. We're not going to go out and start patent wars. I think that in this community, it's similar concepts are relevant here. It's kind of like using a gun to defend yourself instead of shooting people. Patents have a defensive value as long as you can prevent the bad guys from blocking development.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I am not going to go into detail about patent law. I'll tell you this. If you want to think about patents, there's two simple things you should keep in mind. You should talk with a patent attorney to see if what you have is patentable. One is that if you look around and you see what others are doing and you think you are doing something different, and you think it's new technology and new applications, if those two things are true, talk with a patent attorney. You might not file a patent. Just assess. Get proper advice and make an informed business decision. We have a room in the side, we have meetings setup, we're happy to talk during the day, we're happy to have a complementary conversation as a follow-up to this conference.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"My name is Marco Santori, I am an attorney. I work with Bitcoin Foundation. I chair the regulatory affairs committee.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"First, I want to talk about something you have seen a lot out there. And it's crowdsales and pre-sales. I think a lot of people are wondering how to fund their company. Do I have to go from VC to VC, the silicon valley death march? Give them a powerpoint presentation? Or can I put together a crowdsale or pre-sale? And the answer like a lot of things is it depends. There are ways to do it right, ways to do it wrong.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"If you are going to go a non-traditional route, and try to do a kickstarter-esque pre-sale of the product, it will be of great risk. As will anything that pushes the regulatory envelope. So how might we be able to do that?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Well, the sort of traditional method if you could call the last year or so tradition, is by minting a coin, pre-mine the coin and sell the coin. A lot of you have seen this happen. I try not to name names or particular coins if I don't have to. You probably know some of the people who have tried this. Sometimes the coin stands for a share in a company, a share of profits, a share of ownership, a share of decision making ability. Sometimes these coins are fuel for the product, to use the product in the future. Sometimes they are discount coupons. I can use these coupons to get a discount off of a product. Sometimes people just call it a currency and pre-sell. Each of these approaches will come with differnet risks. The trouble here, the key risk is that it could mean selling an unregistered security. This is one of the great bottlenecks in US innovation. US companies can't sell unregistered securities to unaccreddited or unsophisticated individuals. A company traded on NYSE or NASDAQ... they have filed a registration document, a form S1 with the SEC, it says this is my product, this is my company, this is my equity and what it entitles you to as a shareholder, and these are all the risks. One of the great reads in digital currency, the Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and then S1 registration papers, and they list lots of risks that go along with owning and using digital currencies. A great example is the S1 in the Winklevoss ETF registration documents.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"You can't sell securities in the US unless you sell them to accreddited and sophisticated investors. The people you are selling to have to be either rich or smart. This is one of the great tragedies of consumer protection is that people who are poor or uneducated can't buy unregistered securities. The upshot is that we have to figure out what is and is not a security. This is not easy to do. We can't even figure out what is and isn't money. There's a test.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"It says, look, there are all these factors for figuring out whether this thing I am selling is a security. Someone owned an orange grove, he was going to sell plots out, based on how many oranges they produce I'll pay them back and I'll keep a cut, and the SEC saw this and said it's a security. You can't sell this to unaccreddited investors. The supreme court articulated this test. One thing to remember is that the use, purpose and timing of what you're selling.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"What is the first use? What are we using this stuff for? We have to have a non-speculative use. This is the first touchstone question. This thing that we're selling, currency tokens or whatever. If there's some use besides speculation, like buying for $1 in the hopes of selling for $2 one day, then you are working in the right direction. Also the purpose, what is the purpose of this token? This pre-sold item? It should be something beyond investment. So if I own a co-op in New York, it's where I live. I bought a share technically. It wasn't an investment, it's because what comes along with those shares is a home for me and my family. Timing. When do these other benefits other effects of this token kick in? If it's right away, it's better. Farther off, it's worse. SEC is going to want to see immediate non-speculative non-investment uses for whatever you're selling. That's something that separates the pre-sale of a product and a pre-sale of an investment. Has the SEC shown any interest in this? Yes.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"There was the Shavers case yesterday. The Bitcoin S&T and this guy was running a ponzi scheme. He found himself on the receiving end of the SEC down in Texas. And his very first argument was that Bitcoin isn't a security, and that it isn't money. So whatever it was doing, even if it was a ponzi scheme, the SEC who usually has jurisdiction over investments.. Judge found against him, he doesn't care what the investment is denominated in, if it's an investment then the SEC has oversight over.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"The SEC has a 50 man task force to look into digital currencies and securities and how they might exercise control over this space. This is real. Just a couple of weeks ago we spent 2 hours talking about what their priorities are in this space. I can go in depth into what they are looking for. I don't want to see another Bitcoin S&T thing happen again. I don't want anyone to be on the receiving end of the SEC nastygrams. So that's one thing that is front and center in the digital currency space in terms of regulation.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Another thing that I tlak about a lot is bank secrecy. How many people are fmailiar with how bitcoin is treated with KYC, Bank Secrecy Act, etc.? Okay, so I'll start from the top.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"In 2013, FinCEN released guidance and published guidance that called Bitcoin a convertible virtual currency. So they said if you are receiving and transmitting Bitcoin, then you are a money transmitter under the Bank Secrecy Act. So the entire industry said this was crazy, and Patrick Murck said, \\\"this is an overreach\\\". This was very big news. You are going to be regulated just like Moneygram and Western Union and banks. So people developing software turned into financial services company. It's crazy. There's some lessons to tae home from this. Any time you are acting as an intermediary, you are receiving coins and sending coins, there is a good chance that you will face some form of regulation under the Bank Secrecy Act. It may be expensive, but at least you know what to do about it. As the march of progress moves on, it becomes more complex. What does it mean to hold Bitcoin? If there's a single signature on a single .. if you know the private key, you are probably an intermediary. If I have two out of three keys, but you need all three to sign the transaction, is that enough control to make me an intermediary? Well it depends. It depends on the aspects of the business. I wish it was more clear. There would be less time spent paying attorneys.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"States are concerned more with consumer protection.

But you guys suck compared to Wall Street. They have been thinking since the 1930s of weird tweaks to different products to try to bring them outside of consumer protection laws.

So if you are selling a coin that is really the purpose is that you want to fund your company, and you want that money to come from someone who has nothing to do with your company, and if the purpose is to sell it later for more, but also you get a subscription to Popular Mechanics, come on that approach wont work.

So in the blockchain maybe that's not true, maybe the developers will be called into it? We don't know. That's part of the uncertainty that we face in this industry. We need short and straightforward conversations. The law always lags behind business models and innovation. For many of the creative things that will be built, there is no clear law for whether you can do it. You need to sit down with attorneys and go through all the facts. Is there something that makes it clearly illegal? Generally there's a risk profile. What are the factors that agencies will consider? Are you in the light, or dar grey, or dark dark? Also understand how, and this is what we often do, you are proposing you want to do this, if you make some light changes you might be in a much safer legal position. So that's part of the process of figuring out what to launch to minimize the chance of getting shut down by one of the agencies before you get far enough out of the blocks.\"}",

    "summary": "In a compelling session on Bitcoin law, James Gatto and Marco Santori from Pilsbury offered insights into the often misunderstood realms of patents and regulatory issues surrounding digital currencies. James Gatto initiated the discussion by demystifying patents, drawing an intriguing parallel between patents and firearms to argue that the intrinsic value of patents, much like guns, is determined by their application. He elucidated the defensive role of patents within the Bitcoin ecosystem, especially highlighting the shift from a 'first to invent' to a 'first to file' system in patent law. This change, according to Gatto, poses significant challenges for Bitcoin developers, as it prioritizes filing dates over the original invention date, potentially stifling innovation. To counteract these challenges, Gatto advocated for the strategic use of patents as a defensive measure rather than a tool for litigation, suggesting that companies pledge to use patents solely for protective purposes.\n\nFurthering the conversation, Marco Santori addressed the financial regulations impacting Bitcoin and other digital currencies, specifically focusing on the contentious issue of crowdsales and pre-sales. Santori provided a nuanced view of the opportunities and pitfalls associated with funding startups through digital currency, underlining the importance of navigating the regulatory landscape carefully to avoid legal repercussions. He explained the criteria used to determine whether a token sale constitutes an unregistered security offering, emphasizing the need for a token's first use to be non-speculative and its purpose to extend beyond mere investment. Santori also highlighted recent regulatory scrutiny, including the Shavers case, which underscored the SEC's jurisdiction over investments denominated in Bitcoin.\n\nSantori continued to shed light on the implications of the Bank Secrecy Act for Bitcoin transactions, explaining how FinCEN's classification of Bitcoin as a convertible virtual currency subjects certain activities to regulations applicable to money transmitters. This designation has profound implications for developers and businesses within the Bitcoin space, necessitating a careful assessment of whether their services render them intermediaries under the law. Santori stressed the importance of understanding one's regulatory obligations to mitigate the risk of costly compliance issues.\n\nThe dialogue transitioned to a broader discussion on the regulatory environment for digital currencies, with both speakers indicating a willingness to engage with attendees for further clarification and advice. They emphasized the complexity of navigating legal considerations in the rapidly evolving digital currency landscape, advocating for informed decision-making and proactive legal consultation.\n\nIn conclusion, Gatto and Santori\u2019s presentation illuminated the intricate interplay between legal frameworks and digital currency innovation. By dissecting the nuances of patents and regulatory compliance, they provided valuable perspectives for entrepreneurs and developers navigating the legal intricacies of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Their discussion underscored the imperative of understanding and engaging with legal principles to foster sustainable development and innovation within the digital currency space."
