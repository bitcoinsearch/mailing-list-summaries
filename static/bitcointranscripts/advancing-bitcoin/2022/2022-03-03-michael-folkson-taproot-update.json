I wanted to highlight a few points just so that we think about some of these things when we make future soft fork proposals. A couple of points from this timeline, one it took a very long time. If you go back to 2008 when the Schnorr signature patent expired, people were talking about Schnorr post 2008. The idea for spending from a Merkle tree of scripts dates back to 2012. There were various proposals from that point onwards. There was [BIP114](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0114.mediawiki), there was [BIP116](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0116.mediawiki), and these all moved the conversation forward and it was really valuable work. I think it is important that we remember that we do need to get the best proposals into Bitcoin and we need to be confident and clear as a community that when we embark on a soft fork activation process that we are as confident as possible that this is the best proposal to enable the functionality that we want and that it is not going to be replaced by something better in the short to medium term. Obviously the idea of using Schnorr and Taproot, the Taproot proposal was early 2018, I certainly think and presumably we all think because we activated this soft fork that the proposal that we activated was the best proposal. If we\u2019d activated some of these earlier proposals perhaps they wouldn\u2019t be used and we\u2019d have to continue to support them in full node implementations like Bitcoin Core. That is not the best way to go, certainly in my opinion. We need the best proposals into Bitcoin, we need overwhelming community support that whatever we\u2019re activating is the best possible proposal for Bitcoin. I suppose the last point I\u2019d like to make, in a decentralized community it is just impossible to have an authority figure that says \u201cYes we are going to do this soft fork. This soft fork is going ahead.\u201d In a decentralized community it is really hard. Anyone can stand up, I could stand up today and say \u201cWe are going to do a soft fork tomorrow for whatever, a new opcode in 6 months\u201d. Hopefully you would all say \u201cMichael you can\u2019t speak for the community, no one person can say this soft fork is going to happen\u201d which does it make tricky. I think the only solution to this problem is that things go really, really slow. Whenever an activation process starts for a soft fork everyone knows about it. If you\u2019ve paid any attention to Bitcoin technology whatsoever you know about it. The only way you get to do that is community engagement, there were various things, Bitcoin Optech, Taproot workshops, structured review, IRC meetings, tonnes of stuff. This was all really valuable work to get the community to a point where they\u2019d heard about Taproot, they knew the benefits and we were all confident that it was the best proposal to get into Bitcoin. I could talk a bit about activation but I\u2019ll leave activation. That\u2019s probably another talk in itself.\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"More Drake gifs\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I did promise the only bad jokes would be Drake gifs.

Who knows what is going to be in the next soft fork and when it will be? Personally I think it will be a bundle of opcodes, sighash flags or Simplicity. Or perhaps both. That would be my prediction but I could be totally wrong and I have no idea how the community will converge on whatever the next soft fork is.

The \u201creal work\u201d hasn\u2019t started. He is being self deprecating, there were 5 to 10 years of hard work from Pieter and others but there is still so much work to do for various projects.

Obviously before Taproot, a script is saying how certain Bitcoin in a UTXO can be spent. Before Taproot you would have a very long script such as the one below and it would be behind a hash. Whenever you spent from that script you\u2019d have to satisfy the conditions from that very long script. The key point was that it was a very long script and whenever you spend from that script it goes onchain.\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"What is Taproot?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"With Taproot as Jimmy was saying we can now split this script up into various parts. There is the key path and there is the script path. You would expect to use the key path most of the time, it is a single key spend every time you use the key path in Taproot, only a single key and a single signature are going onchain. Interestingly you can do some multisig schemes, you can use MuSig, perhaps FROST, where it is a multisig protocol but only a single key and a single signature are going onchain. As far as the blockchain knows, whenever you spend from a key path only a single key and a single signature are going onchain. Even if there is some fancy protocol behind how you construct that single key and single signature. The script path would generally be considered the exit scenario when something goes wrong with that key path. I\u2019ve said \u201cTap me if you need me\u201d. Generally you\u2019d expect to use the key path but you can encode various different spending conditions within this Merkle tree. If you do need them you tap that Merkle root, you prove that the leaf script that you are spending from is in the Taproot tree. Then you satisfy the conditions of that leaf script to be able to spend from that pay-to-taproot (P2TR) address. This really should be imprinted on your minds. Certainly if you are thinking of doing anything with Taproot or leveraging Taproot.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"`Q = P + H(P | c)G`\"}, {\"type\":\"list\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"<https://github.com/bitcoinops/taproot-workshop/blob/master/2.2-taptweak.ipynb>\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Alternatively if you prefer a math formula, that\u2019s the math formula for Taproot.

The really important thing is that if a project looks around and is going \u201cNo one else supports sending to a P2TR address\u201d they are not going to support receiving to a P2TR address.\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"What is a P2TR address?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"What Bitcoin Core and Lightning implementations have done is enable sending to any future SegWit version. There is an example of a P2TR address, the `p` represents `1` so this is SegWit version 1. Whenever you see a `bc1p` that is a mainnet Taproot address. It is really important that all businesses, projects support sending to this because if they don\u2019t support this you can\u2019t give out a Taproot address. If there is a wallet that can\u2019t send money to a Taproot address then you can\u2019t give them a Taproot address to send to. As Murch said you can even support sending to future versions because it is the responsibility of the person giving out the Taproot address that they don\u2019t give out Taproot addresses they can\u2019t spend from or that anyone can spend from. Ideally the approach everyone would take is to support sending to any future SegWit version even at this point, whether it is SegWit version 2, 3, 4 and who knows whether we\u2019ll have any of them. We are back into the world of speculating future soft forks.\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"Taproot\u2019d wallets (including Bitcoin Core)\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So I talked about sending to Taproot addresses, obviously generating Taproot addresses and receiving to those addresses is a bit more complicated. You need to know how to spend from that Taproot address and that is a lot more complicated than just being able to send to a Taproot address. There are various levels of support. Hopefully people will support spending from key paths, script paths and eventually supporting constructions of complex Taproot trees of scripts.\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"The Taproot descriptor tr()\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"`tr(pk_1,{pk_2,pk_3})`\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"<https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/115227/how-to-represent-a-taproot-output-with-more-than-2-scriptleaves-as-a-descriptor>\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Support for the `tr()` descriptor was included in Bitcoin Core 22.0.

Andrew Chow has introduced a new Taproot descriptor `tr()`. In Core it only supports spending from pubkeys on both the key path and the script path. If you go back to that Taproot tree diagram even if you are spending from the Taproot tree currently the Bitcoin Core wallet will only let you spend from a single pubkey even if you are using a script path, a leaf script. You are only spending from a single pubkey currently. Obviously there is work being done such that that restriction will be lifted. The Core wallet and other wallets, they\u2019ll support from sending from complex scripts within the Tapleaf of a Taproot tree.\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"multi_a() and sortedmulti_a()\"}, {\"type\":\"list\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Interestingly Script didn\u2019t change much. \u201cTapscript\u201d is the terminology we are using, this upgrade to Script. Script hasn\u2019t actually changed much, it was just that Taproot tree structure that we introduced. One of the few changes to Script as part of the Taproot soft fork was the replacement for CHECKMULTISIG, CHECKSIGADD is not yet supported in the Bitcoin Core wallet but that are descriptors that map to the use of this new multisig opcode. And presumably other projects will also use these updated multisig descriptors that support CHECKSIGADD in the future. Obviously totally different to MuSig and FROST which are doing a multisig protocol but only a single key and single signature going onchain. With CHECKMULTISIG and with these multisig descriptors multiple signatures and multiple keys are still going onchain. There are lots of different areas to multisig and Jimmy did a great job of going through some of those.\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"Taproot\u2019d Miniscript\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Once we get onto enabling complex scripts, I totally agree with previous speakers, I think Policy and Miniscript is going to be the way to go.

If you compare the complexity of the script to the policy the policy seems a lot easier to construct. The Miniscript compiler will generate that Miniscript for you and that Miniscript is just an encoding of Script. The problems with trying to construct one of those scripts for yourself without using something like Policy and Miniscript, it is very easy to get things wrong. You can very easily lock up funds accidentally, you can have hidden spending paths that you didn\u2019t realize you had that could allow parties in your multiparty protocol to steal your funds or a hacker to steal your funds. There is just so much that can go wrong when you try to start constructing your own script. There is work to do to finalize the first version of Miniscript. But I certainly think that\u2019s going to be the way to go if we are going to be writing complex scripts ourselves and perhaps tweaking them depending on the demands or interests of particular projects because they will all want different scripts presumably. Lots of different combinations and multisigs, timelocks, hashlocks whatever.\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"Taproot\u2019d Miniscript\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Miniscript is not yet finalized or in Core. darosior is doing work to get that into Core, that\u2019s been a long term project, this is the Core wallet obviously. There are a few open questions. Does Policy and Miniscript ignore these multisignature protocols where only one single key and one single signature go onchain? Do you just effectively put a pubkey into your Policy and then Policy and Miniscript doesn\u2019t know anything about these complex multisignature protocols? Or does Miniscript tell you to use MuSig and FROST because it is more efficient and less data is going onchain? They are kind of open questions. Updating the Policy to Miniscript compiler is going to be a big project potentially. This would be the Miniscript compiler constructing that Taproot tree for you. You effectively say \u201cThese are all the conditions I want. I am likely to spend from this one but I might not spend from these others.\u201d Then the Miniscript compiler would construct that Taproot tree for you, very ambitious, Sanket will tell you more on whether we\u2019ll be able to get there. The running theme is there is still so much work to do now that we have Taproot and on various projects we are kind of just scratching the surface. We are certainly nowhere near the end destination for enabling a lot of this Taproot functionality.\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"Taproot\u2019d Lightning\"}, {\"type\":\"list\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Oliver (Gugger) will be talking about Taproot\u2019d Lightning later. I chatted to him a couple of days ago, just to check I wasn\u2019t going to repeat what he was going to say later. I\u2019ll say a couple of things on Lightning. There are some people who are very enthusiastic about upgrading Lightning for Taproot. t-bast has a great [doc](https://github.com/t-bast/lightning-docs/blob/master/taproot-updates.md). I did say all my gifs would be Drake ones but I lied. Anyway that\u2019s t-bast\u2019s. There is a lot of enthusiasm but it is a big project in itself. The Lightning implementations, as far as I know, all support closing a channel to a P2TR address. Again everyone should, Lightning wallets etc. Opening a channel from a P2TR address is a work in progress. Then there are various questions. Are we going to use this new Taproot multisig opcode (CHECKSIGADD) or are we going to wait for MuSig? Are the Lightning template scripts going to use the Taproot tree? PTLCs is a whole other problem. With HTLCs you have a hash and a preimage, the preimage goes from the destination back to the source. If we are going to have PTLCs you are going to have the equivalent of a private key to a public key getting exchanged back from the destination to the source. And so it is not just a question of upgrading a channel between peers, it is can we use PTLCs from source A to destination B. That\u2019s going to be a real problem because it is not just upgrading a channel, it is looking at the whole route and checking that PTLCs are enabled from the source to the destination. Long term project, lots to discuss, barely scratching the surface.\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"Taproot\u2019d Lightning - upgrading Lightning gossip\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"<https://btctranscripts.com/c-lightning/2021-11-01-developer-call/#future-possible-changes-to-lightning-gossip>\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"One thing there has been quite a lot of work so far on Lightning that I don\u2019t think Oliver is going to cover later, upgrading Lightning gossip. If Lightning was to upgrade to using MuSig, rather than the 2-of-2 with 2 signatures and 2 pubkeys going onchain it would only be one pubkey and one signature going onchain. It would be very difficult to identify onchain what the channel opens and channel closes are. But currently Lightning gossip still gossips which UTXO you are committing to when you are opening a channel. You are getting the privacy benefit on the blockchain but if anybody, Chainalysis or any of these bad guys, is monitoring gossip they still can currently determine which UTXO you\u2019ve committed to. Ideally we would sever that link entirely and we\u2019d have a gossip protocol on the Lightning Network where you are able to prove that you had those funds to open a channel and not actually say which UTXO it is. There have been various discussions on how to do that. So far the conclusion sadly has been that a lot of the cryptographic magic like ring sigs, ZK proofs aren\u2019t mature, have very large proofs which makes it problematic to use new cryptographic magic to achieve that severing of gossip ties. Possibly you could just commit to a small UTXO and then make lots of large channels because you\u2019ve committed to a single small UTXO. But obviously that is opening up a partial DoS vector because you could prove that you own 0.1 Bitcoin and then open channels with 10 Bitcoin and you don\u2019t actually own 10 Bitcoin. Still in discussion but there has been movement in terms of upgrading Lightning gossip. There are other questions like do you use stuff like [Minisketch](https://btctranscripts.com/c-lightning/2022-03-07-developer-call/#minisketch-and-gossip-spam) and do a big gossip update or do we just stick to Taproot stuff?

I wanted to highlight a few points just so that we think about some of these things when we make future soft fork proposals. A couple of points from this timeline, one it took a very long time. If you go back to 2008 when the Schnorr signature patent expired, people were talking about Schnorr post 2008. The idea for spending from a Merkle tree of scripts dates back to 2012. There were various proposals from that point onwards. There was [BIP114](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0114.mediawiki), there was [BIP116](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0116.mediawiki), and these all moved the conversation forward and it was really valuable work. I think it is important that we remember that we do need to get the best proposals into Bitcoin and we need to be confident and clear as a community that when we embark on a soft fork activation process that we are as confident as possible that this is the best proposal to enable the functionality that we want and that it is not going to be replaced by something better in the short to medium term. Obviously the idea of using Schnorr and Taproot, the Taproot proposal was early 2018, I certainly think and presumably we all think because we activated this soft fork that the proposal that we activated was the best proposal. If we\u2019d activated some of these earlier proposals perhaps they wouldn\u2019t be used and we\u2019d have to continue to support them in full node implementations like Bitcoin Core. That is not the best way to go, certainly in my opinion. We need the best proposals into Bitcoin, we need overwhelming community support that whatever we\u2019re activating is the best possible proposal for Bitcoin. I suppose the last point I\u2019d like to make, in a decentralized community it is just impossible to have an authority figure that says \u201cYes we are going to do this soft fork. This soft fork is going ahead.\u201d In a decentralized community it is really hard. Anyone can stand up, I could stand up today and say \u201cWe are going to do a soft fork tomorrow for whatever, a new opcode in 6 months\u201d. Hopefully you would all say \u201cMichael you can\u2019t speak for the community, no one person can say this soft fork is going to happen\u201d which does it make tricky. I think the only solution to this problem is that things go really, really slow. Whenever an activation process starts for a soft fork everyone knows about it. If you\u2019ve paid any attention to Bitcoin technology whatsoever you know about it. The only way you get to do that is community engagement, there were various things, Bitcoin Optech, Taproot workshops, structured review, IRC meetings, tonnes of stuff. This was all really valuable work to get the community to a point where they\u2019d heard about Taproot, they knew the benefits and we were all confident that it was the best proposal to get into Bitcoin. I could talk a bit about activation but I\u2019ll leave activation. That\u2019s probably another talk in itself.\n\n# More Drake gifs\n\nI did promise the only bad jokes would be Drake gifs. We\u2019ve got another Drake gif, [this](https://twitter.com/fiatjaf/status/1499043339487821825?s=20&t=oi1OY4gJMxy7IuH50ZRK_Q) was fiatjaf on Twitter. Who knows what is going to be in the next soft fork and when it will be? Personally I think it will be a bundle of opcodes, sighash flags or Simplicity. Or perhaps both. That would be my prediction but I could be totally wrong and I have no idea how the community will converge on whatever the next soft fork is. But this is a Taproot presentation and there is still tonnes of Taproot work to be done.\n\n# The \u201creal work\u201d begins\n\nAnother [tweet](https://twitter.com/pwuille/status/1459778730369368067?s=20&t=2cAoMRNx50daYabUT7Z-Pw) from Pieter (Wuille). This is back when Taproot activated. He said \u201cthe real work will be in building wallets/protocols that build on top of it to make use of its advantages\u201d. The \u201creal work\u201d hasn\u2019t started. He is being self deprecating, there were 5 to 10 years of hard work from Pieter and others but there is still so much work to do for various projects. I\u2019ll do a high level overview of the various projects and how they can leverage Taproot, or are in the process of leveraging Taproot. There is still so much work to do to take advantage of the benefits.\n\n# What do/did we have pre-Taproot?\n\nP2SH, P2WSH address that reveals the entire script when spent from\n\ne.g.\n```\n<key_1> OP_CHECKSIG OP_SWAP <key_2> OP_CHECKSIG OP_ADD OP_SWAP\n <key_3> OP_CHECKSIG OP_ADD OP_SWAP OP_DUP OP_IF <a032>\n OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_VERIFY OP_ENDIF OP_ADD 3 OP_EQUAL\n```\n\nJimmy gave a great intro to Taproot itself. Obviously before Taproot, a script is saying how certain Bitcoin in a UTXO can be spent. Before Taproot you would have a very long script such as the one below and it would be behind a hash. Whenever you spent from that script you\u2019d have to satisfy the conditions from that very long script. The key point was that it was a very long script and whenever you spend from that script it goes onchain.\n\n# What is Taproot?\n\nWith Taproot as Jimmy was saying we can now split this script up into various parts. There is the key path and there is the script path. You would expect to use the key path most of the time, it is a single key spend every time you use the key path in Taproot, only a single key and a single signature are going onchain. Interestingly you can do some multisig schemes, you can use MuSig, perhaps FROST, where it is a multisig protocol but only a single key and a single signature are going onchain. As far as the blockchain knows, whenever you spend from a key path only a single key and a single signature are going onchain. Even if there is some fancy protocol behind how you construct that single key and single signature. The script path would generally be considered the exit scenario when something goes wrong with that key path. I\u2019ve said \u201cTap me if you need me\u201d. Generally you\u2019d expect to use the key path but you can encode various different spending conditions within this Merkle tree. If you do need them you tap that Merkle root, you prove that the leaf script that you are spending from is in the Taproot tree. Then you satisfy the conditions of that leaf script to be able to spend from that pay-to-taproot (P2TR) address. This really should be imprinted on your minds. Certainly if you are thinking of doing anything with Taproot or leveraging Taproot.\n\n`Q = P + H(P | c)G`\n\n* Q is the tweaked public key\n* P is the internal public key (P = xG where x is the private key)\n* H is the hash function\n* | is concatenation\n* c is the commitment to the Taproot tree\n* G is the generator point\n\n<https://github.com/bitcoinops/taproot-workshop/blob/master/2.2-taptweak.ipynb>\n\nAlternatively if you prefer a math formula, that\u2019s the math formula for Taproot. You are committing to the internal pubkey, the Taproot tree and that\u2019s all combined into the Taproot pubkey which is encoded into the Taproot address.\n\n# Sending and receiving to P2TR addresses\n\nSo the first step, any project, any business in the space should be thinking about is supporting sending to P2TR addresses and also ideally receiving to P2TR addresses. Murch has this [wiki page](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32_adoption) where he is monitoring community adoption for the various projects, wallets, protocols etc that are supporting sending to P2TR.\n\n# Working towards a circular P2TR address economy\n\nMurch had an interesting point on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/murchandamus/status/1493234619021504512?s=20&t=2cAoMRNx50daYabUT7Z-Pw) where he said it is really important that projects don\u2019t wait for other projects to start adopting Taproot. The really important thing is that if a project looks around and is going \u201cNo one else supports sending to a P2TR address\u201d they are not going to support receiving to a P2TR address.\n\n# What is a P2TR address?\n\nWhat Bitcoin Core and Lightning implementations have done is enable sending to any future SegWit version. There is an example of a P2TR address, the `p` represents `1` so this is SegWit version 1. Whenever you see a `bc1p` that is a mainnet Taproot address. It is really important that all businesses, projects support sending to this because if they don\u2019t support this you can\u2019t give out a Taproot address. If there is a wallet that can\u2019t send money to a Taproot address then you can\u2019t give them a Taproot address to send to. As Murch said you can even support sending to future versions because it is the responsibility of the person giving out the Taproot address that they don\u2019t give out Taproot addresses they can\u2019t spend from or that anyone can spend from. Ideally the approach everyone would take is to support sending to any future SegWit version even at this point, whether it is SegWit version 2, 3, 4 and who knows whether we\u2019ll have any of them. We are back into the world of speculating future soft forks.\n\n# Taproot\u2019d wallets (including Bitcoin Core)\n\nSo I talked about sending to Taproot addresses, obviously generating Taproot addresses and receiving to those addresses is a bit more complicated. You need to know how to spend from that Taproot address and that is a lot more complicated than just being able to send to a Taproot address. There are various levels of support. Hopefully people will support spending from key paths, script paths and eventually supporting constructions of complex Taproot trees of scripts.\n\n# The Taproot descriptor tr()\n\n`tr(pk_1,{pk_2,pk_3})`\n\n<https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/115227/how-to-represent-a-taproot-output-with-more-than-2-scriptleaves-as-a-descriptor>\n\nSupport for the `tr()` descriptor was included in Bitcoin Core 22.0. Only creates `tr()` descriptor in fresh wallets.\n\nPR 22051 (Basic Taproot derivation support for descriptors): <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22051>\n\nAn open PR 23417 to allow old wallets to generate Taproot descriptors: <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23417>\n\nI think the best practice now, especially for a new wallet, is to use descriptors. Andrew Chow has introduced a new Taproot descriptor `tr()`. In Core it only supports spending from pubkeys on both the key path and the script path. If you go back to that Taproot tree diagram even if you are spending from the Taproot tree currently the Bitcoin Core wallet will only let you spend from a single pubkey even if you are using a script path, a leaf script. You are only spending from a single pubkey currently. Obviously there is work being done such that that restriction will be lifted. The Core wallet and other wallets, they\u2019ll support from sending from complex scripts within the Tapleaf of a Taproot tree.\n\n# multi_a() and sortedmulti_a()\n\n* PR 24043 (Add multi_a descriptor for k-of-n multisig inside tr): <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24043>\n* Added to milestone for Bitcoin Core 24.0\n\nInterestingly Script didn\u2019t change much. \u201cTapscript\u201d is the terminology we are using, this upgrade to Script. Script hasn\u2019t actually changed much, it was just that Taproot tree structure that we introduced. One of the few changes to Script as part of the Taproot soft fork was the replacement for CHECKMULTISIG, CHECKSIGADD is not yet supported in the Bitcoin Core wallet but that are descriptors that map to the use of this new multisig opcode. And presumably other projects will also use these updated multisig descriptors that support CHECKSIGADD in the future. Obviously totally different to MuSig and FROST which are doing a multisig protocol but only a single key and single signature going onchain. With CHECKMULTISIG and with these multisig descriptors multiple signatures and multiple keys are still going onchain. There are lots of different areas to multisig and Jimmy did a great job of going through some of those.\n\n# Taproot\u2019d Miniscript\n\nOnce we get onto enabling complex scripts, I totally agree with previous speakers, I think Policy and Miniscript is going to be the way to go. Sanket is talking on Miniscript later and doing a workshop tomorrow. I certainly recommend attending those.\n\n# Miniscript (recap)\n\n<https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/>\n\nPolicy: `thresh(3,pk(key_1),pk(key_2),pk(key_3),older(12960))`\n\nMiniscript: `thresh(3,pk(key_1),s:pk(key_2),s:pk(key_3),sdv:older(12960))`\n\nMiniscript from C++ compiler has since changed: <https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/115288/why-has-the-miniscript-for-this-particular-policy-changed-over-the-past-few-mont/>\n\nWhen you are constructing a script or tweaking a script I think the future will be interacting at the Policy level. If you compare the complexity of the script to the policy the policy seems a lot easier to construct. The Miniscript compiler will generate that Miniscript for you and that Miniscript is just an encoding of Script. The problems with trying to construct one of those scripts for yourself without using something like Policy and Miniscript, it is very easy to get things wrong. You can very easily lock up funds accidentally, you can have hidden spending paths that you didn\u2019t realize you had that could allow parties in your multiparty protocol to steal your funds or a hacker to steal your funds. There is just so much that can go wrong when you try to start constructing your own script. There is work to do to finalize the first version of Miniscript. But I certainly think that\u2019s going to be the way to go if we are going to be writing complex scripts ourselves and perhaps tweaking them depending on the demands or interests of particular projects because they will all want different scripts presumably. Lots of different combinations and multisigs, timelocks, hashlocks whatever.\n\n# Taproot\u2019d Miniscript\n\nMiniscript is not yet finalized or in Core. darosior is doing work to get that into Core, that\u2019s been a long term project, this is the Core wallet obviously. There are a few open questions. Does Policy and Miniscript ignore these multisignature protocols where only one single key and one single signature go onchain? Do you just effectively put a pubkey into your Policy and then Policy and Miniscript doesn\u2019t know anything about these complex multisignature protocols? Or does Miniscript tell you to use MuSig and FROST because it is more efficient and less data is going onchain? They are kind of open questions. Updating the Policy to Miniscript compiler is going to be a big project potentially. This would be the Miniscript compiler constructing that Taproot tree for you. You effectively say \u201cThese are all the conditions I want. I am likely to spend from this one but I might not spend from these others.\u201d Then the Miniscript compiler would construct that Taproot tree for you, very ambitious, Sanket will tell you more on whether we\u2019ll be able to get there. The running theme is there is still so much work to do now that we have Taproot and on various projects we are kind of just scratching the surface. We are certainly nowhere near the end destination for enabling a lot of this Taproot functionality.\n\n# Taproot\u2019d Lightning\n\n* Closing a channel to a P2TR address\n* Opening a channel from a P2TR address\n* Taproot multisig for 2-of-2 (OP_CHECKSIGADD)\n* MuSig(2) for cooperative closes (space savings, privacy)\n* Using the Taproot tree for alternative script paths\n* PTLCs\n* Other Taproot ideas (additional spending path if peer comes back online)\n\nOliver (Gugger) will be talking about Taproot\u2019d Lightning later. I chatted to him a couple of days ago, just to check I wasn\u2019t going to repeat what he was going to say later. I\u2019ll say a couple of things on Lightning. There are some people who are very enthusiastic about upgrading Lightning for Taproot. t-bast has a great [doc](https://github.com/t-bast/lightning-docs/blob/master/taproot-updates.md). I did say all my gifs would be Drake ones but I lied. Anyway that\u2019s t-bast\u2019s. There is a lot of enthusiasm but it is a big project in itself. The Lightning implementations, as far as I know, all support closing a channel to a P2TR address. Again everyone should, Lightning wallets etc. Opening a channel from a P2TR address is a work in progress. Then there are various questions. Are we going to use this new Taproot multisig opcode (CHECKSIGADD) or are we going to wait for MuSig? Are the Lightning template scripts going to use the Taproot tree? PTLCs is a whole other problem. With HTLCs you have a hash and a preimage, the preimage goes from the destination back to the source. If we are going to have PTLCs you are going to have the equivalent of a private key to a public key getting exchanged back from the destination to the source. And so it is not just a question of upgrading a channel between peers, it is can we use PTLCs from source A to destination B. That\u2019s going to be a real problem because it is not just upgrading a channel, it is looking at the whole route and checking that PTLCs are enabled from the source to the destination. Long term project, lots to discuss, barely scratching the surface.\n\n# Taproot\u2019d Lightning - upgrading Lightning gossip\n\n<https://btctranscripts.com/c-lightning/2021-11-01-developer-call/#future-possible-changes-to-lightning-gossip>\n\nOne thing there has been quite a lot of work so far on Lightning that I don\u2019t think Oliver is going to cover later, upgrading Lightning gossip. If Lightning was to upgrade to using MuSig, rather than the 2-of-2 with 2 signatures and 2 pubkeys going onchain it would only be one pubkey and one signature going onchain. It would be very difficult to identify onchain what the channel opens and channel closes are. But currently Lightning gossip still gossips which UTXO you are committing to when you are opening a channel. You are getting the privacy benefit on the blockchain but if anybody, Chainalysis or any of these bad guys, is monitoring gossip they still can currently determine which UTXO you\u2019ve committed to. Ideally we would sever that link entirely and we\u2019d have a gossip protocol on the Lightning Network where you are able to prove that you had those funds to open a channel and not actually say which UTXO it is. There have been various discussions on how to do that. So far the conclusion sadly has been that a lot of the cryptographic magic like ring sigs, ZK proofs aren\u2019t mature, have very large proofs which makes it problematic to use new cryptographic magic to achieve that severing of gossip ties. Possibly you could just commit to a small UTXO and then make lots of large channels because you\u2019ve committed to a single small UTXO. But obviously that is opening up a partial DoS vector because you could prove that you own 0.1 Bitcoin and then open channels with 10 Bitcoin and you don\u2019t actually own 10 Bitcoin. Still in discussion but there has been movement in terms of upgrading Lightning gossip. There are other questions like do you use stuff like [Minisketch](https://btctranscripts.com/c-lightning/2022-03-07-developer-call/#minisketch-and-gossip-spam) and do a big gossip update or do we just stick to Taproot stuff? Still lots and lots to discuss, still scratching the surface.\n\n# Taproot\u2019d Lightning - Views on the way forward\n\nZmnSCPxj <https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2021/09/01/#preparing-for-taproot-11-ln-with-taproot>\n\nAJ Towns <https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2021-October/003278.html>\n\nThere are differing views on what should be prioritized. I just have two people, Z-man and AJ, but various people have different levels of enthusiasm/time to prioritize this. It is going to take a lot of work, if you went to the Lightning event a couple of days ago, the spec process is 2 implementations implementing a new feature and formalizing a particular spec or BOLT. It is not just the case of an individual implementation implementing it and running with it, we want compatibility across implementations on the Lightning Network ideally.\n\n# Taproot\u2019d Lightning - Channel upgrades\n\nBOLT 2 (upgrade protocol on reestablish): <https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/868>\n\nI\u2019lll skip that because I think I\u2019m coming up on time.\n\n# Taproot\u2019d Liquid\n\n* New opcodes enabled through OP_SUCCESS mechanism\n* PSBT v2 for confidential transactions (PSET)\n* The 11-of-15 threshold sig peg in/out using  FROST or a similar threshold scheme\n* Simplicity\n\nThere is some interesting stuff on Liquid. Taproot is activated on Liquid but there are some new opcodes on Liquid. It would be really cool if we get Simplicity on Liquid. That certainly seems a strong candidate for a future soft fork. Simplicity is a complete replacement of Script itself, a lot of the problems with Script that Miniscript tries to resolve. Simplicity would be a complete replacement of Script, at least for that Tapleaf version taking Script out completely.\n\n# Other protocols\n\n* Coinswap/Teleport (currently using ECDSA 2-of-2, could use MuSig2 in future)\n* Atomic swaps\n* Scriptless scripts/adaptor signatures\n* DLCs\n\nThere are other protocols. Before Taproot was activated there was lots of enthusiasm for all these off-chain protocols using Schnorr and Taproot. Hopefully that enthusiasm will come back. Now we\u2019ve got Schnorr I don\u2019t know why people aren\u2019t revisiting all the ideas they had for building off-chain protocols with Schnorr. Hopefully people will digest that we actually have Schnorr signatures onchain now and the cool ideas they had for using Schnorr are now possible.\n\n# Future possible soft fork(s) built on Taproot\n\n* New sighash flags (e.g. SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT)\n* New opcode(s) e.g. OP_CTV, OP_TLUV, OP_CAT, OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK etc\n* Simplicity enabled on a new Tapleaf version\n* Graftroot, G\u2019root etc\n* Cross input signature aggregation (needs Taproot successor)\n\nLots of ideas for future possible soft forks. We will hear about some of them at the conference. But as I said let\u2019s, as a community, be very slow and cautious and ensure that whatever is in the next soft fork, whenever that is, is the best possible proposal for Bitcoin and won\u2019t be replaced something superior a year or two afterwards.\n\n# Q&A\n\nQ - How often do you look at other wallet implementations and other node implementations?\n\nA - I try to follow Bitcoin Core and Lightning spec. I feel as if I\u2019m stretched way too thin doing that. I do follow Murch\u2019s wiki site to see what the community adoption of Taproot is. I am aware that Laolu and Oliver have got a bunch of Taproot stuff into btcd, the Go alternative full node implementation to Core. I try to monitor it at a high level but I feel as if I\u2019m stretched way too thin just trying to follow Core and Lightning but doing my best.\n\n\n",

    "summary": "In his \"State of the Taproot Address 2022,\" Michael Folkson offered an enlightening overview on the evolution and significance of Taproot within Bitcoin's ecosystem, blending technical insights with community spirit. Starting on a lighter note, he acknowledged the challenges faced by the Bitcoin community, particularly emphasizing the unity and resilience within the development ecosystem amidst global uncertainties like those in Ukraine. This introduction set the stage for a deep dive into the history, development, and future potential of Taproot, highlighting its foundational role in enhancing Bitcoin's privacy, efficiency, and overall capability.\n\nThe journey through Taproot's inception began with the expiration of the Schnorr signatures patent in 2008, igniting discussions on its application in Bitcoin. These conversations laid the groundwork for various proposals that eventually led to Taproot's development. Folkson stressed the importance of community consensus in the adoption of new technologies within Bitcoin, underscoring the decentralized nature of the community as both a strength and a challenge. This decentralized approach necessitates slow, deliberate progress and widespread engagement for successful soft fork activations, he noted.\n\nFolkson humorously promised that the only jokes in his presentation would be through Drake gifs, maintaining a balance between technical discourse and engaging content. He ventured into speculations about the future of Bitcoin soft forks, considering bundles of opcodes, sighash flags, or the introduction of Simplicity, while acknowledging the uncertainty surrounding these possibilities. The real work, as highlighted by a tweet from Pieter Wuille, begins post-activation, focusing on developing wallets and protocols that leverage Taproot's advantages. Folkson provided insights into ongoing projects aiming to utilize Taproot, indicating a significant amount of work still required to fully harness its benefits.\n\nBefore Taproot, transactions using scripts like Pay to Script Hash (P2SH) or Pay to Witness Script Hash (P2WSH) were inefficient and lacked privacy, revealing the entire script upon spending. Taproot introduces a more elegant solution by allowing transactions to default to a single-key spend while encoding multiple spending conditions discreetly within a Merkle tree, significantly enhancing privacy and efficiency. Folkson urged businesses and projects within the Bitcoin ecosystem to adopt Taproot, facilitating a smoother transaction process and promoting a circular P2TR economy.\n\nExploring further, Folkson delved into the `tr()` descriptor introduced by Andrew Chow in Bitcoin Core 22.0, marking a significant step towards embracing Taproot functionalities, albeit with current limitations in spending capabilities. He discussed the integration of multisignature mechanisms within the Taproot framework, highlighting the proposed `multi_a` descriptor and differentiating between on-chain multisig descriptors and off-chain multisig protocols like MuSig and FROST. Miniscript, as a tool for constructing Bitcoin scripts, was presented as a promising avenue for reducing risks associated with manual script construction, despite incomplete integration into Bitcoin Core.\n\nFolkson outlined the potential benefits of Taproot for the Lightning Network, including channel management improvements and innovative features like Point Time-Locked Contracts (PTLCs), while acknowledging the considerable work and consensus required for their implementation. The refinement of the gossip protocol within the Lightning Network emerged as a critical aspect, balancing privacy enhancements with network integrity.\n\nThe discussion extended beyond Bitcoin and Lightning to Liquid, a sidechain benefiting from Taproot's activation. Folkson touched on the broader implications of Taproot for various protocols, including Coinswap, atomic swaps, and Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs), signaling a renewed interest in off-chain solutions leveraging Schnorr signatures.\n\nFinally, Folkson shared his personal engagement with the Bitcoin development ecosystem during a Q&A session, illustrating the complexity and dedication involved in contributing to Bitcoin's technical progress. His candid reflection on the challenges of keeping up with developments resonated with the broader developer community's experience in navigating the rich landscape of Bitcoin innovation.\n\nMichael Folkson's address not only charted the technical journey and collaborative effort behind Taproot's development but also underscored the ongoing work required to maximize its potential, presenting a comprehensive overview of Taproot's impact across Bitcoin's core functionality, the Lightning Network, and extended protocols."
