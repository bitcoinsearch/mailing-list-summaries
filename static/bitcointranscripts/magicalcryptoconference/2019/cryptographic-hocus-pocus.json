This is an email from 2014. Someone was working on zerocoin, which is a similar concept to zcash, but using different cryptography. Long-story short, he wanted to make this happen.

If you're going to use an airgapped machine, you don't want the adversary to know what the machine is or to even be able to guess it. Zooko and I talked about this. I decided to not tell him what I was doing for the trusted setup. I just asked him for his budget and then did this. Of the six people participating in this, nobody but zooko knew that I was involved.

Hopefully you guys are all awake ish or something. I am going to give a talk about the zcash trusted setup. As many of you know, I was involved in it. The way to start is to answer, what is it?\n\n## What is the zcash trusted setup?\n\nIt's a bunch of toxic waste, basically. Zcash has some advanced privacy technology called zkSNARKs.

The idea is that multiple people come together to collaboratively create this toxic waste in such a way that at least in theory, you need all of the in our case 6 people to collude to actually generate that waste for real in one place. You could imagine a nuclear reactor where the waste is dematerialized into six other dimensions.\n\nThis sounds good in theory.

    "summary": "In a recent podcast, Peter Todd delves into the intricate world of Zcash's trusted setup, shedding light on both its innovative approach to privacy and the inherent challenges that accompany it. The discussion begins with an explanation of Zcash's utilization of zkSNARKs technology, which stands at the core of its privacy features. By allowing transactions to remain confidential, zkSNARKs require a foundational process known as the trusted setup. This setup generates what Todd refers to as \"toxic waste\" - critical information that, if accessed by malicious entities, could be exploited to counterfeit Zcash currency.\n\nThe conversation transitions into an overview of the multi-party computation (MPC) process designed to mitigate the risks associated with the trusted setup. Theoretically, this process requires collaboration among multiple parties to generate the toxic waste, aiming to ensure that no single party can compromise the system's integrity. Todd describes this concept through the analogy of dematerializing nuclear waste into separate dimensions, highlighting the complexity and theoretical security benefits of such an approach.\n\nPeter Todd recounts his personal journey into the realm of cryptocurrency privacy, tracing back to his initial involvement with Zerocoin and eventually Zcash. Despite early hesitations and potential conflicts of interest within the community, Todd's expertise in cryptography led him to commend Zcash for its bold implementation of zkSNARKs despite the risks of critical bugs that could undermine the entire system.\n\nAs the narrative progresses, Todd shares his experiences participating in the Zcash trusted setup ceremony. He emphasizes the extreme measures taken to safeguard the process, including the use of air-gapped machines and conducting operations while mobile to reduce vulnerability to attacks. Yet, despite these precautions, Todd reveals his venture into what he terms the \"Cypherpunk desert bus,\" an endeavor characterized by long, solitary drives through areas with minimal cellular service to further obscure the ceremony's activities from potential adversaries.\n\nTodd's recounting takes a critical turn as he addresses the broader implications and potential shortcomings of the trusted setup ceremony. Through a detailed examination of the ceremony's reliance on specific software and hardware, he highlights the difficulty in fully auditing these components, pointing to a fundamental trust issue. The critique extends to the security practices surrounding the ceremony, including the use of newly released compilers that could introduce unanticipated vulnerabilities.\n\nA particularly telling anecdote involves journalist Morgan Peck, whose phone exhibited unusual behavior during the ceremony, underscoring the challenge of verifying the integrity of all involved hardware. This incident serves as a springboard for Todd to discuss the overarching theme of risk denial within the community. He argues that the ceremony's perceived security was compromised by reliance on non-independent sources and a lack of transparency about the process's actual mechanics.\n\nIn his concluding remarks, Todd reflects on the notion of security theater within the cryptocurrency space. He criticizes the practice of overstating security measures without adequately addressing underlying vulnerabilities. Instead of promoting unquestioned trust in complex setups, Todd advocates for a more straightforward approach that acknowledges current technological limitations and communicates potential risks transparently to the public. This candid perspective encourages a reevaluation of how privacy and security are implemented and perceived in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency."
