Alright, alright.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"WO: It's getting some good usage. A lot of those are businesses. Definitely it's in the early stage. Elizabeth talked about this. There's a lot of things that are mostly for fun, it's not really at ecommerce yet.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"LC: That's for lnd?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"WO: Sure, and I think Lisa can talk about c-lightning.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"LC: I like these different implementations for LN. Lisa, what about c-lightning development right now?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"LN: I think a lot more stuff has been built for lnd for liquidity projects. We're trying to make more accessible for people to build their tools for c-lightning. One of the ways we've been doing that is the c-lightning 0.6 release in Apirl or MArch with the new plugin system which allows third-party developers to build kind of in-process applications as plugins. It gives you more access to customizing the node.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"LC: What about dual-channel funding?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"LN: That's spec work, yeah. The dual funding proposal came up in back in November. We had a meeting in Australia and we had a few things we wanted to see in the spec in the future. Right now, dual funding would be you open a channel and both sides would have the opportunity to contribute funds if they would like to. This would hopefully lead to a more balanced network topology.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"LC: And also close in channels as well?

Someone might say you have 1 BTC of inbound liquidity, but if that liquidity is only in your corner of the network.... and if you're a routing node, if everyone shares similar common inbound liquidity, then you're really not bridging anybody, and the way you add value to the network is bridging people together as a router.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"LC: What lightning usage do you expect will increase?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"LN: I think more vendors will come online.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"LC: What kind of vendors?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"LN: The examples I find most interesting is..... basically he opened a node to sell t-shirts and swag online.

I think we're going to be strictly in the toy phase right now. A lot of you want to hold bitcoin since the market price is going up. I love the vendor use case, and I think lightning is in an interesting position where technology gets interest before the tech is there. People don't really want to spend bitcoin right now. Once it gets stable and people can think about it.... I think in the next year, we're going to be seeing more use cases.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"LC: Lisa, how do you think the lightning network is going to impact the cypherpunk movement and culture more broadly?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"LN: I'm hesitant to answer for the cypherpunk community because I am not sure I am in touch with that community. But I understand some of the ethos, like giving power to people so that they can transact peer-to-peer instead of only authorized vendors. I think lightning has new potential to enable people to transact globally. It's super easy to just send a payment directly and you don't have to involve middlemen. One thing that Ireally like about lightning is like keeping in the forefront of their minds and they are adding payments to the system is the ability to ..... and that's like, there's definitely this ability for you to go out and buy something and not have that show up anywhere on any report. I heard from a friend that payment systems traditionally, like credit cards, they have an idea of where... so like anytime you use a credit card, it's attached to you, and they can see whether you wnat this or not, you can see where money is going. If you're a trader, I could see how you would want that information so that you can buy Macy's stock or something. But this is a development that will improve privacy.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"LC: What about user intentions? Alex, do you think the lightning network has a ethos? Is it being used in a way that is not designed to be used?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"AB: I think the ethos is driving development right now.

In c-lightning, we're adding the ability to hold on to a payment that you got from a vendor, so at some point in the future, you have a certain amount of time before that payment expires, and that payment... but when you send that payment, until it gets accepted at the vendor, all the money along the path to the vendor is locked up, it's kind of an escrow until that payment gets through. So this locks up the money along the route. As a network effect, if this occurs many times, then it makes the liquidity of the network harder to come by because it's all locked up. I think there's application developers and protocol developers need to keep this in mind and how it works.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"LC: I know you guys are working on tools and implementations. Is there anything in particular, Alex, that you admire about Lisa's work, or c-lightnign versus lnd?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"AB: I like the thinking about the spec.

It's not part of the lightning network baseline spec. It's not a BIP because I don't believe in standards processes. I think lightning is layer 2.

Some of you might have a gym membership and you have had trouble canceling the membership. But this shouldn't be possible in lightning.

    "summary": "In a recent panel discussion on the present and future of the Lightning Network (LN), experts including Will O'Beirne, Lisa Neigut, Alex Bosworth, and Leigh Cuen delved into the intricacies and potential of this transformative technology. The dialogue encapsulated a broad spectrum of topics from technical developments, use cases, to its impact on privacy and the cypherpunk movement.\n\nWill O'Beirne initiated the conversation by highlighting the early-stage adoption of the Lightning Network, primarily by businesses for experimental purposes rather than full-fledged e-commerce applications. This sentiment was echoed across the panel, indicating a consensus on the network's nascent but promising state.\n\nLisa Neigut discussed advancements in c-lightning, particularly emphasizing the introduction of the plugin system with the c-lightning 0.6 release. This development is pivotal as it enables third-party developers to create in-process applications, significantly enhancing the flexibility and utility of the LN by allowing for greater customization of nodes.\n\nThe topic of dual-channel funding was broached, revealing its potential to foster a more balanced network topology. This feature would allow both parties in a transaction to contribute funds to open a channel, thereby democratizing the funding process and possibly leading to a more equitable distribution of network capacity.\n\nAlex Bosworth shed light on the qualitative differences in inbound liquidity, noting that not all liquidity is created equal. The value added by routing nodes hinges on their ability to bridge disparate parts of the network, underlining the importance of strategic liquidity provision in enhancing the network's overall functionality.\n\nThe discussion then shifted towards potential use cases that could drive wider adoption of the Lightning Network. From vendors like those selling t-shirts and swag online to integrating exchange flows, the panelists envisioned a broad array of applications that could benefit from LN's capabilities. Bosworth specifically highlighted the significance of bringing exchange flows into the LN to capitalize on the billions of dollars flowing through exchanges that are currently not leveraging LN's efficiencies.\n\nLisa Neigut touched upon the Lightning Network's implications for the cypherpunk movement and broader cultural shifts. She underscored the network's potential to empower peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries, thereby enhancing privacy and reducing the visibility of transactions to unauthorized parties. This aspect of LN aligns closely with cypherpunk principles of disrupting traditional financial paradigms to favor more decentralized and private forms of commerce.\n\nThe conversation also explored the ethos driving LN development, with Bosworth pointing out the focus on making censorship impossible within the network. This is exemplified by technical features such as the ability to hold onto Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs), which could affect liquidity but also serve as a tool for ensuring transactional integrity and resistance against censorship.\n\nLooking ahead, the panelists shared projects and developments they are excited about. Innovations in plugin systems for c-lightning, improvements in payments routing, and new mechanisms for invoice payment were among the highlights. Additionally, the potential for users to have more control over their servers and the permissions granted to others was seen as a significant step toward decentralization and enhanced user autonomy.\n\nIn closing, the panelists reflected on the ultimate goal of enabling widespread Bitcoin spending through the Lightning Network. Despite current limitations and challenges, there is optimism about LN's ability to facilitate micropayments and empower small vendors, ultimately driving consumer adoption through superior transactional efficiency and lower costs compared to traditional payment processors. However, achieving this vision requires overcoming skepticism around merchant adoption and exploring new use cases that genuinely leverage LN's unique capabilities."
