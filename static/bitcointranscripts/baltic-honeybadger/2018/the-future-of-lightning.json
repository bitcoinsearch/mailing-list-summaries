Let's give a round of applause to the event organizers and everyone brought us back here. This is the warmest time I've ever been in Riga. It's been great. I want to come back in the summers.\n\n# Introduction\n\nI am here to talk about what has happened in the past year and the future of what we're going to see with lightning. One second while we get the clicker working. The tech never works at tech events. It's not the first time. Okay, awesome. Okay, it works sometimes.\n\nOne year ago, actually less, about 10 months ago, I was at Baltic Honeybadger. At the conclusion of my talk, I mentioned how excited I was for all the cool things coming in 2018. And now here we are. We need micropayments so I can use a micropayment to get my slides going here on lightning.\n\nI think we're okay with the clicker now. Fingers crossed.\n\n# History\n\nFor those who may not have been following the latest on lightning.... the year is 2008 and there's a pseudonymous person going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto and he releases a whitepaper to the world to little or no fanfare and basically nobody cared. The 10th anniversary of this paper is October 31st of this year. We're super excited about this. Yeah. I think we're going to have some great halloween parties.\n\nThe first response a few days later, was basically \"this system sounds great but I don't think it scales to the required size\" so basically \"cool story bro but does not scale\". This was recognized very early on. When you have a global decentralized consensus system, there are scalability issues.\n\nFast forward to 2015 there's a paper that I helped edit... called the Lightning Network. It's a series of smart contracts operating on top of bitcoin, a layer 2 protocol using local consensus.\n\n# Lightning network overview\n\nAlice and Bob enter into a 2-of-2 multisig contract to get into lightning. They both put in some money and then they update the state between them. These are real bitcoin transactions. By the way, there's no lightning ICO. I know. It uses real bitcoin transactions. Alice and Bob update their state when they send money between each other. Every time they update the state, they sign off on a new state and revoke the previous state so that they can't steal from each other by going back on their word. Cooperative close can be done in 10 minutes.\n\n# Payments as packets\n\nMaybe Alice and Bob only see each other once in a blue moon. You can have a network and payments can be routed through other nodes. This can use multi-hop and hash timelock contracts (HTLCs). The way that the forward in lightning works is that intermediate nodes can receive funds only if it atomically goes to sender. In the vast majority of cases, it instantly transacts and goes to the end of the route. We also have onion routing which is where the intermediate nodes only know the before/after nodes but not the entire path.\n\nWe're eliminating counterparty risk. You don't have to trust Alice or Bob or anyone else in the system.\n\n# If alice goes offline...\n\nMaybe Alice is sick of bitcoin twitter and she's going to go to a desert island... what happens to Bob? Bob can broadcast a transaction to the chain and he waits a given amount of time and then he gets his money back. Alice gets her money back when she comes online again and everyone is made whole.\n\n# If Bob tries to cheat...\n\nYou can't make up a state that doesn't exist, but you can broadcast a previous state. If Alice is offline, maybe a watchtower was monitoring and saw that Bob was trying to cheat. This can be enforced on the blockchain using pre-signed contracts. Bob shouldn't treat because if he tries, he's going to lose all of his money.\n\n# Removing the trusted financial intermediary\n\nYou don't have to trust Alice or Bob. The blockchain functions as a judge or dispute resolution mechanism. You can think of blockchain contracts as contracts. Not all contracts go to court. The vast majority of lightning transactions won't go to the blockchain. It can't be bribed. These transactions are pre-signed and we know exactly what will happen and how it will be enforced. This is of course based on the security of the blockchain, and bitcoin is the most secure blockchain with the most hashrate backing it up.\n\n# Lightning for many blockchains\n\nLightning also works on litecoin, which activated segwit. There's a concept of a lightning cross-chain atomic swap. Bob and Alice are on two different coins and they can be routed through an intermediary and to do an atomic swap between the two. November 2017 had the first lightning atomic cross-chain swap. This is exciting stuff in progress.\n\n# Launching lightning\n\nThat's the recap for the people who may have been under a rock for the past year.

This includes neutrino lite client improvements, better phone support, better privacy support, more tor support, reliability improvements, better pathfinding. For those of you running lnd, please upgrade if you haven't yet.\n\n# Interoperability\n\nThere's Blockstream c-lightning and ACINQ eclair client, and rust-lightning by BlueMatt, and a few implementations from someone in Japan. We've all been working from a common specification. There is only one lightning network, like the internet. We want everything to be interoperable. Here's the BOLTs specification repository. In December 2017, we announced interop tests between the 3 major implementations were complete. So we created an interoperable lightning network.

Neutrino is a lite client implementation that we use at Lightning Labs together with Jim Posen from Coinbase have designed that. BlueMatt had been involved in that. Includes bip157 and bip158. It's substantially more private and does not leak various user data and transaction information.

We couldn't believe this, it's 4000 merchants that are now accepting lightning. It's been incredible to see this evolve over the past year.\n\n# An application layer for bitcoin\n\nIs not only lightning a tech for high volume transactions on bitcoin, it's also an app development platform for bitcoin. We have yalls.org, my cofoundered laolu named this. A similar site with a similar name was not using lightning. So yalls is an article micropayment site where you can use lightning to pay for articles, or you can buy beers or a beer emoji.\n\nWe have zap which is an application and UI for bitcoin and litecoin. I am sure we have some folks in the room have used that. How many people in here have sent a lightning transaction in this room? Okay, great. How many plan to do a lightning transaction in the next year?\n\n# Satoshi's Place\n\nIn June 2018 there was a website that came online... I took a screenshot, I was thinking I need to show a screenshot of this for Baltic Honeybadger. There used to be million dollar homepage and you paid per pixel. In some versions, yo ucouldn't overwrite the pixels. This is mostly a safe-for-work version... I have some devil ears on, but it's not so bad.

The creator of this site makes $60-70 each time they do this. Luckily the community had saved the prior states and it got reverted. There are these pixel wars going on here. So why not make some pixel futures and have a marketplace for that?\n\n# Lightning tasks\n\nlnd.work is a mechanical turk site for lightning. You can pay small micropayments to do small amounts of work. Check it out, post some tasks as well.\n\n# First\n\nWe had a lot of firsts in the past year. For example, here was the first book purchased with lightning, the bitcoin standard. I know we're hearing about that here today. We can't keep up with everything going on, it's amazing and incredible. People can buy things with lightning here. Great work for those who put it up there. Someone purchased the first sandwich on lightning. There aren't many more firsts left, like the first champaign or the first shoe then you better do so soon because the firsts are running out.\n\n# Building the network\n\nWhen I was here in last November, we were on testnet but there was nothing on mainnet.

Don't put your life savings on lightning.\n\nHere's romport's map of the lightning network. I think there's about 107 BTC on the network. This is a lot. Don't put a lot of money into lightning. We'll see why in a second. It's been wild to see this evolve.\n\n# Craeful\n\nJohn Olivier did this amazing segment back in March where they told people instead of being in hodlgang, you should be craeful. Don't put more money into lightning network than you're willing to lose. I told people to put in $20 or something not huge.\n\n# shitcoin.com can't buy lightning nodes\n\nHe put out an article that he is going to buy all the nodes. But you can't even buy nodes.

Alex was manually opening channels to specific nodes that Alex liked. Andreas got all of his funds back in the event, hopefully he won't do that until LN gets farther along. It's about optimizing about where you connect in the network.\n\n# Casa\n\nThere's a Casa lightning node.\n\n# Community\n\nWe've been doing lightning hackdays in Berlin. Someone setup a lightning candy machine there too. Someone decided to take a photo of me while I was talking and then put it on twitter and satoshi's place while I was talking while I was at the Berlin lightning hackday. Amir Taaki tweeted about how engaged the community was. We had 150 people from all over Europe to come out and participate. We were blown away by the questions and how advanced everyone was and to see the community engagement. We're seeing these popping up elsewhere and that's incredible, one in NY and one in Madrid.\n\n# The year ahead\n\nWe're working on watchtowers. Neutrino will get more updates. lnd 0.5 had neutrino for testnet only. We want secure software. We believe we should have secure financial software. Neutrino mainnet will be coming soon, which will enable lnd mobile apps. And desktop apps won't have to sync the entire blockchain. Also we're interested in atomic multipath payments where you chop up your $10 payments into 5 $2 payments. They would go atomically on the network and arrive to the destination either fully complete or go back to the sender. This is important for liquidity and flowing through. Splicing is where you can add funds into a channel. You can also send a transaction out from a channel, called splice out.  Alex Bosworth was manually enabling channels. When we have things going, we want to route and find paths manually that Alex was doing manually.\n\nJameson reminded us and I want to relay this- we want this technology to be private, and there will be private channels. These channel explorer websites will start to become inaccurate because it wont be able to see most of the channels. Don't just look at the node count. The node counts will be growing but it will not be trackable.\n\n# Community\n\nA certain community online who will remain nameless and it has three letters... decided that I was the CEO of the lightning network. But no there are other implementations and we're an open-source community. We are all CEO of the lightning network, except for Craig Wright. Please check out CryptoGraffiti. He makes great swag.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIt's really been an incredible year so far. Someone tweeted this in January--- in December 1969, there were only a few nodes for the internet. Since then, so much has changed in the world. I think we're the same for bitcoin and lightning. This is the beginning and I can't wait to see what happens next. Thank you so much.\n\n",

    "summary": "In a compelling discussion, Elizabeth Stark delves into the groundbreaking evolution and promising future of the Lightning Network, shedding light on its inception, challenges, and significant advancements. The narrative begins with a reflection on Bitcoin's early days, as envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, where concerns about scalability were paramount. These concerns laid the groundwork for the development of the Lightning Network, introduced in a pioneering 2015 paper to which Stark contributed. This innovative layer 2 protocol, designed atop Bitcoin, aims to revolutionize transactions through smart contracts, enabling more efficient and cost-effective processes without the need for Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).\n\nStark meticulously explains how the Lightning Network enhances transactional efficiency by allowing participants to update their transaction states via multisig contracts without broadcasting each transaction to the blockchain. This method significantly increases speed and reduces costs while using real Bitcoin transactions. The network employs hash timelock contracts (HTLCs) to route transactions over multiple hops, ensuring security and eliminating counterparty risk by facilitating only atomically complete transactions.\n\nAddressing operational scenarios within the Lightning Network, Stark elucidates mechanisms in place to protect against offline participants or those attempting deceit. She highlights the blockchain's role as a trustless arbitrator, capable of resolving disputes through pre-signed contracts and enforcement actions, thus maintaining integrity and fairness among all parties involved.\n\nBeyond Bitcoin, Stark emphasizes the network's broader applicability, including its compatibility with Litecoin and its facilitation of the first lightning atomic cross-chain swap in November 2017. This achievement underscores the network's potential in fostering interoperability and flexibility across different cryptocurrencies, heralding new possibilities for digital asset trading.\n\nThe subsequent development of the Lightning Network is marked by a vibrant ecosystem, propelled by collaborative efforts among developers and users. Stark proudly acknowledges the community's role in achieving interoperable standards and continuous enhancements aimed at improving user experience, privacy, and reliability. The significant adoption by merchants and the emergence of platforms leveraging the Lightning Network for novel applications, including micropayments, illustrate its growing impact on payment processing and beyond.\n\nCreative utilization of the Lightning Network in initiatives like Zap, yalls.org, and Satoshi's Place further demonstrates its versatility and potential for innovation within the cryptocurrency space. These developments not only highlight technical progress but also emphasize the network's expanding role as a platform for experimentation and engagement.\n\nReflecting on the network's exponential growth, Stark draws attention to the surge in channels and participation, emphasizing the community's enthusiasm and commitment to building a more scalable, efficient, and inclusive financial system. Despite the rapid expansion, Stark advises a cautious approach to engagement, echoing John Olivier's counsel to invest wisely and within one's means. She humorously recounts anecdotes that underline the network's limitations and nuances, alongside stories of strategic success that illustrate the benefits of optimizing network connections.\n\nLooking forward, Stark outlines anticipated technical advancements aimed at enhancing the network's functionality and security, including the introduction of watchtowers, updates to Neutrino, and the development of features like atomic multipath payments and splicing. She underscores the importance of privacy and the evolving nature of network visibility, stressing the ongoing efforts to improve liquidity and transaction flexibility.\n\nIn her closing remarks, Stark draws an inspiring parallel between the early days of the internet and the current trajectory of the Bitcoin and Lightning Network, expressing optimism for their transformative potential. Her vision extends beyond technological innovation, aspiring for a collaborative and open-source community that rejects the notion of singular leadership.\n\nElizabeth Stark's insights into the Lightning Network not only provide a comprehensive overview of its current landscape but also offer a glimpse into its dynamic and promising future. With cautious engagement, enthusiastic community support, and forthcoming technological enhancements, the Lightning Network stands poised for further impact in the cryptocurrency world and beyond, embodying a testament to the power of collaborative innovation in redefining financial interactions."
