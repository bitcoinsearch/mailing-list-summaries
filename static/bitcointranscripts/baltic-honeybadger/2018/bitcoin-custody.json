Here is my PGP fingerprint, we should be doing that. So who am I, I have a software development background, I don\u2019t just type transcripts. I\u2019m actually no longer at LedgerX as of Friday (Sept 21 2018) when I came here.  That is the end of 4 years, so you are looking at a free man. [Applause] Thank you.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So what is custody? A few of these slides will be about regulations and custody. According to the SEC and the code of federal regulation 17 CFR Part 275. The custody rule is really misnamed. The custody rule is that it is forbidden for you to have custody of assets. So the custody rule is that that you can\u2019t have custody. Custody is defined as things like possession, access, authorization, and legal ownership, other things like that.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So all of these things have to be avoided in certain situations according to the securities regulator in the United States.  This is contrary to bitcoin though, because in bitcoin basically third parties are designed to be security holes and you shouldn\u2019t use them. Verses the intent of the custody rule or at least one of the intents is that it is about reporting and requirements around things like, you don\u2019t want the person managing your funds to steal all the money so you have to go with qualified custodian which are defined as banks, future commission merchants, broker dealers, or ambiguously foreign financial institutions. But with bitcoin you can say here is the public key and we are going to keep segregated accounts and maybe it is bip32 or something and this seems like a more secure way of doing custody and storage especially for buy and hold scenarios, which under the regulations if you go work with someone in a fund who is just doing buy and hold it has to be a qualified custodian but in my opinion it could be considered a third party security hole.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So for regulation in particular while it is a wonderful idea to say just work around the regulators and don\u2019t do any of that, it would also be good to give them realistic advice on how bitcoin works and make good proposals and good faith attempts to to tell them how bitcoin works and what they should be requiring. This often means you should give actual examples to regulators about how things work, don\u2019t just say use multisig.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I recently drafted with a few co-authors a letter to the sec about bitcoin etfs and things like\\nencouraging them to use public auditing with public keys or even things like secure ways of transferring bitcoin to the investors if they want to redeem their bitcoin holdings from the etf.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"At LedgerX I was a full stack developer and also their bitcoin expert. I helped them design their bitcoin custody solution and a number of other things.  They are regulated by the CFTC, they run a bitcoin clearinghouse and bitcoin options exchange, things like that.  Really quickly lessons learned from this is, automation is really good but sometimes it is not necessary. You can spend a lot of time and resources and costs developing software automation, but often it is better to manually do bitcoin transactions, especially in this case because their withdrawal process is very specific and it is not high volume in terms of the amount of data going through it.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Also there is no end to end off the shelf hardware security solution. I\u2019ll talk about that a bit more in a few minutes. We actually know a lot about this, this is just ways to store bitcoin.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So when you are designing a way to store bitcoin either for yourself or for a company you have to think about what is appropriate. This is based on what type of threats you have to protect against and you also have to be really be really clear on how it works. Probably no one in your family will know how to recover your bitcoin when you die.  So that is a really serious problem.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"The way to fix this and the way to do this in companies is just a lot of checklists and documentation. Can\u2019t have enough checklists. Maybe at the end when you have 20 pages of checklists, one of the checkboxes can be to remove some checkboxes, but not until then.\\nIn particularly for companies that are storing bitcoin I recommend a signing ritual or signing ceremony. Signing ritual is a defined process that is well documented with checklists, possibly with video surveillance and this is things like accessing the hardware security module or the hardware wallets or combining the hardware wallets or separately going to the hardware wallets in different venues and locations.  And having an actual process and training around this. And you will probably have to train the non technical members of either your company or family or whoever you are working with to actually be able to do this. One public example that is probably the most elaborate public example of a signing ceremony is a DNSSEC key signing ceremony.  Someone else also mentioned to me that Verisign had a really early key signing ceremony and they were even using vhs tape to record the whole thing back in the day. And they even had transfer procedures specifically for handling the tape. But that was not public. This is probably the most public one you will see. It\u2019s like 4 hours of ritual and you can watch it, the most exciting thing you will ever see on the internet.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"If you were to build out to store bitcoin there are three main topics to look at. One is risks, what happen to key material, what will happen in the world of bitcoin you should consider all of these and write them out. There is also a threat model- what are the adversaries trying to protect against. Some things you can\u2019t defend against, like nation state actors, but you can probably defend against lesser skilled adversaries and petty thieves.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"If you are choosing to use a third party for any reason related to bitcoin even it is an escrow agent, or someone on two or three multisig, or even if they are coinbase.com where they have entire control of your biticon, you need to ask who are they, who is working for them, what are their experiences, are they qualified. I\u2019ve often asked companies do you have an bitcoin developers at all and they often say no, but they claim to be a bitcoin company, so how do they know how the systems works if they don\u2019t actually have the talent inside the company.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Then want to put together custody into something you can use. We talked a lot about hardware wallets, not going to repeat this much, expect for screens.

That are  transactions you should usually be ok with it, It is useful for lightening, conjoin and other purposes. Another way to have hardware wallets is something I call a cryptographic multisig\\nlike non bitcoin multisig. Can have signing ritual process instead of logging into your hardware wallet perhaps you have other cryptographic hardware devices required to access that device and this is an additional layer of security on top of bitcoin multisig.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Now into some technical details, partially signed bitcoin transactions I talked about that earlier today on a panel, just a serialization format, but makes it easier to transfer data from bitcoin wallets to hardware devices.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"It is bip 174 I believe is already implemented and merged into bitcoin core.

You can encrypt those and store somewhere safe. In the event that you lose access to your hardware or the end of the world occurs, you can send the pre signed transactions for whatever purpose.  Another method similar to that is a way of enforcing a similar system to bitcoin vaults. And this an idea where you send bitcoin to an address and then with the private key for that address which you specially create for this purpose you sign a transaction that has a time lock sending it to another address, then you delete that private key so it only signs one bitcoin transaction in its entire lifetime.

    "summary": "In a recent discussion, Bryan Bishop delved into the intricacies of Bitcoin custody, sharing insights from his extensive experience in software development and his role at LedgerX. Bishop began by clarifying the often misunderstood concept of custody in the context of regulations set by the SEC, emphasizing how Bitcoin's design inherently contradicts traditional notions of third-party management due to its focus on eliminating security vulnerabilities associated with such intermediaries.\n\nBishop critically examined the regulatory landscape, advocating for a nuanced approach towards understanding Bitcoin\u2019s unique properties. He argued that instead of circumventing regulatory frameworks, stakeholders should engage with regulators to provide realistic, informed advice about how Bitcoin operates. This includes suggesting practices like public auditing and secure Bitcoin transfer mechanisms for ETF redemption processes, which could enhance transparency and security.\n\nDrawing from his tenure at LedgerX, Bishop shared practical lessons on Bitcoin custody solutions, highlighting the advantages of manual transaction processes over automation to mitigate risks and reduce unnecessary expenditure. He stressed the absence of a one-size-fits-all hardware security solution for Bitcoin storage, underscoring the need for tailored strategies based on specific threat models and risk assessments.\n\nThe importance of clear, accessible documentation and thorough training was another focal point of Bishop\u2019s talk. He recommended creating detailed checklists and conducting signing rituals to ensure secure handling of Bitcoin, even suggesting public ceremonies as an educational tool for understanding the complexities involved in cryptographic key management.\n\nExploring technological advancements, Bishop touched upon innovations in hardware wallets and the potential of cryptographic multisig setups to bolster security. He also introduced the concept of partially signed Bitcoin transactions (PSBT) and pre-signed transactions as methods for enhancing operational flexibility and security.\n\nIn concluding, Bishop underscored the critical role of hardware wallets in regulatory compliance and advocated for comprehensive custody solutions that include not just technological tools but also training and support services. His vision extends beyond current practices, proposing a decentralized model of asset management where instructions are sent directly to investors' devices for execution, thereby circumventing traditional custody challenges.\n\nBishop\u2019s insights offer a forward-looking perspective on Bitcoin custody, blending technical expertise with regulatory awareness to chart a path toward more secure, efficient, and compliant digital asset management practices."
