Think about the things that are banned, things that people like to do. Even gold for a long time was banned as a use of money. The state will do what it wants to. Failure of ban would result in a state-sponsored mining attack. They might make bitcoin a blackmarket money, if you accept it or use it then you are criminalized. It's not rational to assume that this wont happen if we're winning; it's the easiest tool that the state has. Once that doesn't work because people keep using blackmarket bitcoin because it's worth them to do... I say you should start mining, because you can do that centrally, because unlike other black markets, bitcoin can be attacked from one place, more optimally from one place by just mining. So you get 51% attacks. So how does bitcoin secure itself from this? Transactions might get censored, not mined, giant state-sponsored mining and people might try to get their transactions confirmed and it doesn't happen -what do you do when that happens? So you raise your fee, right? You're unauthorized transactions aren't getting confirmed and you don't know why, so you raise your fees, and the state miner is not going to mine these transactions. There's all this extra money and other premium to be made, by other miners. So more hashrate will come online to take that money, and suddenly the state doesn't have 51%. So what does the state do? Does it start taking the unauthorized transactions, does it give up because it's losing the 51% attack, or maybe it raises taxes to subsidize its mining operation.

    "summary": "In a compelling discussion led by Eric Voskuil, the intricacies of Bitcoin's scalability and its potential evolution into a reserve currency are thoroughly dissected. At the heart of this conversation lies the \"reserve currency fallacy,\" a misconception that has sparked debate within the cryptocurrency community. Voskuil delves into the history of Bitcoin, tracing back to its first public discussions in 2008, where scalability emerged as an immediate concern. Satoshi Nakamoto's initial response to these concerns proposed larger block sizes, a solution now seen as insufficient for addressing the complex demands of global financial transactions.\n\nHal Finney, an early contributor to Bitcoin's development, introduced a second scaling proposal envisioning a future where Bitcoin-backed banks issue digital cash. This model anticipated the need for a more efficient, secondary level of payment systems beyond the blockchain, foreseeing Bitcoin as a high-powered money serving as a reserve for these banks. Despite Finney's innovative foresight, modern scaling solutions like sidechains, drivechains, and the Lightning Network have shifted away from reliance on traditional banking models and authority-based systems, emphasizing decentralized approaches instead.\n\nThe discussion then transitions to Bitcoin's foundational principles and its vision to minimize state intervention in financial transactions. Voskuil emphasizes Bitcoin\u2019s role in reducing monetary inflation, surveillance, and censorship, positioning it as a tool for maintaining financial privacy and freedom. However, he also acknowledges the challenges Bitcoin faces from state actors who may seek to undermine its decentralized nature through regulatory measures or even direct attacks on the network.\n\nOne of the most critical parts of Voskuil's analysis addresses the potential for state-led interventions in Bitcoin, including the hypothetical creation of \"Fedcoin.\" Such interventions could aim to retain aspects of financial control lost with the adoption of cryptocurrencies, such as seigniorage and transaction transparency. The concept of Fedcoin highlights the tension between Bitcoin's decentralized ethos and the interests of state actors in maintaining control over financial systems.\n\nVoskuil's exploration of Bitcoin's security model reveals a strategic design intended to protect the network from state interference. He outlines how the network's inherent resistance to censorship and inflation serves as a bulwark against attempts to centralize control. Moreover, he elucidates the dynamic interplay between miners and merchants in sustaining Bitcoin's decentralized framework, emphasizing the importance of a collaborative defense against external threats.\n\nIn concluding his analysis, Voskuil reflects on the notion of reserves versus savings, critiquing the historical failures of gold standards and cautioning against similar outcomes with Bitcoin. He advocates for continued vigilance and innovation within the cryptocurrency community to ensure that Bitcoin remains true to its foundational principles of decentralization and resistance to state control.\n\nThrough his nuanced examination of Bitcoin's scalability challenges, potential future as a reserve currency, and the ongoing struggle against state intervention, Eric Voskuil offers a comprehensive overview of the complex dynamics shaping the world of cryptocurrencies. His insights not only illuminate the technical and philosophical underpinnings of Bitcoin but also underscore the critical importance of safeguarding the decentralized vision that defines it."
