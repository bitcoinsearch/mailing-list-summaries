SEC needs to come up with something to compete with GBTC so that there's a real reflection of bitcoin that someone with a retirement account can use.

It's a huge wild card; there's not much incentive for bitcoiners to have the SEC and explain why ethereum is centralized.

I don't understand the fascination with stablecoins at all. They are just centralized. They are just like a US dollar.... but now you're able to move this US dollar around on a very technologically unstable and potentially collapsable centralized database, whether ethereum or whether it's omni, whether it's the servers of Binance... I don't know how they are going to do it. You have a US dollar, you put it on top of a centralized platform just for the ease of use. In tether's specific cause, there was questions about whether it was 100% backed. This goes back to the SEC view- is a bitcoin-backed ETF good or bad for the crypto ecosystem? Is tether fractionally reserved or not? Is that good or bad for the ecosystem? I could make the case in either direction for both of these questions. If tether implodes, which I believe it will eventually-- is that good or bad for bitcoin? I happen to think tether imploding would be good for bitcoin, because there would be a rush to sell tether and turn it into bitcoin. They might get 20-30 cents on the dollar for it, and there will be a big entrance into bitcoin to get rid of your tether. But most of the exchanges, the exchanges are goin to take the hit. If tether goes down or other stablecoins go down, the exchange is going to get stuck with it, and they will pass on those losses to the consumer in the same way that Bitfinex passed on their losses even if you don't have bitcoin you took the penalty if you were on their exchange.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"BF: There's two kinds of stablecoins... there's several kinds. Some people call them stablecoins that aren't going to be stable because they don't have an understanding of how economics work and how to make something actually stable... but maybe it might be better to call it pegged coin. It's pegged to the dollar, which is easy if you're doing what Tether claims to do- which is backing it 1-to-1 with the dollar. That's useful in trading because in the investment world we have money market accounts which are a big facilitator that when trades come in from mutual funds or stocks or bonds... it's useful for firms to have their own system. The reason is that it comes down to the ledger which we all hopefully understand. How do you run a ledger? Who has the ledger of where all the dollars are? The US doesn't have a ledger like that. If you have a money market at Fidelity, how do you know you really have it? To facilitate trading and to facilitate the moving of bitcoin and ethereum and tokens and eventually security tokens, it's useful to have that kind of approach.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"BAG: Is that an alternative to the international wire transfer system?

I know that a lot of people get worried when Bitfinex prints another $500m of tether. That happens when Bitfinex creates the tether and whenever someone wants to move something out of Bitfinex- because of their wire transfer problems- you can either move the BTC out of Bitfinex or you move the tether. When bitfinex starts to run out of tether because their users are moving tether out, they need to create more, so that they have it so that users can move the US dollar out of tether instead of moving the bitcoin out of tether. It's a good option because many of these exchanges are having major banking problems and they are getting around this by using tether. It works until it doesn't, and the US government decides to confiscate the underlying dollars and I don't want to speculate whether tether is or is not fractionally reserved.

    "summary": "In a compelling exploration of the intersection between traditional financial systems and the emergent world of cryptocurrencies, Tone Vays and Bruce Fenton offer insightful perspectives on the dynamics at play within governmental monetary policies. Their discussion underscores a significant disconnection between the objectives pursued by policymakers and the transformative potential heralded by digital currencies such as Bitcoin. This divide, they argue, stems from a lack of practical engagement with the economic realities by those formulating monetary strategies, leading to misinformed or technically unsound policy approaches.\n\nBruce Fenton critically examines the contrast between the control-centric desires of policymakers and the decentralization ethos intrinsic to projects like Bitcoin. He characterizes attempts by governments to create digital currencies not as efforts to enhance monetary systems but as endeavors to retain power through centralization. Fenton posits that, were the aim genuinely to adopt the most effective form of money, Bitcoin's decentralized nature would make it an unequivocal choice. Instead, he suggests that the objective lies in maintaining control under the guise of innovation, a stance fundamentally misaligned with the principles of cryptocurrency.\n\nTone Vays expands on the discussion by addressing the global agenda to phase out physical cash, highlighting it as a strategy aimed at abolishing the anonymity and tangibility of cash transactions. This move, according to Vays, is motivated by governments' desire for increased oversight and control over financial transactions, allowing them to dictate monetary policy unimpeded by the constraints of physical currency. The adoption of digital currencies is thus framed not as an acknowledgment of blockchain's technological advancements but as a maneuver to consolidate governmental control over economic activities.\n\nThe conversation further delves into how governments might pursue the integration of digital currencies, with speculation around the utilization of platforms like Ripple. However, both speakers express skepticism regarding the ability of government-backed digital currencies to rival the innovative and emancipatory capabilities of Bitcoin. Unlike government initiatives, Bitcoin operates as an open-source project unfettered by the traditional financial ecosystem, epitomizing resistance to the control and manipulation governments seek.\n\nIn conclusion, the dialogue between Tone Vays and Bruce Fenton illuminates the stark differences in motivation behind governmental moves towards digital currencies and the revolutionary ethos of decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Through their analysis, Vays and Fenton articulate a vision of the future where financial sovereignty and innovation challenge the prevailing norms of centralization and control, suggesting a paradigm shift towards greater autonomy in the financial domain."
