I am a long-term bitcoiner. I've been in bitcoin since 2010. I love bitcoin. I am passionate about it. I want to see it grow and prosper.

After the segwit deployment, I feel like development has skyrocketed and it's really moving forward although there's still a lot of things to do. Bitcoin development I feel is not so sexy as for other blockchains because they do ICOs and there's just more money.  Bitcoin is much more complex and it's not so easy. Can we make it more attractive?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Investors... they want their 50x returns. You have crypto investors going for fast returns. They focus on tokens.

They believe bitcoin is internet money for criminals and crazy people, it's not backed by anything and doesn't have intrinsic value, it consumes too much energy, it's too volatile to serve as money, it's too nerdy and unusable, it's too complex to buy and use and store it. It's several years of media brainwashing.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I was upset about this. I want to see bitcoin succeed. What can we do about this? What can I do about that? I love decentralization but maybe if we sit down together and a few smart people can pool some money together and direct some efforts towards that. I believe I understand the needs but please if I have misunderstood then please feel free to speak up. For developers, if we get more developers then that would be nice. There is a need not just for Core developers but basically application developers and middleware developers. Investors and corporations just need to understand the capacities of bitcoin. The next year I go to blockchain events, I want these people to say ah we've been considering bitcoin because we only need a token or that's what we need or we only need to do some timestamping. They should use bitcoin because it's there, maintained, stable and secure. This is sometihng I want to shift the perception to. The hodlers need good security, usable multisig, self-custody and better privacy especially if one day they decide not to hold but to spend. For merchants, I feel like merchants should only have to click one button and have everything done and not have to study anything online or ask people for help. For influencers, they need better reasons to show bitcoin. I don't know how to go about it, but I hope we will find out. I wish that policymakers would finally understand that bitcoin is not theirs to take. It's not something that fits into their brackets. We're so early in this space that we're still defining bitcoin. They are still trying to put their labels on this and put it into some legal framework. I think that's a mistake and we should communicate that.

You know him, please give him applause. First of all, don't worry. I will be super fast. Since 2013, in the last 5 years, I wanted to find a way to help bitcoin development. Any kind of business I created, was an excuse to allow me to take part in this revolution. It has to be sustainable. But I really wanted to help bitcoin somehow. A big part of this is personal selfish reasons. Maybe in my presentation you see the BHB Network is the same logo as honeybadger. It doesn't really mean anything. What is BHB? I will tell you about my experiences in one miunte while exploring different models for bitcoin development.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Does bitcoin need any kind of help? Does bitcoin need us to push something, fund something or whatever? In the long run, bitcoin does not need any specific coordinated central effort in order to succeed. You could say, better safe than sorry, so let's do it anyway. But I put a question mark here because I think bitcoin in the long run could succeed without any kind of concentrated or coordinated effort. But in the short run, we're witnessing that in the absence of coordination there's a lot of waste of resources, time, money, brainpower, there's developers wasting their productive life into ethereum or other projects. There's a lot of misallocation of resources and this is slowing down bitcoin development and adoption and it's destroying value in the mean time. Maybe bitcoin doesn't need us to step in for the long run, but I do think it requires us to take action to prevent misallocation.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"The current models for bitcoin are these three-- the first is hold and build. You buy bitcoin, and you develop applications or other value-added service. Step 3, profit because the price of bitcoin goes up. You don't need an organization to do that. This is what I started with in 2013. I quit my job, I started to help meetups with my money hoping that my little bitcoin stash was going to grow into more valuable. It didn't work out very well, because I spent more bitcoin than the increase in value, but it was an experiment. It's good for alignment of incentives because you really want bitcoin to succeed if you are holding. But there's also free riding, like you can just sit and do nothing and get rich with bitcoin. In the long run, it's not sustainable. If bitcoin reaches a plateau or something, like with hyperbitcoinization, then we're in trouble with this model.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"In 2015, I was trying the Redhat model. This is something that many people in the space are experimenting with. We work on open-source development for free, but since we work on it, we're the experts, and we can sell consulting or customization and education and support and other value-added services. So this is what I have done with my company. The problem with this is that it may be sustainable, but it's not scalable in the same way as high-growth tech startups are. It's very time consuming to add consultancy value. The expert is just you, and it doesn't scale. There might be some conflicts of interest because maybe you want to keep some of the information from spreading in the open because you want to make it more valuable or the other way around you want to influence the project differently because of your commercial interests. Or the other way around, the desire to help open-source projects can damage your business. Many times, I crippled my own business because I was eager to disclose stuff or get freebies or free lessons, free workshops, a lot of information very valuable just dumped. Also, there's a huge cognitive dissonance inside the company. Half the company was part-time uncle scrooge and part-time santa clause. It was very schizophrenic-- I'm giving everything away for free, but you have to pay, etc. It's very confusing. The accountants were going crazy because it's confusing.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"The third possible model is the Linux Foundation model where you're a non-profit company. The for-profit company just donates some of the profit to a separate entity with the specific goal to use the money to boost the development of open-source software. This is nice because it causes less confusion. This also has some cons. It is very centralized because you cannot have 20 Linux Foundations. You can have 20 Redhat style companies but you can't have 20 Linux Foundations.

    "summary": "Alena Vranova, a pioneer in the Bitcoin community since 2010, shared her insights on enhancing Bitcoin's development and adoption through coordinated efforts. Despite Bitcoin's inherent strength and independence from centralized governance, Vranova recognizes the short-term advantages that centralized organizations like the Ethereum Foundation have brought to technological adoption through effective marketing strategies. She has observed a trend at blockchain events where market participants are drawn to less effective technologies due to hype, revealing a significant communication gap that Bitcoin must bridge. Despite its superior infrastructure and advancements post-SegWit deployment, Bitcoin's complexity and the speculative nature of ICOs have made it less attractive to various stakeholders, including investors and developers.\n\nIn response to these observations, Vranova proposed a more structured approach to support Bitcoin's growth, suggesting the creation of a foundation dedicated to streamlining development, education, and adoption efforts. Drawing upon different models of supporting open-source development, she critiqued their sustainability and scalability, highlighting the limitations of strategies such as hold-and-build, the Redhat model, and the Linux Foundation model. This led to the inception of The B Foundation alongside Giacomo Zucco and others, aiming to foster Bitcoin and Lightning Network development by acting as a bridge between donors and projects. With plans to base the foundation in Liechtenstein, The B Foundation seeks to uphold principles of transparency, accountability, and long-term sustainability while maintaining the decentralization and privacy intrinsic to Bitcoin's ethos.\n\nVranova's vision extends beyond consolidating support for Bitcoin; she aims to debunk myths surrounding the cryptocurrency, enhance user experience with innovative solutions, and attract a wider audience through creative initiatives like Satoshka, a comic strip character embodying a Bitcoin hero. Furthermore, she is committed to fostering new talent in the field by partnering with universities to provide scholarships for bitcoin coding training, aiming to train at least 500 developers. Recognizing the importance of advancing Bitcoin's technological capabilities, Vranova has set an ambitious goal of donating at least $1 million in BTC towards research and development in areas such as privacy, fungibility, and smart functionality.\n\nVranova invites the broader community to support these initiatives through engagement on social media, direct communication, and financial contributions, despite facing regulatory hurdles like KYC requirements for larger donations. Her comprehensive approach reflects a commitment to not only expanding the reach and understanding of Bitcoin but also catalyzing innovation within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Through these endeavors, Vranova and her collaborators aim to bring about a more inclusive, technologically advanced, and widely understood cryptocurrency landscape, ensuring Bitcoin's prominence and viability as a leading cryptocurrency in the future."
