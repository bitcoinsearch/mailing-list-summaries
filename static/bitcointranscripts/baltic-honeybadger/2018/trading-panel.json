I don't even charge that much, I paid 20x more for when I learned the stay stuff. When people ask me for a discount because it's expensive, you should not be traidng at all. It's like gambling.

I did in the past and it worked pretty well for me. I'm from Germany, so the German tax law basically incentives hodling. If I buy a coin for whatever reason and I hold it for at least 12 months, I basically pay almost no taxes on those gains. I'm really incentivized to do a lot of research into coins and drifted in this direction. I'm using TA to improve my entries.

I'm not going to FOMO in. I put my sales in at the same time. Everyone has a different strategy. It's important to develop one strategy and stick with it. As to what exactly I use, it's a combination of TA and FA. For exchanges, for altcoins, I use poloniex still. Bitrex, I try to avoid Binance. Sometimes Bitfinex. For bitcoin, I use bitstamp.

If you're a good options trader, you can get even more leverage than that. I was looking forward to bitmax. I was a beta customers back in 2014. The winner was going to get 1 bitcoin. I came in 6th or 4th back in that, in a one month trading competition with testnet coins. Then I was trading on bitmex because I liked the futures market. I always want to avoid the mtgox situation. I don't like giving up my private keys. My liquidation point where I get automatically liquidated, I transfer whatever I'm going to trade. At one point one BTC was $300, so I would put 1 or 2 BTC on a trade and my liquidation was my stop loss and I would time it that way based on leverage because I don't want to use any coins on any exchange. It's too risky. I have 15 years of trading experience. Eventually, you're going to tred water, you might make some money, but ultimately you want to trade the least possible. The more you trade, it's more risky. I make about 4-8 trades per year. You want to be patient. It's like playing poker. Just play the top 4-5 hands that you know you're going to win.

I know how to read code bases and I can estimate how capable the developers are and stuff like that. I basically, at one point, it turned into a nightmare and I had 160 different coins on different exchanges and also local wallets...

    "summary": "In a riveting podcast, experts Florian Maier, Tone Vays, Whalepanda, and Matthew Mezinskis engaged in a deep dive into the nuanced world of cryptocurrency trading versus holding, particularly amidst the challenging bear market conditions. The conversation began with personal narratives that laid the foundation for their insights into the crypto realm. Tone Vays brought his traditional Wall Street acumen to the cryptocurrency sector around 2013, navigating through both trading and education within this volatile community. Whalepanda positioned himself as a monetary bitcoin maximalist, leveraging trading of various cryptocurrencies to bolster his bitcoin reserves, despite viewing other tokens with skepticism. Florian Maier, coming from an IT and open-source background, ventured into cryptocurrency trading with an aim similar to Whalepanda\u2019s: accumulating more bitcoin by trading altcoins.\n\nThe discussion pivoted to the core debate of trading versus \"hodling.\" Whalepanda championed hodling, pointing out the high risks and potential for losses inherent in trading. This sentiment was echoed by Tone Vays who likened trading to gambling and underscored the necessity for education and prudence in trading endeavors. They highlighted how a bear market mercilessly tests traders, contrasting sharply with the misleading ease of profiting during bull markets. Echoing these views, Florian Maier recounted his own experiences with the stress and losses associated with day trading, advocating for a cautious, long-term investment strategy.\n\nOn strategies, Florian Maier expressed a preference for hodling, motivated partly by favorable German tax laws, and the use of technical analysis to identify opportune market entry points. Whalepanda discussed setting long positions and eschewing FOMO, underlining the importance of developing and sticking to a personalized strategy. With his background in traditional trading, Tone Vays stressed patience and the wisdom of making a few well-considered trades annually over frequent, impulsive transactions.\n\nFurther, the conversation delved into the strategies for categorizing altcoins and tailoring trading approaches to different market caps and liquidity levels. Whalepanda and Florian Maier explored their criteria for selecting coins, focusing on aspects like trading volume and technological intrigue, particularly with privacy-centric coins. This segment underscored the diversity in trading strategies and the critical role of individual research and decision-making in trading success.\n\nA significant portion of the dialogue was dedicated to expressing skepticism towards AI and bot trading. Tone Vays voiced doubts about the efficacy of algorithmic strategies against human and institutional players, emphasizing the difficulty in keeping successful strategies proprietary given the transparency of trading platforms and insider access to trade data. Both Whalepanda and Florian Maier shared this skepticism, preferring manual trading strategies over automated ones.\n\nIn wrapping up, the podcast illuminated the complex landscape of cryptocurrency trading, with a consensus leaning towards the merits of caution, education, and the value of hodling. The speakers provided a comprehensive overview of the challenges and strategies pertinent to traders in the volatile cryptocurrency market, emphasizing the importance of a personal strategy, ongoing learning, and careful selection of trading opportunities.\n\nThe discussion also touched upon future developments in cryptocurrency trading, including skepticism towards trading bots and optimism regarding regulatory progress and the advent of professional trading platforms. Tone Vays shed light on his preference for established brokers offering bitcoin trading, noting the potential of platforms like Bakkt in integrating bitcoin into traditional trading infrastructures. Whalepanda pointed out the rise of exchanges aimed at institutional traders, anticipated to launch fully licensed platforms offering advanced financial instruments. Florian Maier looked forward to advancements in trading tools and analytics, stressing the need for reliable historical data and comprehensive indices.
