the Bitcoin Whitepaper, is on the blockchain in its entirety.\\nAnd this was done in a very, very, very inefficient way, which is by creating fake transactions.\\nAnd in those fake transactions, you're not spending to real, other people, to real addresses.\\nYou're creating fake addresses that you can actually interpret and then you can reconstruct a file from it.\\nSo this would be, for example, multisig addresses.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum: 00:04:07\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"The idea is that addresses, as our listeners will probably know, they're just a bunch of numbers and letters.\\nThey're effectively a number in the end.\\nAnd you're manipulating these addresses, you're just creating addresses.\\nEven though you don't have the private key, you're sending some coins to these and a special software can interpret these numbers and turn them into whatever data you want.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost: 00:04:33\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Pretty much.\\nSo we addressed addresses in an earlier episode, but in this case, the thing you're sending to wouldn't even be an address.\\nIt's a script that you put directly in the output of a transaction, and that gives you a lot of space to put stuff in.\\nThe technicalities don't really matter.\\nBut exactly, there is no private key with which to spend these coins.\\nBecause the public key, or even the hash of the public key, was generated as if it wasn't really a public key.\\nIt was just a series of bytes that look like a public key, but actually just contain the contents of a file.\\nAnd this means that money is unspendable, which is very annoying.\\nAnd the reason for that is, we have this thing called the UTXO set.\\nThe UTXO set is the set of coins that exist on the blockchain that can be spent by anyone and nodes keep that in RAM.\\nSo when a new block comes in, the node will check whether or not it's spending money that actually exists.\\nAnd this check is done using the UTXO set, which generally is kept in RAM, could be 10 gigabytes.\\nAnd so it's very annoying when there's something in that blob of memory that everybody needs to keep track of, that has no meaning, that can never be spent because the node doesn't know it can't be spent.\\nThe node just thinks anytime somebody could spend this, even though we know, no, it's the Bitcoin PDF, you can't spend it.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum: 00:05:54\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"What you're saying so far is that people were using, basically abusing the Bitcoin system in a way.\\nThey were manipulating addresses and sending coins to these addresses, not a lot, but just some coins to have these addresses on the blockchain.\\nThat translated into data that could be images or the Bitcoin Whitepaper or other pieces of text or memes or whatever people felt like they were uploading.\\nNormal Bitcoin software can't really tell the difference, normal Bitcoin software just sees addresses.\\nSo now all these normal Bitcoin nodes like mine and yours and all our listeners' who are running Bitcoin nodes, they actually have to check the coins on these addresses.\\nAm I saying that right?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost: 00:06:36\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"They have to keep those addresses in mind.\\nSo there's two things that happen.\\nBecause these things were put in the blockchain, well, you have to download the blockchain.\\nSo that's just wasted bandwidth for downloading, but that's not too bad.\\nThe problem is that it has to be interpreted as potentially valid coins.\\nAnd as an optimization, you want to keep in memory those coins that could potentially be spent and there's no way to drop them from memory.\\nAt least there wasn't.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Ruben Somsen: 00:06:59\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So the problem is that you think they are spendable as a regular full node, but actually they are not.\\nBut there's no way of knowing, other than kind of externally figuring out, that this is just a Whitepaper.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost: 00:07:12\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"You couldn't add that to the node, right?\\nIf say, we made a change to the Bitcoin Core that says, \\\"You know what?

I don't have to remember this.\\nAnd the idea there was, that it was kind of a compromise.\\nPeople are going to put spam on the blockchain, whether we like it or not.\\nLet's at least reduce the amount of damage they're doing and make sure they pay a reasonable fee for it as well.\\nSo there are some restrictions on the size of `OP_RETURN` to make sure that it's not too cheap to use it, but it is also cheaper than just spamming a blockchain.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum: 00:10:21\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So I guess we're still sort of unhappy about it, but if people are going to do it anyways, then this is the least damaging way of doing it.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost: 00:10:28\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"This, at least pays fees when you do this and nodes only have to download it.\\nBut they can throw it away, they don't have to remember it so the resource wasting is just a little bit of bandwidth and one off CPU, but it's not wasting people's RAM and RAM is probably one of the more scarce resources.\\nSo it's fine, it can't be done any better.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Ruben Somsen: 00:10:51\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"The main thing is it doesn't enter the UTXO sets and therefore it is a lot better than the previous solution.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum: 00:10:58\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So how much data fits into one of these `OP_RETURN`s?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost: 00:11:03\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"80 bytes.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Ruben Somsen: 00:11:04\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes and no, because I think that's not a consensus rule, that's just a propagation rule.\\nSo I believe it's actually valid to create one with more data, but then it won't be propagated.\\nSo yeah, practically speaking, you're right.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum: 00:11:20\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"But...can we do better?\\nCan we compress it somehow?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost: 00:11:23\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah we could, no well, I think I know where you want to go, towards the so-called Merkle tree.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum: 00:11:29\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes please.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost: 00:11:30\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"But I think we want to go somewhere else first, because we can talk about the kind of fun things you can put in `OP_RETURN` and then have meaning without actually compressing it.\\nSo we'll get to the compression part later.\\nSo let's say you really like Rare Pepe.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Ruben Somsen: 00:11:48\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I know I do.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost: 00:11:49\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So Rare Pepe was a trading card system on the blockchain and the way it worked is you could have a card and then you could offer it for sale.\\nAnd somebody could buy it and then, that other people would have the card and they could sell it, etc.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum: 00:12:04\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"When you say card, you mean image.\\nIt's a digital image.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost: 00:12:10\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes, but in this case it's important to note that the image is not on the blockchain.\\nThere's a reference to the image on the blockchain, the hash of the image.\\nI wouldn't still not call that compression, but I would say you're not spamming the blockchain with the entire image.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum: 00:12:24\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors, explain this to someone who's new because it sounds like it makes no sense at all.\\nYou have an image and then you have a hash and they have it on the blockchain.\\nWhy should people care about the hash or the image or any of this?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost: 00:12:36\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Well, this is exactly what's going on with the NFT hype nowadays.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum: 00:12:39\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"That's why I'm asking.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost: 00:12:41\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I would say there's no reason to care about this, but people were doing it.\\nSo we just have to sort of explain at least what they were doing.\\nWhat you would do is you would have this image somewhere, maybe on a web server, or maybe on your own computer.\\nEverybody would have access to this image because it's just data.\\nBut the question is, \\\"who really owns the image? Whatever it means to \\\"own\\\" the image\\\".\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum: 00:13:05\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"That sounds like an important question though, \\\"What does that mean?\\\", but go on.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost: 00:13:09\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I think it meant absolutely nothing but the way it was done was everybody would have the image.\\nAnd you could take the hash of the image and then the hash of the image would be on the blockchain.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum: 00:13:21\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Let me give you an example where I think it might possibly make sense.\\nIf you're playing something, I've never played this, but you've got something like Magic the Gathering.\\nIf you'd want to make that into a digital version, then you could somehow prove that you own a specific card if you want to play it against another player.\\nIf it's just an image, then everyone would have all the cards all the time.\\nSo now if you use...\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost: 00:13:46\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Well,

{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Ruben Somsen: 00:13:58\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I think it does make sense in some limited contexts.\\nBut the main thing is, is there going to be some kind of person who controls the NFT.\\nIf somebody issued it or they can issue more of it, then it becomes kind of questionable.\\nBut if it's like a one-time thing, like maybe somebody made a card game and it's just kind of like a full node where you download the software's open source and then the software interprets the NFTs.\\nAnd as long as everybody kind of agrees on the card game and the NFTs, then you have a card game, like you said, with cards that are actually rare.\\nBut anyone can just take the same game and play it for free, right?\\nSo that's always inevitable.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost: 00:14:40\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Which is pretty much how this Counterparty/Rare Pepe system worked, as far as I know.\\nSo basically, you would put on the blockchain, the hash of the image, probably.\\nAnd then you would say, \\\"Well, I'm now transferring this to this other person by just sending them coins essentially\\\".\\nAnd then whoever has the private key of where you sent the card is now the new owner.\\nAnd so you would have a piece of software that would read the blockchain and would see okay this card is now moved to this other person and it's moved again.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum: 00:15:07\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I want to take a small step back, and Ruben, this is

what colored coins are and then we'll move on back to NFTs.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Ruben Somsen: 00:15:24\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"It is very similar because a NFT is a colored coin of one, basically.\\nSo it really is just the issuance of an asset.\\nThe name colored coin has been kind of what's been used I think it's been maybe Counterparty was the first or...\"},

coins?\\nBecause I think technically they do, you could issue coins.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost: 00:16:00\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Counterparty can do colored coins, among other things, but colored coins was a system on its own.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Ruben Somsen: 00:16:05\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I see, okay.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost: 00:16:06\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"The example I once even used, I think, was called Bits of Bullion.\\nThere was a trust, like a UK or whatever Cayman Islands structure, probably Gibraltar.\\nAnd this trust owned gold in the real world and then this trust had basically had its own bylaws and it would define the beneficiaries of the trust.\\nThe nice thing about a trust is like nobody really owns the trust.\\nThe trust simply exists and you create it and you set it in motion and then it kind of just exists out there.\\nIt's kind of a cool legal structure.\\nBut basically this trust would own gold and then there would be an instruction in the bylaws of the trust that says, well, \\\"There's this colored coin out there on the blockchain with this and this block hash or this and this transaction hash\\\".\\n\\\"And whoever owns descendants of this original transaction is actually a beneficiary of the trust

10,000 Satoshis and they would say every Satoshi represents one gram of bullion in this specific vault at Brinks.\\nAnd then if you were to buy this gold, you could basically go to whatever, an

very brittle because you need to use a special wallet that understands these coins and keeps them separate.\\nIf you put those Satoshis in a regular wallet, it doesn't understand it, it will just

transaction mechanism.\\nYou just combine these Satoshis and move them around.\\nBut the Rare Pepe used more like a series of instructions.\\nI think, two things that it used.\\nA series of instructions where you could say, create a new asset and do something with it.\\nBut also if the asset moved on the blockchain, I guess it would also move.\\nI've never really studied it in enough detail to completely understand.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Ruben Somsen: 00:19:40\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I'm not entirely certain whether or not Satoshis were moving and

sure that's not the case.\\nI think they just used the data from the `OP_RETURN`s, and that data just meant something else within the Counterparty context.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost: 00:19:57\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"But at least the new owner was probably done using who got the coins.\\nLike, which private key received what.\\nI'm not sure how they would do it.\\nMaybe the transaction might have two outputs and one output would be `OP_RETURN` and the other would go to some address.\\nAnd then, I don't know, somebody gave me the source code.\\nIt

    "body": "## Intro\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:01:45\n\nLive, from Utrecht, this is The Van Wirdum Sjorsnado.\nHello.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:01:48\n\nHello.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:01:49\n\nHey, who's there?\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:01:51\n\nIt's another Dutch guy.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:01:53\n\nWelcome to the show, Ruben.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:01:54\n\nThank you.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:01:56\n\nWelcome back Ruben.\nRuben, did you start selling your tweets yet?\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:01:59\n\nI tried to sell one of my tweets to my sister but she said, \"What the hell are you doing?\" and then she just laughed at me, so I failed.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:02:06\n\nWhich rule of acquisition is it, exploitation begins at home?\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:02:10\n\nExactly, family is who you gotta exploit first, right?\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:02:15\n\nSjors, did you make any good deals?\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:02:17\n\nUh, no.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:02:19\n\nWe are actually gonna discuss NFTs today.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:02:21\n\nI have been making some really bad price predictions because I hope those tweets will become worth a lot.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:02:25\n\nBad price predictions?\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:02:26\n\nYeah, bad takes usually make more money than good takes.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:02:29\n\nAh, I didn't know that.\nThat's a good tip.\nPro tip.\nBut anyways, we are kind of discussing NFTs today, aren't we?\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:02:35\n\nYes, we are.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:02:36\n\nNot exactly, but partly.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:02:39\n\nVery exactly, amongst other things.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:02:42\n\nRGB, that's what it's called, right?\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:02:45\n\nThat's right.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:02:47\n\nJogged my memory there.\nWhat does it stand for, guys?\nRGB?\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:02:50\n\nWell, I think it's just a reference to the color scheme - Red, Green, Blue.\nBut it doesn't actually mean anything in the context that we're going to talk about it.\nIt's just the letters.\nUnless they made it a backronym, I don't know.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:03:02\n\nNo, no, I don't think there's an acronym.\nIt's referring to colored coins, right?\nSo the colored coin idea of having other coins on the Bitcoin blockchain, the word color, RGB, that's how it's connected.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:03:13\n\nClever.\nI didn't know that.\nOkay, so we're gonna discuss RGB tokens today.\nWait, is it RGB?\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:03:21\n\nThe RGB System.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:03:22\n\nThe RGB System.\nOkay, where do we start?\nRuben?\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:03:25\n\nWell, that's a good question.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:03:26\n\nI think we should start with\u2026\nA very, very long time ago in a blockchain far away.\nIt was really, really, really cheap to make transactions and people thought they could put everything on the blockchain.\nFor example, the Bitcoin PDF - the Bitcoin Whitepaper, is on the blockchain in its entirety.\nAnd this was done in a very, very, very inefficient way, which is by creating fake transactions.\nAnd in those fake transactions, you're not spending to real, other people, to real addresses.\nYou're creating fake addresses that you can actually interpret and then you can reconstruct a file from it.\nSo this would be, for example, multisig addresses.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:04:07\n\nThe idea is that addresses, as our listeners will probably know, they're just a bunch of numbers and letters.\nThey're effectively a number in the end.\nAnd you're manipulating these addresses, you're just creating addresses.\nEven though you don't have the private key, you're sending some coins to these and a special software can interpret these numbers and turn them into whatever data you want.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:04:33\n\nPretty much.\nSo we addressed addresses in an earlier episode, but in this case, the thing you're sending to wouldn't even be an address.\nIt's a script that you put directly in the output of a transaction, and that gives you a lot of space to put stuff in.\nThe technicalities don't really matter.\nBut exactly, there is no private key with which to spend these coins.\nBecause the public key, or even the hash of the public key, was generated as if it wasn't really a public key.\nIt was just a series of bytes that look like a public key, but actually just contain the contents of a file.\nAnd this means that money is unspendable, which is very annoying.\nAnd the reason for that is, we have this thing called the UTXO set.\nThe UTXO set is the set of coins that exist on the blockchain that can be spent by anyone and nodes keep that in RAM.\nSo when a new block comes in, the node will check whether or not it's spending money that actually exists.\nAnd this check is done using the UTXO set, which generally is kept in RAM, could be 10 gigabytes.\nAnd so it's very annoying when there's something in that blob of memory that everybody needs to keep track of, that has no meaning, that can never be spent because the node doesn't know it can't be spent.\nThe node just thinks anytime somebody could spend this, even though we know, no, it's the Bitcoin PDF, you can't spend it.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:05:54\n\nWhat you're saying so far is that people were using, basically abusing the Bitcoin system in a way.\nThey were manipulating addresses and sending coins to these addresses, not a lot, but just some coins to have these addresses on the blockchain.\nThat translated into data that could be images or the Bitcoin Whitepaper or other pieces of text or memes or whatever people felt like they were uploading.\nNormal Bitcoin software can't really tell the difference, normal Bitcoin software just sees addresses.\nSo now all these normal Bitcoin nodes like mine and yours and all our listeners' who are running Bitcoin nodes, they actually have to check the coins on these addresses.\nAm I saying that right?\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:06:36\n\nThey have to keep those addresses in mind.\nSo there's two things that happen.\nBecause these things were put in the blockchain, well, you have to download the blockchain.\nSo that's just wasted bandwidth for downloading, but that's not too bad.\nThe problem is that it has to be interpreted as potentially valid coins.\nAnd as an optimization, you want to keep in memory those coins that could potentially be spent and there's no way to drop them from memory.\nAt least there wasn't.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:06:59\n\nSo the problem is that you think they are spendable as a regular full node, but actually they are not.\nBut there's no way of knowing, other than kind of externally figuring out, that this is just a Whitepaper.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:07:12\n\nYou couldn't add that to the node, right?\nIf say, we made a change to the Bitcoin Core that says, \"You know what? We know that's the Whitepaper, let's just skip those coins\".\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:07:22\n\nI guess theoretically you could throw it out of UTXO sets if you're certain they're unspendable.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:07:27\n\nThat's the problem.\nIf you're certain, what if some really really smart alien actually made it look like it's just the Whitepaper,\nbut no no no, there are private keys for it and one day this alien tries to spend the Whitepaper and we accidentally soft fork those coins out of existence and this alien gets really angry because he's like, \"Hey, you can't just confiscate my money!\"\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:07:48\n\nThat sounds like an ECDSA break, but I'm not sure.\nDepends on, I guess, how it's done.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:07:53\n\nMaybe the person who created the Whitepaper actually generated lots of public keys from private keys and then reordered them in such a way that it created a readable Whitepaper.\nI don't think that's even practical.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:08:07\n\nNo, but to your point, maybe there is a way in which it is actually valid and we can't be 100% certain.\nBut one thing I wanted to add...\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:08:14\n\nThere's also a thing of where do you draw the line, because we do have vanity addresses and you can sort of use that as well to create stuff.\nAt what point are you sure it's a vanity address and at what point...\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:08:26\n\nWell, that would be absolutely unacceptable.\nThe idea that you can't just decide what is vanity and what should be thrown away.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:08:33\n\nThat's my point, I agree.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:08:35\n\nBut if you could mathematically prove that a coin cannot be spent, like theoretically impossible to be spent, then you could have that discussion.\nBut the problem is we can't really prove that.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:08:45\n\nOne thing that I wanted to add is that it is actually important, that if you want to put data on the Bitcoin blockchain, it needs to be a valid transaction.\nThat's why we're talking about these addresses.\nBecause you can't just take the Bitcoin Whitepaper, just put it there and just be like, \"Hey, please put this in the blockchain!\"\nNo, you need to do it in a format that the blockchain recognizes and that's how you end up with these addresses.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:09:11\n\nThat was the original problem, people were just bloating the blockchain with all sorts of nonsense that most of us don't care about and we still need to all validate it and store it or whatever.\nThat needs to be solved, Sjors.\nHow do we solve that?\n\n## What is `OP_RETURN`?\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:09:26\n\nWell this was solved many many years ago using something called `OP_RETURN`.\nAnd the idea of `OP_RETURN` is that you create a transaction that spends coins.\nAnd then it produces a \"coin\", which has the instruction `OP_RETURN` and then it's followed by whatever text you want to put on the blockchain.\nAnd now when a full node sees this it knows, okay, if it starts with `OP_RETURN`, this coin is not spendable.\nTherefore, this coin is not spendable, so I can forget about it.\nI do not have to put this in my RAM. I don't have to remember this.\nAnd the idea there was, that it was kind of a compromise.\nPeople are going to put spam on the blockchain, whether we like it or not.\nLet's at least reduce the amount of damage they're doing and make sure they pay a reasonable fee for it as well.\nSo there are some restrictions on the size of `OP_RETURN` to make sure that it's not too cheap to use it, but it is also cheaper than just spamming a blockchain.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:10:21\n\nSo I guess we're still sort of unhappy about it, but if people are going to do it anyways, then this is the least damaging way of doing it.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:10:28\n\nThis, at least pays fees when you do this and nodes only have to download it.\nBut they can throw it away, they don't have to remember it so the resource wasting is just a little bit of bandwidth and one off CPU, but it's not wasting people's RAM and RAM is probably one of the more scarce resources.\nSo it's fine, it can't be done any better.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:10:51\n\nThe main thing is it doesn't enter the UTXO sets and therefore it is a lot better than the previous solution.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:10:58\n\nSo how much data fits into one of these `OP_RETURN`s?\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:11:03\n\n80 bytes.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:11:04\n\nYes and no, because I think that's not a consensus rule, that's just a propagation rule.\nSo I believe it's actually valid to create one with more data, but then it won't be propagated.\nSo yeah, practically speaking, you're right.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:11:20\n\nBut...can we do better?\nCan we compress it somehow?\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:11:23\n\nYeah we could, no well, I think I know where you want to go, towards the so-called Merkle tree.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:11:29\n\nYes please.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:11:30\n\nBut I think we want to go somewhere else first, because we can talk about the kind of fun things you can put in `OP_RETURN` and then have meaning without actually compressing it.\nSo we'll get to the compression part later.\nSo let's say you really like Rare Pepe.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:11:48\n\nI know I do.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:11:49\n\nSo Rare Pepe was a trading card system on the blockchain and the way it worked is you could have a card and then you could offer it for sale.\nAnd somebody could buy it and then, that other people would have the card and they could sell it, etc.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:12:04\n\nWhen you say card, you mean image.\nIt's a digital image.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:12:10\n\nYes, but in this case it's important to note that the image is not on the blockchain.\nThere's a reference to the image on the blockchain, the hash of the image.\nI wouldn't still not call that compression, but I would say you're not spamming the blockchain with the entire image.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:12:24\n\nSjors, explain this to someone who's new because it sounds like it makes no sense at all.\nYou have an image and then you have a hash and they have it on the blockchain.\nWhy should people care about the hash or the image or any of this?\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:12:36\n\nWell, this is exactly what's going on with the NFT hype nowadays.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:12:39\n\nThat's why I'm asking.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:12:41\n\nI would say there's no reason to care about this, but people were doing it.\nSo we just have to sort of explain at least what they were doing.\nWhat you would do is you would have this image somewhere, maybe on a web server, or maybe on your own computer.\nEverybody would have access to this image because it's just data.\nBut the question is, \"who really owns the image? Whatever it means to \"own\" the image\".\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:13:05\n\nThat sounds like an important question though, \"What does that mean?\", but go on.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:13:09\n\nI think it meant absolutely nothing but the way it was done was everybody would have the image.\nAnd you could take the hash of the image and then the hash of the image would be on the blockchain.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:13:21\n\nLet me give you an example where I think it might possibly make sense.\nIf you're playing something, I've never played this, but you've got something like Magic the Gathering.\nIf you'd want to make that into a digital version, then you could somehow prove that you own a specific card if you want to play it against another player.\nIf it's just an image, then everyone would have all the cards all the time.\nSo now if you use...\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:13:46\n\nWell, that's the idea.\nYou prove that you have the image.\nWhatever \"having\" means.\n\nBut at least if everybody agrees on the rules, then you can do that.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:13:54\n\nSo within some contexts, it might actually make some sense.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:13:58\n\nI think it does make sense in some limited contexts.\nBut the main thing is, is there going to be some kind of person who controls the NFT.\nIf somebody issued it or they can issue more of it, then it becomes kind of questionable.\nBut if it's like a one-time thing, like maybe somebody made a card game and it's just kind of like a full node where you download the software's open source and then the software interprets the NFTs.\nAnd as long as everybody kind of agrees on the card game and the NFTs, then you have a card game, like you said, with cards that are actually rare.\nBut anyone can just take the same game and play it for free, right?\nSo that's always inevitable.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:14:40\n\nWhich is pretty much how this Counterparty/Rare Pepe system worked, as far as I know.\nSo basically, you would put on the blockchain, the hash of the image, probably.\nAnd then you would say, \"Well, I'm now transferring this to this other person by just sending them coins essentially\".\nAnd then whoever has the private key of where you sent the card is now the new owner.\nAnd so you would have a piece of software that would read the blockchain and would see okay this card is now moved to this other person and it's moved again.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:15:07\n\nI want to take a small step back, and Ruben, this is also something you wanted to discuss.\nIt is the idea of colored coins, so we already mentioned it in the beginning of the episode.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:15:16\n\nYeah.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:15:17\n\nSo the idea of colored coins, Ruben can you explain what colored coins are and then we'll move on back to NFTs.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:15:24\n\nIt is very similar because a NFT is a colored coin of one, basically.\nSo it really is just the issuance of an asset.\nThe name colored coin has been kind of what's been used I think it's been maybe Counterparty was the first or...\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:15:42\n\nNo, Counterparty is not a colored coin.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:15:43\n\nColored coins predate Counterparty.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:15:45\n\nYeah, there's \u201cMaster Coin\u201d, I don't know, but...\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:15:48\n\nI can give you an example of a colored coin, if you want, but first explain how it works.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:15:53\n\nAre you saying that Counterparty doesn't have colored coins?\nBecause I think technically they do, you could issue coins.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:16:00\n\nCounterparty can do colored coins, among other things, but colored coins was a system on its own.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:16:05\n\nI see, okay.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:16:06\n\nThe example I once even used, I think, was called Bits of Bullion.\nThere was a trust, like a UK or whatever Cayman Islands structure, probably Gibraltar.\nAnd this trust owned gold in the real world and then this trust had basically had its own bylaws and it would define the beneficiaries of the trust.\nThe nice thing about a trust is like nobody really owns the trust.\nThe trust simply exists and you create it and you set it in motion and then it kind of just exists out there.\nIt's kind of a cool legal structure.\nBut basically this trust would own gold and then there would be an instruction in the bylaws of the trust that says, well, \"There's this colored coin out there on the blockchain with this and this block hash or this and this transaction hash\".\n\"And whoever owns descendants of this original transaction is actually a beneficiary of the trust legally\".\n\"And so he's entitled to that gold, to be able to redeem it\", if they wanted to.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:17:07\n\nWhat you're saying is basically that there is a UTXO on the Bitcoin blockchain.\nAnd somebody basically said, \"Hey, if you own parts of the coins that are in here then you also have ownership over something else\".\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:17:21\n\nFor example, they might start with 10,000 Satoshis and they would say every Satoshi represents one gram of bullion in this specific vault at Brinks.\nAnd then if you were to buy this gold, you could basically go to whatever, an exchange, you would send the right amount of Bitcoin or fiat.\nAnd then they would send you 30 Satoshis, now you'd own 30 grams of gold.\nSo if you send those exact same 30 Satoshis back, you could redeem it, but you could also send those 30 Satoshis to somebody else.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:17:52\n\nThe coins, the Satoshis, were colored, basically.\nSo it's where the naming comes from, right?\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:17:57\n\nActually, and this is very very brittle because you need to use a special wallet that understands these coins and keeps them separate.\nIf you put those Satoshis in a regular wallet, it doesn't understand it, it will just spend it.\nAnd your entire scheme, you just destroyed your gold.\nBut this really exists, so it's kind of cool.\n2014 or 2015.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:18:16\n\nThe analogy I used when I tried to explain this to people is: Imagine you're organizing like a small festival and you go to the bank and you get a whole bunch of pennies.\nYou put special stickers on the pennies and at the festival you can use these pennies with the special stickers and they're worth a beer.\nIf you walk out of the festival with the pennies, then there's still worth the penny, but only a penny.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:18:41\n\nYeah, and if you accidentally try to give a guy a Euro, i.e. a hundred pennies, then you're screwed because you actually just gave him 100 beers.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:18:50\n\nExactly.\nIf that person knows how to get back to the festival, at least.\nYou're giving a new meaning to the Satoshis on the Bitcoin blockchain.\nThat's what colored coins are.\nAnd then we just discussed Rare Pepe and Pepe Cash and all that.\nAnd they did something similar, but they used `OP_RETURN` and it works technically in a bit of a different way, right?\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:19:12\n\nYeah, very much differently.\nThe colored coins really just use Bitcoin's normal transaction mechanism.\nYou just combine these Satoshis and move them around.\nBut the Rare Pepe used more like a series of instructions.\nI think, two things that it used.\nA series of instructions where you could say, create a new asset and do something with it.\nBut also if the asset moved on the blockchain, I guess it would also move.\nI've never really studied it in enough detail to completely understand.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:19:40\n\nI'm not entirely certain whether or not Satoshis were moving and they had meaning inside of Counterparty.\nI thought it did, but I'm not certain.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:19:47\n\nI'm pretty sure that's not the case.\nI think they just used the data from the `OP_RETURN`s, and that data just meant something else within the Counterparty context.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:19:57\n\nBut at least the new owner was probably done using who got the coins.\nLike, which private key received what.\nI'm not sure how they would do it.\nMaybe the transaction might have two outputs and one output would be `OP_RETURN` and the other would go to some address.\nAnd then, I don't know, somebody gave me the source code.\nIt doesn't matter because there's something new and better.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:20:18\n\nRGB, that's what the episode is about.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:20:20\n\nThat's right.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:20:20\n\nI think that's where we are now.\nWe discussed `OP_RETURN`, colored coins, the other thing, Counterparty.\nAnd that was all to get to RGB.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:20:31\n\nThat's right.\n\n## What Is RGB?\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:20:32\n\nSjors, what is RGB?\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:20:34\n\nOh, do I have to explain it?\nRuben was gonna explain it.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:20:37\n\nOkay, so with RGB, it's a very similar system in the sense that we still have these tokens that are being generated and they're being moved on the Bitcoin blockchain.\nBut what we're doing here is we're using the existing UTXOs as kind of a vessel, we add the coin there and we move the coins there.\nLet's say I have a UTXO and I have some RGB tokens in there.\nFirst I would have to generate them, but let's skip that for a second.\nThere's an output, it's mine.\nThere are 10 USD Tether RGB tokens in there.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:21:14\n\nWhen you say in there, what do you mean?\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:21:17\n\nThere needs to be some kind of genesis moment where the tokens were generated.\nThe whole point of this system is that it allows you to create tokens and then spend them.\nSo first, the USD Tether people would have to issue this token.\nGenerally, the way that's done in RGB is actually you do use an `OP_RETURN`.\nSo first, there's going to be a transaction.\nThe transaction has an `OP_RETURN`, so everybody can see it.\nAnd that transaction says, \"Hereby, I declare that now inside of this new UTXO there are just 1 million dollars worth of USD Tether\".\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:21:52\n\nThis is actually where your hash comes up, because what is in the `OP_RETURN`, as far as I know, is a hash of a JSON file.\nSo anybody who has the JSON file will know that the hash refers to it.\nAnd they can then read the JSON file and see what the supply is and what the rules are for whatever asset has been created.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:22:14\n\nA JSON file is just text, right?\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:22:17\n\nIt's just text with annoying brackets.\n\n## Client-Side Validation\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:22:20\n\nNow we have a UTXO with $1 million in their USD Tether dollars IOUs.\nThey first send them to a buyer, somebody who says, \"Okay, I'll give you $1,000, you give me $1,000 worth of these coins\".\nSo the first thing that RGB does, is client-side validation, meaning that the JSON file that Sjors just pointed out needs to be transferred during the coin transfer.\nAs soon as these coins move from one owner to the next owner, you also have to provide all the data, which refers to the hash that you put in the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:22:56\n\nSo the first person who buys the tether, basically, has to receive an email.\nAnd inside that email should be the JSON file, and I guess also a proof that they now own the coins.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:23:09\n\nThat's the big difference compared to colored coins, a Counterparty, is that now we have a separate layer, essentially, of JSON file texts that are also being sent around and they're being linked to in the Bitcoin blockchain.\nIs that right?\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:23:24\n\nYeah, and this also detaches the amount that's really being moved from the amount of Satoshis that's being moved.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:23:33\n\nBut I think that was already the case for Counterparty.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:23:35\n\nYeah, for Counterparty it is, but for colored coins it wasn't.\nFor colored coins, the Satoshis really mattered.\nBut in the case of RGB, you're just sending somebody a transaction and then along with the transaction, an email with what's actually happening.\nAnd that transaction might move one Satoshi or a thousand Satoshis, doesn't really matter.\nThe instructions are separate, and are not on the chain.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:23:54\n\nWe have this one output with $1 million worth of USD Tether, and now they want to send $1,000 to somebody else.\nWhat they do is they take that output and they spend it and they send it to another output.\nAnd it's still owned by the same USD Tether people who issued the first $1 million.\nBut inside of that output, there is a public key, that is the person who owns the UTXO.\nAnd through some cryptographic trickery that's very similar to Taproot, they add another hash inside of this new UTXO.\nAnd inside of this new hash there they point to an output where they want a certain amount of these coins to move.\nLet's say I was buying $1,000 worth of USD Tether.\nI would have to give an output to the USD Tether people, and then when they spend their output, they will point back to me with the committed data, and they say, \"Okay, now $1,000 are inside of Ruben's UTXO\".\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:24:59\n\nWho else can read this?\nCan I read this?\nHow do I know this transfer happened?\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:25:04\n\nThis is a hidden transfer in the sense that it's a commitment that's hidden inside of the public key.\nThe USD Tether people need to show the commitment to me so I can open a commitment, they can open a commitment and I can show the commitment to you, and it can prove that I have 1000 of these USD Tether coins.\nAnd that's what I would have to do if I want to then send $100 to you Aaron, then I would have to show that data.\nAnd that is the entire story of the client-side validation.\nThe entire history of the coin, in this case, the coins were created, then the coins were sent to me.\nI would have to show that entire history to you.\nAnd once you see the history and you're satisfied, you see (that) this is correct, Ruben DOES have 1000 of these USD Tether coins.\nOnly then will you accept another 100 from me.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:25:54\n\nAnd this is kind of nice because it creates a really selective privacy thing.\nAaron, you can see that you really got the 100 because you get all the history you need to confirm that.\nSo from the 1 million you see that 1000 was sent to Ruben and from that 1000, 100 was sent to you.\nYou can see all that.\nBut what happened to the rest of that 1 million you cannot see.\nI guess the only thing you'll be able to see is that 1 million minus 1000 was sent somewhere else.\nSo it wasn't increase, but you can't see what happened after that.\nYou can imagine history as a giant tree of transactions, but you only get everything that leads to your little branch in the universe.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:26:34\n\nSo this sounds like the RGB people are making an entirely different cryptocurrency system that's being anchored in the Bitcoin blockchain, right?\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:26:47\n\nYeah, I guess.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:26:48\n\nYeah.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:26:49\n\nI think this already came up, but did you mention this off-chain part of it, the JSON files?\nAre these actually sent through email?\nIs that actually how it works?\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:26:59\n\nYou can do whatever you want, but I believe there is a little like do-it-yourself web server that comes with it.\nAnd if you run that do-it-yourself web server, then your special wallet will actually know that it needs to send certain files to that web server.\nAnd it needs to fetch certain files from that web server in order to make sense of just the UTXOs.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:27:22\n\nSo it can all be automated, right?\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:27:24\n\nIn essence when you're using it, at least if the software is developed all the way to being nice, you would just say, \"I'm going to send a 10 Tether to you, you have a 100, Aaron, so you're going to send me 10\".\nI give you an address, you click, copy paste the address, you enter the number 10, you click send and it just works.\nOn your end, your wallet is uploading certain files to a server that has all the proofs, and on my end it's actually fetching files from the server to see all those proofs.\nIn the case of something like Tether, I guess it would make sense for the Tether Corporation to be hosting that server.\nBecause in the end, they decide what happens anyway.\nThey're the counterparty.\nYou're already trusting them, so it doesn't matter that they also host some data, which as far as I know, they can't really decode.\nSo it's still kind of nice from a privacy point of view.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:28:17\n\nBut it is important that you save your own data.\nBecause when I received the $1,000, then maybe Tether has that data as well, and I have the data.\nBut if the Tether company then stops cooperating, now I can't spend it without the data that they were holding for me.\nSo I need to hold my own data.\nI need to make sure that I have my entire history.\nSo at the very least, maybe if Tether cooperates, great, you can get the data through them.\nBut if they don't cooperate, I need to then go and show my data to you.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:28:50\n\nYeah, exactly.\nIt just means your backup is more than just your 12 words or 24 words.\nYou need the other data too.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:28:57\n\nThe \u201cHistory\u201d is basically your \u201cCoin\u201d.\nIf you don't have the history, you don't have your coins.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:29:03\n\nGot it.\nThis does sound like for every Tether transaction, I guess that's the example we decided to run with, for every Tether transaction in this RGB System, we need a Bitcoin transaction.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:29:17\n\nThe amounts don't have to match and the Bitcoin itself doesn't have to go from person to person, but you do need a unique Bitcoin transaction for every Tether transaction.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:29:28\n\nBut it's good to point out that it only has one input and one output.\nEven though only 1,000 of the $1 million went to me, on the Bitcoin blockchain, you'll have one input, one output, both owned by USD Tether.\nAnd then another output that was already mine, that was already on the blockchain, that's where the $1,000 go.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:29:51\n\nI guess that means you could piggyback.\nSo if you have to send money to an exchange anyway, well, I don't think you can tweak that.\nThen at least your input isn't duplicated, but you would have two outputs.\nOne that goes to the exchange and one that goes back to you which actually has some meaning in the RGB Protocol.\nEither way you don't need a lot of data to do this.\nVery small transactions and maybe you can piggyback on your normal transactions.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:30:16\n\nYou can combine it with a Bitcoin transaction that you were going to send anyway.\nAnd then also do an RGB transaction at the same time.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:30:23\n\nBut there's more.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:30:25\n\nCan we do better?\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:30:26\n\nWe can do better.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:30:27\n\nSjors, who's gonna explain how to do this better? Ruben? Sjors?\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:30:32\n\nI'm confused where we're going.\n\n## Using Lightning channels\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:30:33\n\nWe're going to use a concept from Ruben's little show called the lightning round.\nWe're not going to do a lightning round, but yeah, we can do better with Lightning.\nAt least in the example that we just talked about.\nBecause we talked about a fungible asset, so it doesn't matter which USD Tether you have, it's the same.\nWe previously talked about Rare Pepe, where it does matter what you have.\nWhat we're going to talk about only works for the fungible stuff.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:30:59\n\nEvery USD Tether is interchangeable.\nYou don't care which one you have.\nWhile when it comes to trading cards, you definitely care which one you have, that's the difference.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:31:09\n\nThat means that you can start basically creating Lightning channels where the coins in the channels are these special tokens.\nThough I'm a little vague on how exactly that works.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:31:19\n\nWell, so to be clear, that only applies to the fungible version - the Tether example we gave or the gold example we gave previously.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:31:27\n\nBut the awesome thing about that, is that it means that if you somehow get these Lightning channels to work with these colored tokens in it, we can start sending very small amounts of dollars back and forth indefinitely.\nAnd only when the channel needs to be closed, we create this Bitcoin transaction and send all the proofs that are needed just for that.\nSo it means that the metadata you need to keep isn't growing too quickly either.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:31:53\n\nRuben, RGB tokens on Lightning?\nDo you see it happening?\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:31:56\n\nThe way I look at Lightning is that it works for every blockchain, at least as long as they have timelock and maybe some kind of hashlock or pointlocks, whatever they're called...\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:32:09\n\nVery basic smart contracting tools.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:32:11\n\nI think it doesn't really matter what kind of blockchain you have.\nI think sooner or later, especially when scaling becomes an issue, you have to start using Lightning.\nI would say it works for every chain, it works for every kind of system.\nBut in this case, RGB is made very specifically to start working with Lightning as soon as possible.\nThey're really trying to make it happen right from the get-go.\nSpecific to NFTs, you can have them in a Lightning channel.\nSo maybe Sjors and I, we can open a lightning channel, but then we can only send the NFT to each other, basically.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:32:51\n\nThat's more like a regular payment channel, not a Lightning channel.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:32:53\n\nExactly.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:32:55\n\nSo how would you have collateral of the same NFT or you would split it then or?\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:32:59\n\nThere would be one NFT and it would be with me.\nAnd then every time we update the channel, I can then give the NFT to you and then you can give the NFT back to me, and we can go back and forth, but you cannot do the hops.\nWith Lightning, the whole point is that multiple people have channels and they can kind of send from one person's channel to another person's channel.\nAlice and Bob have a channel, Bob and Carol have a channel.\nSo then if Alice sends an NFT to Bob, Bob cannot send the same NFT to Carol because it's a different channel and the NFT doesn't exist in the other channel.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:33:33\n\nOf course you could tokenize the NFT, then the NFT itself would be divided into a thousand subunits, and whoever owns the majority of the subunits is actually in charge of the NFT.\nBut people can trade sub NFTs but let's...\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:33:47\n\nYou're unnecessarily complicating things now.\nYou're just inventing a new currency based on a single NFT.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:33:54\n\nA great business proposal.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:33:56\n\nLet me ask a concrete question about this.\nLet's keep focused on the fungible RGB tokens because these can be used in Lightning.\nWould that in that case mean that all of the hops need to actually also accept this fungible token as a fee to forward the payment?\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:34:15\n\nIn other words, do you need a Colored Lightning Network, like a completely separate network just for those colored ones?\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:34:21\n\nThe answer is yes and no.\nAt the very least, you need the incoming, like the first hop needs to have the token and the last hop needs to have the token.\nBut then all the intermediary hops, they don't necessarily, you can swap while doing, while inside of a Lightning channel.\nSo you could have a USD Tether to Bitcoin.\nAnd then another hop that remains Bitcoin.\nAnd then the final hop is Bitcoin to USD Tether again.\nIn that way, you could kind of lean on top of the existing Lightning network, but you would still need these in-points and out-points.\nAnd you would still need these swaps to take place.\nPeople that accept the swap.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:35:02\n\nIf you think Bitcoin Lightning is complicated, and you think atomic swaps are complicated.\nWell, you can do both and have something really complicated, but then you could indeed send US dollar values across the world instantly.\nEven if not everybody supports it.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:35:16\n\nYou say you can, but then there's sort of the other problem where hops on the network can decide not to forward and see what the exchange rate does in the meantime, based on that, then end up forwarding or not.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:35:29\n\nSpecifically ZmnSCPxj, put something on the mailing list saying, you basically have the American call option problem where you can either forward the payment or you can kind of wait and see what happens.\nSo the final person who is supposed to receive the payment can either accept it or they can wait.\nAnd then they can see if the price goes up or the price goes down and based on that they can decide whether or not they accept the payment.\nSo because of that it is actually problematic to do these atomic swaps between different currencies on the Lightning Network currently.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:36:11\n\nWhich is a problem in general.\nThe idea has been around to have a Lightning Network of Bitcoin that could be connected to a Lightning Network-ish on Ethereum.\nAnd you could just instantly swap between all these currencies.\nBut there are these kinds of problems there.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:36:24\n\nThen one other problem I think is that unless miners are actually gonna accept these fungible tokens in order to settle transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, which sounds like a stretch, they still need to have Bitcoin in the Lightning transactions that are using RGB and you need the fees for that.\nIt gets very complicated very fast.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:36:47\n\nI'm also wondering what the incentive structure is for accepting.\nYou have these cheap transactions and then you want to punish them.\nIf the monetary incentives in Bitcoin are not correct, because most of the value is actually represented by a token, which has its own exchange rate.\nI don't know what happens.\nThis is where [inaudible] make all the details.\nSorry about that.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:37:09\n\nIt's got to be a little difficult.\nBut, I don't think necessarily, at least the thing that Aaron was saying.\nYou can actually have a Lightning channel for Bitcoin.\nI assume even if you were an RGB user and you wanted to use it on Lightning, you would also want to use Bitcoin on Lightning.\nThat seems like a safe assumption.\nSo you could use the same UTXO for that.\nYou could have a channel that you're using to send bitcoins back and forth, and then you can also put RGB tokens inside of it and do the same thing at the same time with a single channel.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:37:39\n\nBut then it'd be kind of like a collateral.\nHow do you make sure that I don't end up with just five Satoshis in the channel, so I have every incentive to cheat, but there's a huge value of colored coins in it.\nSo somehow you do need to compare the real value that's at stake in Bitcoin versus this tokenized value.\nI think this gets pretty complicated.\nI don't know if we wanna...\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:38:00\n\nYeah, I'm not sure about that.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:38:02\n\nToo many worms for now.\nLet's move on to more worms.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:38:07\n\nDelicious.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:38:08\n\nThere were more problems, I think, Sjors.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:38:09\n\nI think Ruben had one final problem.\nThat's about it.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:38:13\n\nWhat we were saying earlier about the USD Tether...\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:38:16\n\nTo be clear, we're not talking about Lightning anymore.\nWe're just talking about RGB.\nWe're back to basic RGB, and there's a problem with it.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:38:24\n\nEven for the Lightning network, you still need to use the base layer.\nAnd that's something that people shouldn't forget.\nYou can't just be saying, \"Because we can go on Lightning, it doesn't really matter how expensive the base layer is\".\nYou always need to have these base layer transactions first.\nLots of people need to have USD Tether, then they have to create channels with USD Tether.\nAnd then you can start using the Lightning Network and even then, channels have to close and reopen and rebalance, etc., so you're still using the base layer.\nThe issue or the first issue would be, simply if the token moved many times you have to show the entire history to the person you are sending your coins to.\nMaybe at first it's like one megabyte, two megabytes, three megabytes, okay, fine.\nBut after a while, it becomes hundreds of megabytes or maybe even a gigabyte.\nAnd what's worse is that...\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:39:14\n\nWe did talk about how you only have to share the relevant part so I only need to see how my money originated from the source.\nBut I don't have to see the entire tree.\nThat saves a whole bunch of data.\nBut even then if the money is passed around a hundred thousand times, I need all those one hundred thousand transactions to see where it's coming from.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:39:34\n\nThe data does keep growing, regardless.\nThere is sort of an intermediate solution to that, depending on what kind of token you have.\nYou could give back the USD Tether to the USD Tether company, and then they could reissue a new token with a history that's completely clean again.\nBut that works only in the example of USD Tether where there's sort of an IOU system.\nI'm not sure what kind of token this would be, but if there's some kind of token that is issued once and then never issued again, then you can't do that.\nBut the problem is that the history of the tokens actually becomes intertwined.\nSo if I have 1 USDT, and let's say Sjors has 1 USDT, and we both send these to you, Aaron.\nThen the history of both these coins becomes connected, so the proof for your 2 dollars is both our histories.\nNow after that, if you want to split them up again, and now you send $1 to one of your friends and $1 to another one of your friends, the history doesn't become unconnected again, the history stays connected.\nSo each of them has to check the history of both Sjors' coin and my coin.\nAnother way of saying this would be, if you have a Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain, you can't actually go back and figure out exactly inside of which Bitcoin block that Bitcoin originated, because the history is connected.\nAnd so because of that, what you end up with is, you might have to download a significant chunk of everybody's history instead of these paths that in the ideal case, short suspension.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:41:18\n\nYou're saying that the spaghetti strain gets longer and longer and you get more and more spaghetti strains as money's being combined.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:41:25\n\nYeah.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:41:25\n\nYou end up with a ton of spaghetti which is cool for an Italian project.\nI think that's all we got right?\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:41:31\n\nThat's right.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:41:32\n\nI want to ask you guys.\nWhy do we want this on Bitcoin? Because it sounds like...\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:41:37\n\nWe don't have a choice.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:41:38\n\n..it's just a whole bunch of data.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:41:40\n\nWell, it's mostly data that exists outside of Bitcoin that we don't care about.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:41:44\n\nIt still requires transactions on the blockchain, at least.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:41:47\n\nYeah, but who can stop that?\nBecause they look like regular transactions, so it doesn't matter what we want.\nWe can't stop it.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:41:54\n\nLet's say if you had the option to very easily add native tokens to Bitcoin, where you could issue assets and you could just use them on the Bitcoin blockchain.\nIf you did something like that, in terms of blockchain usage, it would be very similar.\nBecause with RGB, you have kind of the same thing, where every time you move a token, you do need to create a Bitcoin transaction.\nBut that Bitcoin transaction doesn't really have anything to do with Bitcoin, other than that it wants to be connected to its proof-of-work.\nSo would we want that?\nWould we want people to just issue any token they want just natively on Bitcoin?\nAnd then most people would kind of say \"No\".\nSo RGB forces the issue basically and says \"You can just do it!\", if you do it like this.\nSo do we want that?\nDo we not want that?\nI don't think it's going to be terrible.\nI think it's going to be okay.\nAnd I don't think there's going to be some kind of token that is so popular that it will pull away most of the proof-of-work or something along those lines.\nThat would be kind of the doomsday scenario.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:42:55\n\nThe risk there is, we talked about that in other episodes about Sidechains as well.\nIf the entire world supply of gold is expressed as an RGB token, that's a problem.\nBecause the market cap of gold is 10 times that of Bitcoin at the moment.\nWhich means that somebody who wants to steal gold through a double-spend attack, might want to do that.\nAnd from a Bitcoin point of view, that attack would look uneconomical, but from a gold point of view, it would look economical.\nAnd therefore, it just messes with the incentive structure that we have.\nBut we're not there yet, and I'm not really worried about it.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:43:29\n\nActually, I think the opposite problem is more likely.\nWhere the Bitcoin fees are going to go up.\nAnd at that point, if you want to use USD Tether, you have to pay the Bitcoin fees to use your USD Tether.\nAnd then you have to ask, well, if I can use my USD Tether on any chain, why would I use it on the expensive Bitcoin blockchain?\nI think that kind of becomes the bottleneck for RGB, where any token you want to move on RGB, at least without using Lightning and as I pointed out earlier, you will have to use the base layer every now and then, will have to pay as high of a fee as a Bitcoin transaction and whether or not that's going to be economical, I don't know.\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:44:10\n\nExactly, and if you're doing client-side validation anyway, maybe you just want to use a database, but...\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:44:18\n\nPerhaps, yeah.\nThe Spacechains, it wasn't called Spacechains back then, but the episode we did on the perpetual one-way peg and Blind Merged Mining, it is actually a very similar system.\nSo you could compare the two, but the difference is that you are less connected to the proof-of-work.\nEvery RGB transaction you make, you need to make a Bitcoin transaction.\nYou now have one Bitcoin transaction that represents an entire block of tokens, basically.\nSo that would at least make it cheaper to do tokens, but at the same time, you're also less secure because you don't have the full proof-of-work.\nIt's not directly connected, It's a little bit more indirect.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:45:04\n\nWait, wait, Sjors.\nI have one last question.\nDid you want to get into the Proofmarshal thing or are we going to leave that for a different episode?\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:45:13\n\nExactly, we have another can of worms that's called Proofmarshal.\nWe are not going to open that.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:45:17\n\nOkay, do you want to end on a positive note?\n\nSjors Provoost: 00:45:19\n\nI want to end by saying thank you everybody for listening to The Van Wirdum Sjorsnado.\n\nAaron van Wirdum: 00:45:24\n\nThere you go.\n\nRuben Somsen: 00:45:25\n\nThere you go.\n\n",

    "summary": "In an engaging episode of The Van Wirdum Sjorsnado, hosts Aaron van Wirdum and Sjors Provoost, along with guest Ruben Somsen, embark on a deep dive into the world of NFTs, focusing on the complexities and implications of integrating such digital assets within blockchain technology. Their conversation offers a rich exploration of the historical challenges posed by embedding non-transactional data within Bitcoin's blockchain, highlighting innovative solutions to mitigate these issues and exploring the future of digital asset transactions.\n\nThe discussion begins with a lighthearted look at the practice of selling tweets, segueing into a more serious examination of how the Bitcoin blockchain was historically misused for embedding arbitrary data. This misuse led to significant bloat and inefficiencies within the system, prompting the development of the `OP_RETURN` opcode as a compromise solution. By allowing data to be marked explicitly as unspendable, `OP_RETURN` helped streamline blockchain operations, reducing the memory footprint required to maintain the network while accommodating the community's creative uses of the technology.\n\nFurther elaborating on the technical aspects of blockchain optimization, the episode delves into the use of `OP_RETURN` transactions. These transactions, limited in data capacity, offer a way to embed information without overburdening the blockchain's UTXO set. The speakers discuss how this approach has facilitated novel applications like the Rare Pepe trading card system, which leverages hashes instead of storing actual images on the blockchain. This method underscores a foundational principle of the NFT craze: creating and transferring ownership of digital items through blockchain technology, where the items themselves are not stored on-chain but represented by hashes.\n\nThe conversation then transitions to the concept of colored coins and the RGB System, illuminating how these innovations enable the representation of real-world assets on the blockchain. Colored coins, as tokens that signify ownership of assets ranging from digital collectibles to physical goods, showcase the versatility of blockchain technology in bridging the gap between digital and tangible worlds. The introduction of the RGB protocol, in particular, marks a significant advancement in tokenization processes, allowing for more efficient and private transactions by leveraging client-side validation and cryptographic methods akin to those found in Taproot.\n\nAs the dialogue progresses, the speakers explore the operational nuances and potential applications of the RGB protocol, emphasizing the importance of off-chain data management and personal data custody. They highlight how RGB enables complex financial transactions atop the Bitcoin blockchain, supported by a robust infrastructure that ensures seamless user experiences. This discussion not only sheds light on the technical intricacies of RGB but also reflects on the broader implications for the sustainability and adaptability of blockchain ecosystems.\n\nIn concluding, the podcast delves into the integration of RGB Protocol transactions with Bitcoin transactions through the Lightning Network, discussing both the opportunities and challenges presented by this innovative approach. The speakers examine the feasibility of conducting atomic swaps and managing fungible tokens within the Lightning Network, addressing technical hurdles and the broader economic implications for miners and the ecosystem at large.\n\nThrough their comprehensive analysis, Sjors Provoost, Aaron van Wirdum, and Ruben Somsen offer invaluable insights into the evolving landscape of blockchain technology and digital asset transactions. Their discussion highlights the ongoing efforts to optimize blockchain efficiency, ensure transactional privacy, and expand the utility of Bitcoin beyond a mere currency to a foundational platform supporting a diverse range of digital assets."
