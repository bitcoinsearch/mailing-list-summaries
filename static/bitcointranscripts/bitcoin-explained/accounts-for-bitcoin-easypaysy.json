exchange if you're sending them money they know everything about you and they like that right?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:01:26\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"It's so convenient, it's so easy, nothing to complain about here.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:01:30\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Absolutely.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:01:31\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So that was our episode.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:01:33\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Thank you for listening.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:01:34\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Okay, actually, I think everyone will know reusing addresses is a horrible idea.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:01:39\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Absolutely.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:01:39\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"You're giving away all your privacy.\\nI guess that's the main problem, right?\\nYou're just giving away your privacy.\\nI guess In the long run, there's maybe some sort of quantum risk, but we mostly care about privacy.\\nYou're giving away your own privacy, and also you're compromising the privacy of everyone you're interacting with.\\nBecause if you give away your privacy, that means everyone who's paying you, blockchain analysts can figure out that they're paying you and the other way around if you're paying people.\\nSo it's compromising everyone's privacy.\\nWhile it's very convenient, it's something we shouldn't be doing, is it, Sjors?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:02:17\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Exactly.\\nThat's why most wallets have a button called get new address and some good wallets will actually automatically make a new address whenever you even click on receive.\\nSome wallets don't.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:02:30\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"All right, so that works.\\nWe need to generate a new address for each payment we receive.\\nHowever, Sjors, this is a little bit inconvenient as well, isn't it?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:02:38\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"It can be.\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"Why accounts would be useful intro to Easypaysy\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:02:39\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So, here's the solution.\\nWe need an account system for Bitcoin.\\nOr at least, it's possible to create an account system on Bitcoin and it could be useful.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:02:49\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I think the the word account has some negative connotations, but it'd be nice if you knew one thing about the other party and then you can keep sending the money while automatically using a new address.\\nI think that's what we want.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:03:05\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So, Jose Femenias Canuelo, that's probably a severe mispronunciation of his name, but Spanish developer Jose Femenias Canuelo, he also believes so.\\nHe believes Bitcoin would benefit from an account system.\\nIt's called Easypaysy, which is short for Easy Payment System, I think.\\nEasypaysy, and that's what we're going to discuss today.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:03:33\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"All right.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:03:33\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"It's pretty clever and we'll get to possible downsides later, but let's first just explain how it works.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:03:41\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"How does it work?\\nBecause this time you're going to explain how this thing works.\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"what is Easypaysy?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:03:44\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I'm going to do most of the explaining this time.\\nAll right, so to generate an account, one of the clever things about this proposal is that it uses nothing outside of the Bitcoin blockchain itself, necessarily.\\nThere's options to that, but we can do it all without any outside of blockchain thing.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:04:06\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"By \\\"thing\\\" you don't mean wallets, but you mean there's no communication protocol, you don't have to run a server to communicate with the other person?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:04:14\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Exactly, we generate the account on the Bitcoin blockchain itself, and people can find the account on the Bitcoin blockchain itself.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:04:22\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Okay, so how do I generate an account?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:04:24\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"An account is basically a transaction.\\nThat's in this proposal what an account is.\\nAnd this transaction consists of one input, so one address where coins are sent from, but this one input is a multi-sig input, so it has two public keys.\\nIt also has one output, which is one `OP_RETURN` output.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:04:52\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So you're sending some money from a multisig address that you control yourself to...\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:04:59\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"No input.\\nYou're basically sending no money but you do need to pay a fee.\\nThat's the only money that's involved in this transaction.\\nYou're not actually spending anything to anyone, but you need a little bit of funds to have it confirmed.\\nThe input does need to send some money, which is the fee, and then the output receives nothing.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:05:17\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"And so the reason why we need a 2 of 2 multisig is...\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:05:22\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"There's two public keys in there.\\nThese are basically your public keys at this point.\\nWhen you're making this transaction, you're announcing to the world, these are my two public keys.\\nOne public key is your identity public key or...\\nOne of them is for communication anyways.\\nI forget, there's a term for it, which I'm, which is slipping my mind right now, but one of them is for communication.\\nIf you want to send me some kind of message, you use this public key, which I think is the first of the two - it's just an order.\\nThe first one is for communication, and then the second one is for value.\\nI think the main reason there's two is that one is even more important than the other.\\nIf you lose your communication key, that's a problem, but at least you're not losing money.\\nIf you lose the value key, you're actually losing money.\\nWhat you can do is you can put the value key in cold storage in a safe, somewhere secure while you can still talk with people, communicate with people.\\nThat way even if your computer is compromised and only your communication is compromised you still keep your funds.\\nThat's why there's two basically.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:06:35\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"It might be worth reminding the listener that so what you're doing here is you're funding your own or like putting a trivial amount in your own multi-sig address and then immediately spending from that multi-sig address and the reason you have to do the latter is because you reveal the keys when you're spending not when you're receiving.\\nSo in order for the rest of the world to see what your keys are you have to spend from it.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:06:58\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"That's a good addition indeed when you're spending to...\\nWell anyway no need to repeat you're right.\\nOkay so\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:07:05\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Then the `OP_RETURN` message that's in the outputs of this transaction can communicate any other piece of information to the world.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:07:12\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"You can basically communicate text in this output.\\nThe text we're communicating here is a JSON message, and it includes the instructions for how to pay to this account.\\nThat's the main thing it includes.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:07:26\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I doubt it's actually JSON.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:07:29\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I thought it was JSON.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:07:30\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"It's some sort of serialized format, probably, that you can convert to JSON.\\nBecause otherwise it would be very inefficient.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:07:37\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"What Jose told me is it's a small JSON document.\\nYou think that's probably a simplification?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:07:44\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Well I don't know I didn't read it in that level of detail.\\nThere's only 80 bytes available in `OP_RETURN`.\\nYou could use those 80 bytes to write ASCII characters, with an opening bracket and colons and all this stuff.\\nBut you can also agree on a serialization format that could put way more information in a smaller space.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:08:03\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"But you don't need to communicate a lot of data, you just need to tell people which kinds of transactions you're accepting on this account.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:08:11\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sure, you can do it inefficient if there's not much data, but if you want more data you can do it more efficiently.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:08:16\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Okay, fair enough.\\nAnyway, so there's three ways of receiving funds on these accounts.\\nThe first way is not recommended.\\nIt's to receive payments on your value publicly.\\nSo now we're back to reusing addresses.\\nWe don't actually want that, but it's an option.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:08:35\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"It's even worse than that, I guess, because you're announcing, \\\"hey, this is where the money is going\\\" to the whole world.\\nAnd then it's reusing addresses with everyone that you receive money from, plus everyone you're not even receiving money from.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:08:49\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"It's bad.\\nIt's in there because it's just an option for people to use.\\nYou can choose not to use it, but if we're making this protocol, that was Jose's reasoning, we might as well include it for people who do want to use it.\\nIt's a little bit like donation addresses.\\nSome people do use a donation address, which is just one address they post on a website somewhere, and anyone can pay to this address.\\nWhile it's not ideal, it's an option for people that insist on compromising their privacy.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:09:21\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Okay, what's the other option?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:09:23\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Okay, so the one I just described, that's type zero.\\nAnd then type one is the next option, which uses the communication key basically to request an address.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:09:43\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Okay, how do you request an address?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:09:44\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"There's different ways of doing it.\\nYou can do it through mail.\\nThis is not specified in the protocol.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:09:50\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Okay, so this is where you do need some back and forth communication.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:09:52\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes, this one is interactive.\\nYou can request it through email or maybe signal or maybe some other, maybe snail mail, however you want.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:10:02\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"But this to me sounds like what we're already doing, where giving people unique addresses.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:10:06\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"This is pretty similar to that indeed.\\nThis is just one of the options in the account system.\\nIt's not all groundbreaking.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:10:13\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Tell me about this groundbreaking third option, before I fall asleep.\\nNo, just kidding.\\nKeep going.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:10:19\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"One of the interesting things here, I would argue, is that you're still signing it with your communication key to sort of prove that it's you who's requesting the payment, which can come in handy later on.\\nThat was type one.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Then type two, this closely resembles stealth addresses.\\nThis is where it gets a little bit more complicated.\\nThis is where the sender of the transaction takes the recipients, so the account holders value key, and the sender himself generates a public key and a private key.\\nHe uses his key pair in combination with the recipients, the account holders public key to generate a new key pair.\\nAnd then he sends the funds to the public key or to the address that corresponds to this newly generated key pair.\\nSo the money is going there.\\nIn this transaction, he also includes another `OP_RETURN` in which the public key is included.\\nThe public key he generated himself and with this public key, the account holder can use this public key to regenerate the new key pair and thereby he can spend the funds.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"The way this works, if you're an account holder, is you need to know that this transaction happened.\\nThere's two ways of figuring that out.\\nOne of them is that the sender just tells you like, \\\"hey, I sent you some money, look at that transaction and you can use it with the information in `OP_RETURN` to generate a private key which you can use to spend the money\\\".\\nOr the account holder just needs to scan the blockchain to see if there are any transactions with an `OP_RETURN` in there and if there is see if there's information in there that he can use to generate this new key pair that actually matches and that actually lets him spend the coins.\\nIn which case he just finds money on the blockchain basically so he knows he's been paid.\\nThis is a little bit of a hassle of course, because it requires scanning of the blockchain and all of that.\\nIt's relatively private, because even though the value key was revealed in his account, this new money isn't sent to anything that anyone can link to the account by just looking at the blockchain.\\nIt's sent to a completely new address, which even the recipients, the account holder, didn't know at first and had to figure out.\\nTherefore, it does offer nice privacy features.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:12:57\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I'd say that's quite nice.\\nThe privacy gotcha there that I would think about is that when you as the recipient you first publish you know your identifier, your account...\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:13:08\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Let's first explain that and then you get to the privacy gotcha.\\nLike what the identifier is?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:13:16\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Oh what the identifier is, yeah sure you can do that.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:13:19\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So how do people find your account?\\nAs mentioned, it's just a transaction.\\nIt's a Bitcoin transaction that's going to be included in the blockchain.\\nSo the place where it is included in the blockchain, that is the identifier.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:13:32\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"For example, the block height plus the place in the block.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:13:35\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"That's exactly what it is.\\nNot for example, that's exactly what it is.\\nSo the block height is, I don't know, 578331.\\nI'm just making something up.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:13:47\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"You're one of those old schoolers that still remembers blocks in the 500,000 range.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:13:52\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"No, I think that's what I used in my article when I wrote this.\\nThat's why it's still sort of stuck in my head.\\nI didn't use this exact number, but somewhere in the 500k range, I think.\\nAnd then it's like the 738th in the blockchain and then the actual account identifier is, if I'm recalling correctly, it starts with the actual blockchain.\\nIf it's Bitcoin, it's like BTC at 500, whatever number I just used in the 500k range, dot and then 700, whichever one I just used, and then I think there's a slash and there's a checksum.\\nThen you have this identifier, which is based on the place in the blockchain.\\nThere are ways where you can revert.\\nThat's not the right word.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:14:45\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I think what you were going to say is it's going to convert to some nice mnemonic style.\\nSo a couple of words like \\\"rabbit, big, fish\\\".\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:14:54\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Exactly.\\nRight now I was unable to remember the exact numbers I used, but if I would have used a mnemonic in the first place, \\\"Rabbit, fish\\\", I already forgot.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:15:03\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah, \\\"rabbit, big, fish\\\".\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:15:04\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Whatever it was.\\nThat's much easier to remember.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:15:07\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"That makes sense.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:15:08\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Then you can remember it and you can tell people and you don't forget.\\nIt's much easier to remember.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:15:13\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"And you can go on TV and say, remember \\\"rabbit, big, fish\\\".\\nThen people can send money to \\\"rabbit, big, fish\\\".\\nAnd maybe that's slightly easier than giving them an address, though I'm a little skeptical whether that short name is such a big deal.\\nBut this is kind of where we get the privacy gotcha and also the stealth address part.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:15:31\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Let's hear it.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:15:32\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"The first time you're using this as a recipient, you're going to create an account, you're going to put a transaction on the blockchain.\\nIf then later on you receive coins, we're going to assume you use this third methodology, the nice privacy thing, it's going to arrive on different addresses.\\nSo that's very nice.\\nBut, if you're stupid, or if your wallet is stupid, it's going to combine coins that, you know, are related to that first transaction.\\nThe first transaction itself is not spendable because it's an `OP_RETURN`, but maybe it comes from another coin.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:16:04\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sure.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:16:05\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"And now you start combining coins and somebody can link your identity to everything you received.\\nSo you still need to be very wary of this cluster analysis risk.\\nA new wallet could avoid that and warn you about it.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:16:17\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"No, that's true.\\nYou have coins in your wallet which you're going to use to pay the fee.\\nYou probably have more in your wallet than just the fees, so you have change and it's then sort of linked to your account.\\nAnd then after which the coins can be linked to even the coins you received privately.\\nAnd that's something to be aware of, sure.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:16:40\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So I think it's this initial step where you have to announce something on the blockchain that creates this liability almost.\\nNow for some parties that's actually kind of a feature or at least they can manage it.\\nIf you're an exchange, you know what you're doing, you're not gonna make those privacy mistakes.\\nAnd one of the cool things is that you can, you can, you know, add a DNS record is one of the suggestions so that people can verify that, hey, this DNS record matches this big fish thing.\\nAnd that's a nice way to double check.\\nI could imagine hardware wallets could also embed some of these well-known codes so that if you're sending to Kraken or whatever, your hardware wallet could say, oh yeah that's actually an address that belongs to that exchange, at least the last time we we updated the firmware to know these accounts.\\nIt's kind of nice against clipboard attacks and that sort of stuff.\\nBut that's for these schemes in general.\\nI don't think you need to have this announcement into blockchain specifically.\\nSo if you go to stealth addresses, which I believe is BIP47, mechanism there was slightly different, though I might remember it incorrectly.\\nBut the idea there is that you generate a payment code, which is longer, but it's not something you have to put on the blockchain.\\nAnd so you can give that code to somebody else, and that's your identity, but that identity is not tied to anything in the blockchain.\\nAnd then you do the same magic trick with somebody takes their own key and adds it and does a bunch of math and then sends it to an address.\\nAnd then I think there is an announcement on the blockchain, but it's done by the sender.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:18:15\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"It's always done by the sender.\\nAt least the payment is...\\nOh, there's a separate announcement from the payment?\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"Explaining Stealth Address Identities\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:18:21\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So in the scheme we just talked about in Easypaysy, it's the recipient who has to announce their identity on the blockchain, essentially once.\\nBut then when you want to send to them, there's some back and forth.\\nBut here in the stealth addresses scheme, it is the sender that needs to make an announcement on the blockchain saying, to a standard address, hey, so they get a payment code and they send one transaction to a standardized address, which is always the same thing, as a handshake.\\nAnd then using the handshake, that's how you come up with the unique addresses that you're actually going to use.\\nSo the recipient will watch the handshake address and every time it sees a transaction on the handshake address it then knows what other addresses it should be watching.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:19:07\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Okay so that does require more blockchain transactions then.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:19:12\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I don't know about the number of blockchain transactions, maybe a little bit, but the nice thing is that it's the senders that are sort of sacrificing their privacy, but only really to the recipient and they're doing that anyway, because they're paying the recipient, rather than the recipient revealing it, you know, lowering its privacy.\\nBut I don't think it's a huge deal and all of these schemes you can choose to just do more off-chain.\\nYou can just have an identifier that you send via email and yeah it's not as short, that's a downside, but it's just a public key in that case and you can do fun things with it.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:19:48\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"You want to get into the benefits of this system\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"Debating Use Cases for Easypaysy\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:19:51\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"We did some benefits and some downsides.\\nI would like to remind the listeners of a chicken-egg problem that was brought up by the infamous ZmnSCPxj.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:20:04\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Z-Man.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:20:05\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Z-Man, or as the Canadians say, Zetman.\\nIf you're a new Bitcoin user and you want to use this system, you don't have coins to send anywhere.\\nSo that's a problem, but there might be ways around it, especially if you're buying coins from an exchange, maybe they can help you set it up.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:20:23\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I want to get into more benefits, Sjors.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:20:25\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Okay.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:20:26\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I think we skipped over the benefits a little bit.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:20:28\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I mentioned a few, but give me more.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:20:30\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Recurring payments.\\nDid we mention that one?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:20:32\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"No, we haven't mentioned that, that's a good one.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:20:34\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So recurring payments, so you want to pay rent every month, so your landlord would have to generate a new address every month and, wait, why is this a problem?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:20:46\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"You could say it's annoying for the landlord to have to send you an email with an address every month.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:20:51\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Exactly.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:20:52\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"And then it's nice if you can generate, if you can predict these addresses yourself.\\nBut I would immediately say there's a downside to that, because if, let's say my landlord has this magic box that he receives his Bitcoin on and then his magic box breaks but he can't give you a phone call to say \\\"hey yo don't send me any more Bitcoins\\\" then your rent just goes into the ether.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:21:18\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"He can call you, right?\\nHe knows where you live.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:21:22\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"He does know where you live.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:21:24\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"He probably does.\\nHe can ring the bell.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:21:25\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"But maybe the postal service is down because of some election issue.\\nSo, you know, it can be tricky.\\nAnd more generally, let's say you are a very sophisticated recipient of these Bitcoins, maybe you are a landlord and initially you just have a you know you have one tenant that pays rent that way and you just use your little hardware wallet and you generate these addresses that way.\\nAll is good and well then you have lots of customers and you have a lot of money.\\nMaybe you want to set up a multi-sig cold storage.\\nOh but now you have to

{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sure but here's the thing I think your argument doesn't hold up because I think the idea is that if you're the landlord, you can request payment each month.\\nYou just send a message, hey, pay me.\\nAnd then your wallets can be programmed to allow this once a month for up to whatever your pay is.\\nThat way your wallet doesn't need to know all of the addresses

request payments from you.\\nWhether that's push-based or pull-based, maybe your wallet is running and it's pulling the landlord's server every day to say, \\\"hey do you have an invoice for me, do

already solved.\\nI think projects like BTCPay Server have made it ridiculously easy for at least for shops to just never use the same address.\\nExchanges should just never use the same address, otherwise they're just completely incompetent.\\nOne thing that might be worth noting is there's a development in Lightning by Rusty, who's proposed a system where normally with Lightning you scan an invoice, that's a QR code somewhere, and you pay it.\\nThat's it.\\nBut this proposal would basically have a QR code where if you scan it, you ping the node, then you get an invoice and you pay it.\\nThat might sound trivial, but it means that you can stick a QR code on an orange in the supermarket and like multiple people can buy an orange basically and get a unique invoice for it.\\nAnd you can adjust the price real time rather than having everything fixed.\\nBecause if you put an actual Lightning invoice on an orange, then after a week the price might be completely wrong.\\nSo in this case your orange is more like an identifier that says, hey go to this lightning node and ask me about the price of the orange.\\nAnd that sort of solves a lot of these problems too.\\nSo you can have fixed identities.\\nThe orange could have an identity or it's probably the supermarket that sells the orange.\\nAnd So you get sort of the same thing.\\nYou can also do recurring payments and all these cool things.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron: 00:30:37\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"With an orange?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors: 00:30:38\"},

{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"No, but I'm not saying there's any other specific way to go.\\nMy guess is because there's so many different ways to go and not a lot of people are enthusiastic about building it, it's gonna be in a bike shedding-ish state for many more years.\\nSo my hope is that on Lightning we'll get all this sorted out more quickly and then maybe whatever happens on Lightning can inspire on chain.\\nOr for that matter maybe you just run your Lightning Node software and let it hand out some on-chain addresses when needed.\\nSo Lightning might be the default, but for big payments you do use on-chain, but you use all the Lightning protocol stuff, including the encryption and the routing and the 24-7 server to take care of generating on-chain addresses and

    "body": "## Intro\n\nAaron: 00:01:10\n\nSjors how do you like reusing addresses?\n\nSjors: 00:01:13\n\nI love reusing addresses, it's amazing.\n\nAaron: 00:01:16\n\nIt's so convenient isn't it\n\nSjors: 00:01:18\n\nIt just makes you feel like you know your exchange if you're sending them money they know everything about you and they like that right?\n\nAaron: 00:01:26\n\nIt's so convenient, it's so easy, nothing to complain about here.\n\nSjors: 00:01:30\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nAaron: 00:01:31\n\nSo that was our episode.\n\nSjors: 00:01:33\n\nThank you for listening.\n\nAaron: 00:01:34\n\nOkay, actually, I think everyone will know reusing addresses is a horrible idea.\n\nSjors: 00:01:39\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nAaron: 00:01:39\n\nYou're giving away all your privacy.\nI guess that's the main problem, right?\nYou're just giving away your privacy.\nI guess In the long run, there's maybe some sort of quantum risk, but we mostly care about privacy.\nYou're giving away your own privacy, and also you're compromising the privacy of everyone you're interacting with.\nBecause if you give away your privacy, that means everyone who's paying you, blockchain analysts can figure out that they're paying you and the other way around if you're paying people.\nSo it's compromising everyone's privacy.\nWhile it's very convenient, it's something we shouldn't be doing, is it, Sjors?\n\nSjors: 00:02:17\n\nExactly.\nThat's why most wallets have a button called get new address and some good wallets will actually automatically make a new address whenever you even click on receive.\nSome wallets don't.\n\nAaron: 00:02:30\n\nAll right, so that works.\nWe need to generate a new address for each payment we receive.\nHowever, Sjors, this is a little bit inconvenient as well, isn't it?\n\nSjors: 00:02:38\n\nIt can be.\n\n## Why accounts would be useful intro to Easypaysy\n\nAaron: 00:02:39\n\nSo, here's the solution.\nWe need an account system for Bitcoin.\nOr at least, it's possible to create an account system on Bitcoin and it could be useful.\n\nSjors: 00:02:49\n\nI think the the word account has some negative connotations, but it'd be nice if you knew one thing about the other party and then you can keep sending the money while automatically using a new address.\nI think that's what we want.\n\nAaron: 00:03:05\n\nSo, Jose Femenias Canuelo, that's probably a severe mispronunciation of his name, but Spanish developer Jose Femenias Canuelo, he also believes so.\nHe believes Bitcoin would benefit from an account system.\nIt's called Easypaysy, which is short for Easy Payment System, I think.\nEasypaysy, and that's what we're going to discuss today.\n\nSjors: 00:03:33\n\nAll right.\n\nAaron: 00:03:33\n\nIt's pretty clever and we'll get to possible downsides later, but let's first just explain how it works.\n\nSjors: 00:03:41\n\nHow does it work?\nBecause this time you're going to explain how this thing works.\n\n## what is Easypaysy?\n\nAaron: 00:03:44\n\nI'm going to do most of the explaining this time.\nAll right, so to generate an account, one of the clever things about this proposal is that it uses nothing outside of the Bitcoin blockchain itself, necessarily.\nThere's options to that, but we can do it all without any outside of blockchain thing.\n\nSjors: 00:04:06\n\nBy \"thing\" you don't mean wallets, but you mean there's no communication protocol, you don't have to run a server to communicate with the other person?\n\nAaron: 00:04:14\n\nExactly, we generate the account on the Bitcoin blockchain itself, and people can find the account on the Bitcoin blockchain itself.\n\nSjors: 00:04:22\n\nOkay, so how do I generate an account?\n\nAaron: 00:04:24\n\nAn account is basically a transaction.\nThat's in this proposal what an account is.\nAnd this transaction consists of one input, so one address where coins are sent from, but this one input is a multi-sig input, so it has two public keys.\nIt also has one output, which is one `OP_RETURN` output.\n\nSjors: 00:04:52\n\nSo you're sending some money from a multisig address that you control yourself to...\n\nAaron: 00:04:59\n\nNo input.\nYou're basically sending no money but you do need to pay a fee.\nThat's the only money that's involved in this transaction.\nYou're not actually spending anything to anyone, but you need a little bit of funds to have it confirmed.\nThe input does need to send some money, which is the fee, and then the output receives nothing.\n\nSjors: 00:05:17\n\nAnd so the reason why we need a 2 of 2 multisig is...\n\nAaron: 00:05:22\n\nThere's two public keys in there.\nThese are basically your public keys at this point.\nWhen you're making this transaction, you're announcing to the world, these are my two public keys.\nOne public key is your identity public key or...\nOne of them is for communication anyways.\nI forget, there's a term for it, which I'm, which is slipping my mind right now, but one of them is for communication.\nIf you want to send me some kind of message, you use this public key, which I think is the first of the two - it's just an order.\nThe first one is for communication, and then the second one is for value.\nI think the main reason there's two is that one is even more important than the other.\nIf you lose your communication key, that's a problem, but at least you're not losing money.\nIf you lose the value key, you're actually losing money.\nWhat you can do is you can put the value key in cold storage in a safe, somewhere secure while you can still talk with people, communicate with people.\nThat way even if your computer is compromised and only your communication is compromised you still keep your funds.\nThat's why there's two basically.\n\nSjors: 00:06:35\n\nIt might be worth reminding the listener that so what you're doing here is you're funding your own or like putting a trivial amount in your own multi-sig address and then immediately spending from that multi-sig address and the reason you have to do the latter is because you reveal the keys when you're spending not when you're receiving.\nSo in order for the rest of the world to see what your keys are you have to spend from it.\n\nAaron: 00:06:58\n\nThat's a good addition indeed when you're spending to...\nWell anyway no need to repeat you're right.\nOkay so\n\nSjors: 00:07:05\n\nThen the `OP_RETURN` message that's in the outputs of this transaction can communicate any other piece of information to the world.\n\nAaron: 00:07:12\n\nYou can basically communicate text in this output.\nThe text we're communicating here is a JSON message, and it includes the instructions for how to pay to this account.\nThat's the main thing it includes.\n\nSjors: 00:07:26\n\nI doubt it's actually JSON.\n\nAaron: 00:07:29\n\nI thought it was JSON.\n\nSjors: 00:07:30\n\nIt's some sort of serialized format, probably, that you can convert to JSON.\nBecause otherwise it would be very inefficient.\n\nAaron: 00:07:37\n\nWhat Jose told me is it's a small JSON document.\nYou think that's probably a simplification?\n\nSjors: 00:07:44\n\nWell I don't know I didn't read it in that level of detail.\nThere's only 80 bytes available in `OP_RETURN`.\nYou could use those 80 bytes to write ASCII characters, with an opening bracket and colons and all this stuff.\nBut you can also agree on a serialization format that could put way more information in a smaller space.\n\nAaron: 00:08:03\n\nBut you don't need to communicate a lot of data, you just need to tell people which kinds of transactions you're accepting on this account.\n\nSjors: 00:08:11\n\nSure, you can do it inefficient if there's not much data, but if you want more data you can do it more efficiently.\n\nAaron: 00:08:16\n\nOkay, fair enough.\nAnyway, so there's three ways of receiving funds on these accounts.\nThe first way is not recommended.\nIt's to receive payments on your value publicly.\nSo now we're back to reusing addresses.\nWe don't actually want that, but it's an option.\n\nSjors: 00:08:35\n\nIt's even worse than that, I guess, because you're announcing, \"hey, this is where the money is going\" to the whole world.\nAnd then it's reusing addresses with everyone that you receive money from, plus everyone you're not even receiving money from.\n\nAaron: 00:08:49\n\nIt's bad.\nIt's in there because it's just an option for people to use.\nYou can choose not to use it, but if we're making this protocol, that was Jose's reasoning, we might as well include it for people who do want to use it.\nIt's a little bit like donation addresses.\nSome people do use a donation address, which is just one address they post on a website somewhere, and anyone can pay to this address.\nWhile it's not ideal, it's an option for people that insist on compromising their privacy.\n\nSjors: 00:09:21\n\nOkay, what's the other option?\n\nAaron: 00:09:23\n\nOkay, so the one I just described, that's type zero.\nAnd then type one is the next option, which uses the communication key basically to request an address.\n\nSjors: 00:09:43\n\nOkay, how do you request an address?\n\nAaron: 00:09:44\n\nThere's different ways of doing it.\nYou can do it through mail.\nThis is not specified in the protocol.\n\nSjors: 00:09:50\n\nOkay, so this is where you do need some back and forth communication.\n\nAaron: 00:09:52\n\nYes, this one is interactive.\nYou can request it through email or maybe signal or maybe some other, maybe snail mail, however you want.\n\nSjors: 00:10:02\n\nBut this to me sounds like what we're already doing, where giving people unique addresses.\n\nAaron: 00:10:06\n\nThis is pretty similar to that indeed.\nThis is just one of the options in the account system.\nIt's not all groundbreaking.\n\nSjors: 00:10:13\n\nTell me about this groundbreaking third option, before I fall asleep.\nNo, just kidding.\nKeep going.\n\nAaron: 00:10:19\n\nOne of the interesting things here, I would argue, is that you're still signing it with your communication key to sort of prove that it's you who's requesting the payment, which can come in handy later on.\nThat was type one.\n\nThen type two, this closely resembles stealth addresses.\nThis is where it gets a little bit more complicated.\nThis is where the sender of the transaction takes the recipients, so the account holders value key, and the sender himself generates a public key and a private key.\nHe uses his key pair in combination with the recipients, the account holders public key to generate a new key pair.\nAnd then he sends the funds to the public key or to the address that corresponds to this newly generated key pair.\nSo the money is going there.\nIn this transaction, he also includes another `OP_RETURN` in which the public key is included.\nThe public key he generated himself and with this public key, the account holder can use this public key to regenerate the new key pair and thereby he can spend the funds.\n\n\nThe way this works, if you're an account holder, is you need to know that this transaction happened.\nThere's two ways of figuring that out.\nOne of them is that the sender just tells you like, \"hey, I sent you some money, look at that transaction and you can use it with the information in `OP_RETURN` to generate a private key which you can use to spend the money\".\nOr the account holder just needs to scan the blockchain to see if there are any transactions with an `OP_RETURN` in there and if there is see if there's information in there that he can use to generate this new key pair that actually matches and that actually lets him spend the coins.\nIn which case he just finds money on the blockchain basically so he knows he's been paid.\nThis is a little bit of a hassle of course, because it requires scanning of the blockchain and all of that.\nIt's relatively private, because even though the value key was revealed in his account, this new money isn't sent to anything that anyone can link to the account by just looking at the blockchain.\nIt's sent to a completely new address, which even the recipients, the account holder, didn't know at first and had to figure out.\nTherefore, it does offer nice privacy features.\n\nSjors: 00:12:57\n\nI'd say that's quite nice.\nThe privacy gotcha there that I would think about is that when you as the recipient you first publish you know your identifier, your account...\n\nAaron: 00:13:08\n\nLet's first explain that and then you get to the privacy gotcha.\nLike what the identifier is?\n\nSjors: 00:13:16\n\nOh what the identifier is, yeah sure you can do that.\n\nAaron: 00:13:19\n\nSo how do people find your account?\nAs mentioned, it's just a transaction.\nIt's a Bitcoin transaction that's going to be included in the blockchain.\nSo the place where it is included in the blockchain, that is the identifier.\n\nSjors: 00:13:32\n\nFor example, the block height plus the place in the block.\n\nAaron: 00:13:35\n\nThat's exactly what it is.\nNot for example, that's exactly what it is.\nSo the block height is, I don't know, 578331.\nI'm just making something up.\n\nSjors: 00:13:47\n\nYou're one of those old schoolers that still remembers blocks in the 500,000 range.\n\nAaron: 00:13:52\n\nNo, I think that's what I used in my article when I wrote this.\nThat's why it's still sort of stuck in my head.\nI didn't use this exact number, but somewhere in the 500k range, I think.\nAnd then it's like the 738th in the blockchain and then the actual account identifier is, if I'm recalling correctly, it starts with the actual blockchain.\nIf it's Bitcoin, it's like BTC at 500, whatever number I just used in the 500k range, dot and then 700, whichever one I just used, and then I think there's a slash and there's a checksum.\nThen you have this identifier, which is based on the place in the blockchain.\nThere are ways where you can revert.\nThat's not the right word.\n\nSjors: 00:14:45\n\nI think what you were going to say is it's going to convert to some nice mnemonic style.\nSo a couple of words like \"rabbit, big, fish\".\n\nAaron: 00:14:54\n\nExactly.\nRight now I was unable to remember the exact numbers I used, but if I would have used a mnemonic in the first place, \"Rabbit, fish\", I already forgot.\n\nSjors: 00:15:03\n\nYeah, \"rabbit, big, fish\".\n\nAaron: 00:15:04\n\nWhatever it was.\nThat's much easier to remember.\n\nSjors: 00:15:07\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nAaron: 00:15:08\n\nThen you can remember it and you can tell people and you don't forget.\nIt's much easier to remember.\n\nSjors: 00:15:13\n\nAnd you can go on TV and say, remember \"rabbit, big, fish\".\nThen people can send money to \"rabbit, big, fish\".\nAnd maybe that's slightly easier than giving them an address, though I'm a little skeptical whether that short name is such a big deal.\nBut this is kind of where we get the privacy gotcha and also the stealth address part.\n\nAaron: 00:15:31\n\nLet's hear it.\n\nSjors: 00:15:32\n\nThe first time you're using this as a recipient, you're going to create an account, you're going to put a transaction on the blockchain.\nIf then later on you receive coins, we're going to assume you use this third methodology, the nice privacy thing, it's going to arrive on different addresses.\nSo that's very nice.\nBut, if you're stupid, or if your wallet is stupid, it's going to combine coins that, you know, are related to that first transaction.\nThe first transaction itself is not spendable because it's an `OP_RETURN`, but maybe it comes from another coin.\n\nAaron: 00:16:04\n\nSure.\n\nSjors: 00:16:05\n\nAnd now you start combining coins and somebody can link your identity to everything you received.\nSo you still need to be very wary of this cluster analysis risk.\nA new wallet could avoid that and warn you about it.\n\nAaron: 00:16:17\n\nNo, that's true.\nYou have coins in your wallet which you're going to use to pay the fee.\nYou probably have more in your wallet than just the fees, so you have change and it's then sort of linked to your account.\nAnd then after which the coins can be linked to even the coins you received privately.\nAnd that's something to be aware of, sure.\n\nSjors: 00:16:40\n\nSo I think it's this initial step where you have to announce something on the blockchain that creates this liability almost.\nNow for some parties that's actually kind of a feature or at least they can manage it.\nIf you're an exchange, you know what you're doing, you're not gonna make those privacy mistakes.\nAnd one of the cool things is that you can, you can, you know, add a DNS record is one of the suggestions so that people can verify that, hey, this DNS record matches this big fish thing.\nAnd that's a nice way to double check.\nI could imagine hardware wallets could also embed some of these well-known codes so that if you're sending to Kraken or whatever, your hardware wallet could say, oh yeah that's actually an address that belongs to that exchange, at least the last time we we updated the firmware to know these accounts.\nIt's kind of nice against clipboard attacks and that sort of stuff.\nBut that's for these schemes in general.\nI don't think you need to have this announcement into blockchain specifically.\nSo if you go to stealth addresses, which I believe is BIP47, mechanism there was slightly different, though I might remember it incorrectly.\nBut the idea there is that you generate a payment code, which is longer, but it's not something you have to put on the blockchain.\nAnd so you can give that code to somebody else, and that's your identity, but that identity is not tied to anything in the blockchain.\nAnd then you do the same magic trick with somebody takes their own key and adds it and does a bunch of math and then sends it to an address.\nAnd then I think there is an announcement on the blockchain, but it's done by the sender.\n\nAaron: 00:18:15\n\nIt's always done by the sender.\nAt least the payment is...\nOh, there's a separate announcement from the payment?\n\n## Explaining Stealth Address Identities\n\nSjors: 00:18:21\n\nSo in the scheme we just talked about in Easypaysy, it's the recipient who has to announce their identity on the blockchain, essentially once.\nBut then when you want to send to them, there's some back and forth.\nBut here in the stealth addresses scheme, it is the sender that needs to make an announcement on the blockchain saying, to a standard address, hey, so they get a payment code and they send one transaction to a standardized address, which is always the same thing, as a handshake.\nAnd then using the handshake, that's how you come up with the unique addresses that you're actually going to use.\nSo the recipient will watch the handshake address and every time it sees a transaction on the handshake address it then knows what other addresses it should be watching.\n\nAaron: 00:19:07\n\nOkay so that does require more blockchain transactions then.\n\nSjors: 00:19:12\n\nI don't know about the number of blockchain transactions, maybe a little bit, but the nice thing is that it's the senders that are sort of sacrificing their privacy, but only really to the recipient and they're doing that anyway, because they're paying the recipient, rather than the recipient revealing it, you know, lowering its privacy.\nBut I don't think it's a huge deal and all of these schemes you can choose to just do more off-chain.\nYou can just have an identifier that you send via email and yeah it's not as short, that's a downside, but it's just a public key in that case and you can do fun things with it.\n\nAaron: 00:19:48\n\nYou want to get into the benefits of this system\n\n## Debating Use Cases for Easypaysy\n\nSjors: 00:19:51\n\nWe did some benefits and some downsides.\nI would like to remind the listeners of a chicken-egg problem that was brought up by the infamous ZmnSCPxj.\n\nAaron: 00:20:04\n\nZ-Man.\n\nSjors: 00:20:05\n\nZ-Man, or as the Canadians say, Zetman.\nIf you're a new Bitcoin user and you want to use this system, you don't have coins to send anywhere.\nSo that's a problem, but there might be ways around it, especially if you're buying coins from an exchange, maybe they can help you set it up.\n\nAaron: 00:20:23\n\nI want to get into more benefits, Sjors.\n\nSjors: 00:20:25\n\nOkay.\n\nAaron: 00:20:26\n\nI think we skipped over the benefits a little bit.\n\nSjors: 00:20:28\n\nI mentioned a few, but give me more.\n\nAaron: 00:20:30\n\nRecurring payments.\nDid we mention that one?\n\nSjors: 00:20:32\n\nNo, we haven't mentioned that, that's a good one.\n\nAaron: 00:20:34\n\nSo recurring payments, so you want to pay rent every month, so your landlord would have to generate a new address every month and, wait, why is this a problem?\n\nSjors: 00:20:46\n\nYou could say it's annoying for the landlord to have to send you an email with an address every month.\n\nAaron: 00:20:51\n\nExactly.\n\nSjors: 00:20:52\n\nAnd then it's nice if you can generate, if you can predict these addresses yourself.\nBut I would immediately say there's a downside to that, because if, let's say my landlord has this magic box that he receives his Bitcoin on and then his magic box breaks but he can't give you a phone call to say \"hey yo don't send me any more Bitcoins\" then your rent just goes into the ether.\n\nAaron: 00:21:18\n\nHe can call you, right?\nHe knows where you live.\n\nSjors: 00:21:22\n\nHe does know where you live.\n\nAaron: 00:21:24\n\nHe probably does.\nHe can ring the bell.\n\nSjors: 00:21:25\n\nBut maybe the postal service is down because of some election issue.\nSo, you know, it can be tricky.\nAnd more generally, let's say you are a very sophisticated recipient of these Bitcoins, maybe you are a landlord and initially you just have a you know you have one tenant that pays rent that way and you just use your little hardware wallet and you generate these addresses that way.\nAll is good and well then you have lots of customers and you have a lot of money.\nMaybe you want to set up a multi-sig cold storage.\nOh but now you have to tell all your clients or your renters to basically use this new payment code.\nSo it's nice if you can just give a new address every month then the customer doesn't have to care how you generate that address.\nYou can do it yourself.\nYou can have all the sophisticated address generation methods you want.\n\nAaron: 00:22:15\n\nSure but here's the thing I think your argument doesn't hold up because I think the idea is that if you're the landlord, you can request payment each month.\nYou just send a message, hey, pay me.\nAnd then your wallets can be programmed to allow this once a month for up to whatever your pay is.\nThat way your wallet doesn't need to know all of the addresses into the future.\nIt just needs to know, okay, it's okay to pay this amount to this account each month, whenever they request it.\n\nSjors: 00:22:46\n\nBut then we really don't need anything in this scheme.\nBecause now what you're talking about is saying okay, our landlord has some sort of public key identifier that you somehow trust, maybe trust on first use.\nIt could be a PGP key or it could be some other, just a Bitcoin key, that your wallet and then there's a protocol where your wallet, where they can request payments from you.\nWhether that's push-based or pull-based, maybe your wallet is running and it's pulling the landlord's server every day to say, \"hey do you have an invoice for me, do you have an invoice for me?\".\nAnd then based on some rules you automatically pay it.\n\nSjors: 00:23:21\n\nI don't think this scheme makes that easier.\nThe biggest complication there is just the okay what does the server look like that you're going to ping what's expected from a wallet should it ping every day, every week, every month, what if it doesn't?\nSo that is an interesting problem to solve but I think that's almost perpendicular to this.\n\nAaron: 00:23:39\n\nOkay then I think the other big benefit is non-repudiation.\n\nSjors: 00:23:44\n\nTell me what is repudiation and what is non-repudiation?\n\n## Aaron explaining what non-repudiation is\n\nAaron: 00:23:47\n\nSo I don't know what repudiation is, but I can perfectly explain what non-repudiation is.\nSo I guess repudiation will be the opposite of that.\nIt means that once you've paid someone, you can prove that you've paid someone.\n\nSjors: 00:24:02\n\nOkay.\n\nAaron: 00:24:02\n\nSo you make some sort of order, I don't know, you order to buy a laptop or a teakettle, I'm just pointing at stuff on your desk right now.\n\nSjors: 00:24:13\n\nA teapot.\n\nAaron: 00:24:15\n\nThat's what it is.\nThat's what you're ordering and then the seller receives the money and after it doesn't ship the order and then when you complain, he says, hey, I never received any money.\nI don't know what you're talking about.\nI don't know who you are.\nGo away.\nAt that point, now with Bitcoin, once you've sent it to a regular Bitcoin address, you have no way to prove that you actually did pay this guy.\n\nSjors: 00:24:38\n\nDepending on how you got the address, right?\n\nAaron: 00:24:41\n\nI guess, I guess.\n\nSjors: 00:24:42\n\nIf you got the address on a website, and then...\n\nAaron: 00:24:44\n\nBut I want to solve it on the Bitcoin blockchain.\nSo now we're solving it on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nSjors: 00:24:49\n\nBut you want to do everything on the blockchain.\nYou sound like an Ethereum person.\nI'm trying to make you a...\n\nAaron: 00:24:54\n\nJust hear me out because I want to finish my story.\nAt this point, normally when you're just sending an address, that guy can just ignore you and claim that he never received a payment.\nNow, thanks to the brilliance of non-repudiation, I can take it to court and I can prove to court, look, this is his account.\nLook, I actually made a payment to this account, I can prove it, he signed it with his communication key or this is his stealth address, I can prove it in all sorts of ways and at that point there's no way for him to deny that he got the payment.\nSo now the judge can order him to finally give me that laptop or tea kettle.\n\nSjors: 00:25:36\n\nRight, or less radical, you can use it in your accounting software.\nSo there's a little bit of an extra check.\nThat payments actually happened where you think they happened.\n\nAaron: 00:25:43\n\nSo you do agree there's a benefit now?\n\nSjors: 00:25:45\n\nI think in general there's a benefit of having receipts essentially.\nAnd basically when you receive an invoice, you really need to have some evidence that you really got that invoice.\nSo normally if you send an invoice by PDF or via email, it should have the address in it.\nAnd that email should be signed by something, maybe just the standard email DKIM whatever stuff.\nAnd then the proof of payment really is just that address now has money.\nBut okay, so that's all cool.\nGreat.\n\nAaron: 00:26:16\n\nBut there's more.\nThere's more.\n\nSjors: 00:26:18\n\nTell me.\n\nAaron: 00:26:18\n\nOkay.\nSo actually I got an email from Jose earlier this month.\nThere's updates to the protocol.\n\nSjors: 00:26:23\n\nBecause just for the listener, this protocol was announced in December.\nThen there were some distractions in the world and I guess.\n\nAaron: 00:26:30\n\nOh, last December?\n\nSjors: 00:26:31\n\nNow he's back on it.\n\nAaron: 00:26:34\n\nI'm going to read the updates to you.\n\nSjors: 00:26:37\n\nOkay.\n\n## Updates to the Easypaysy Protocol\n\nAaron: 00:26:38\n\nOkay.\nUpdate A.\nVertical simplification.\nInteractive payments: most of the scaling solutions, and a few other minor things will be left out of the first implementation of the protocol.\n\nSjors: 00:26:50\n\nOkay, we didn't really talk about the relations to Lightning because that's even more complicated, but what was the first bit again?\n\nAaron: 00:26:56\n\nSo interactive payments, that's going to be left out.\n\nSjors: 00:26:59\n\nAnd interactive payments, was that the second method you were talking about?\n\nAaron: 00:27:01\n\nI think so.\n\nSjors: 00:27:02\n\nOkay, so we already dropped that and now he's dropped it.\n\nAaron: 00:27:06\n\nCool.\nOkay.\n(Update) B: leaner and more powerful transactions.\nDo you know what IOC transactions are?\n\nSjors: 00:27:14\n\nI think that was the cryptographic protocol we were talking about.\n\nAaron: 00:27:19\n\nStealth one?\n\nSjors: 00:27:20\n\nThe stealthy address.\n\nAaron: 00:27:22\n\nOkay okay so IOC transactions don't need the `OP_RETURN` anymore so easypaysy transactions can be as lean as any regular Bitcoin transaction now.\n\nSjors: 00:27:33\n\nOkay, that sounds good for privacy too.\nLike not having these these upper turn things everywhere.\nOkay.\n\nAaron: 00:27:40\n\n(Update) C: Support for SPV wallets.\nThere is a new discovery mechanism that allows for simple support for SPV wallets.\n\nSjors: 00:27:48\n\nBecause we didn't really touch on that, but if you need to monitor the blockchain, that's a little bit more difficult for lightweight wallets to do than for full-fledged wallets.\n\nAaron: 00:27:56\n\nSo apparently that's solved.\n\nSjors: 00:27:58\n\nOkay, great.\n\nAaron: 00:27:59\n\n(Update) D: The business model.\nAs a side effect, the discovery mechanism needed to support SPV wallets opens up the door to having a business model for Easypaysy, since it will now generate revenue for investors and wallet developers.\n\nSjors: 00:28:14\n\nI thought it was an open protocol.\n\nAaron: 00:28:16\n\nNone of this is really explained in the email or maybe if I would take the effort and read the PDF.\nThat's maybe for another time.\n\nSjors: 00:28:24\n\nLet's stick to the main technical points here.\nI mean everybody, you know people, usually you have a business that adds, contributes to the ecosystem with a standard or with some code and they might have their own plan for how to monetize that which doesn't have to be a problem.\n\nAaron: 00:28:38\n\nThat's all I have Sjors.\nYou don't sound very impressed.\n\nSjors: 00:28:43\n\nI mean...\n\nAaron: 00:28:43\n\nyou sound mildly...\n\nSjors: 00:28:45\n\nI was around in the BIP47 days, and there's still only I think one wallet that sort of supports it.\n\nAaron: 00:28:51\n\nWhich is Samurai?\n\nSjors: 00:28:53\n\nSo I do think we need something like this.\nSo in that sense, I am happy that people are working on trying to figure out a good standard for some sort of identity, not in the KYC sense, but in the sense that I know that I'm actually paying this shop that I think I'm paying and some sort of way to make address reuse really hard.\nAlthough I think part of that is already solved.\nI think projects like BTCPay Server have made it ridiculously easy for at least for shops to just never use the same address.\nExchanges should just never use the same address, otherwise they're just completely incompetent.\nOne thing that might be worth noting is there's a development in Lightning by Rusty, who's proposed a system where normally with Lightning you scan an invoice, that's a QR code somewhere, and you pay it.\nThat's it.\nBut this proposal would basically have a QR code where if you scan it, you ping the node, then you get an invoice and you pay it.\nThat might sound trivial, but it means that you can stick a QR code on an orange in the supermarket and like multiple people can buy an orange basically and get a unique invoice for it.\nAnd you can adjust the price real time rather than having everything fixed.\nBecause if you put an actual Lightning invoice on an orange, then after a week the price might be completely wrong.\nSo in this case your orange is more like an identifier that says, hey go to this lightning node and ask me about the price of the orange.\nAnd that sort of solves a lot of these problems too.\nSo you can have fixed identities.\nThe orange could have an identity or it's probably the supermarket that sells the orange.\nAnd So you get sort of the same thing.\nYou can also do recurring payments and all these cool things.\n\nAaron: 00:30:37\n\nWith an orange?\n\nSjors: 00:30:38\n\nWith an orange, yes.\nBut the thing is, I think there should also be systems like this for just regular Bitcoin transactions.\n\nAaron: 00:30:48\n\nWhat you're saying is it's basically solved for Lightning or there's a very, but..\n\nSjors: 00:30:53\n\nIt's not solved for Lightning, but it is easier to solve for Lightning, because Lightning you have to have a running node anyway.\n\nAaron: 00:30:58\n\nAnd that's one of the critiques that I've heard of this solution as well, that why focus on on-chain, let's just move this type of stuff to Lightning.\n\nSjors: 00:31:09\n\nYou could for smaller payments, but I don't want to pay my rent with Lightning.\n\nAaron: 00:31:12\n\nExactly, what you're saying is, no, no, it would actually be good to have it on-chain as well.\nIt's just you're not necessarily convinced that Easypaysy is the way to go.\n\nSjors: 00:31:21\n\nNo, but I'm not saying there's any other specific way to go.\nMy guess is because there's so many different ways to go and not a lot of people are enthusiastic about building it, it's gonna be in a bike shedding-ish state for many more years.\nSo my hope is that on Lightning we'll get all this sorted out more quickly and then maybe whatever happens on Lightning can inspire on chain.\nOr for that matter maybe you just run your Lightning Node software and let it hand out some on-chain addresses when needed.\nSo Lightning might be the default, but for big payments you do use on-chain, but you use all the Lightning protocol stuff, including the encryption and the routing and the 24-7 server to take care of generating on-chain addresses and verifying payments.\nSomething like that.\nThat's all I have.\n\nAaron: 00:32:15\n\nI'm through.\nAll right.\nI was just thinking of that XRCP or whatever XKCD cartoon about standards.\n\nSjors: 00:32:26\n\nOh yeah, let's make another standard.\n\nAaron: 00:32:28\n\nYes.\nAll right.\nAnyways.\n\nSjors: 00:32:31\n\nShould we close it out?\n\nAaron: 00:32:32\n\nLet's do that.\n\nSjors: 00:32:33\n\nAll right, everybody.\nThank you for listening to The Van Wirdum Sjorsnado.\n\nAaron: 00:32:38\n\nThere you go.\n\n",

    "summary": "In a recent episode of their podcast, Sjors Provoost and Aaron van Wirdum tackle the nuanced subject of Bitcoin transaction privacy and the innovative Easypaysy system proposed by Jose Femenias Canuelo. Their discussion begins with an acknowledgment of the common yet privacy-compromising practice of reusing Bitcoin addresses, which they argue not only reduces the anonymity of the sender but also puts the receiver's privacy at risk by making transactions traceable. The duo goes on to explore the benefits of generating new addresses for each transaction, a feature supported by most contemporary wallets that, despite its slight inconvenience, is vital for maintaining the anonymity essential to the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe conversation soon shifts towards the potential solution offered by the Easypaysy system. This system, as explained by the hosts, uses the Bitcoin blockchain itself to create accounts through a special transaction. This involves a multi-signature input with two public keys and an `OP_RETURN` output containing payment instructions, thus allowing for secure and private transactions without necessitating external communication protocols or servers. Such a design significantly enhances security by enabling the value key to be stored in cold storage, thereby protecting funds even if the communication key is compromised.\n\nDelving deeper into the operational aspects of the Easypaysy system, the podcast outlines three methods of receiving funds: the discouraged practice of address reuse, the secure exchange of unique addresses via back-and-forth communication using the communication key, and the utilization of stealth addresses for automated, non-interactive address generation. The latter, inspired by stealth address technology, ensures secure fund transfers without exposing transaction details to third parties, marking a significant step forward in preserving privacy within the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nFurthermore, Provoost and Van Wirdum provide valuable insights into the broader context of Bitcoin transactions, touching upon the challenges and opportunities presented by automated verifiable transactions and the concept of non-repudiation. They discuss the importance of establishing trust through public key identifiers and the critical role of non-repudiation in dispute resolutions within digital commerce.
