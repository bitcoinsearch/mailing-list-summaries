activation.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"This has become a topic again in the sort of Bitcoin debate community public discourse.\\nHow do we activate soft forks?\\nBecause Taproot is getting to the point where it sort of ready to be deployed almost I think, so now the next question is, \\\"Okay, how are we actually going to activate this?\\\" This has been an issue in the past with several soft forks.\\nAnd it came up in the mailing list, I think a couple of months ago.\\nAnd now it's sort of reemerged, there's now a IRC channel where it's being debated, there's a Telegram's channel.\\nI wrote an article on it.\\nIt's back on the death list.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah, I read the whole IRC channel.\\nNo, actually I started reading the IRC channel.\\nI got stuck at the meta discussion about whether or not there should be a Telegram channel and whether or not you need to ask permission.\\nAnd whether or not asking permission was off topic in the IRC channel.\\nAnd after an hour I gave up, but you spent your entire Saturday I believe?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I spent most of my Saturday reading through all of the logs and sort of trying to summarize it into an article.\\nI didn't read past Saturday, so if there was any sort of big discussion or development since Saturday, I might be out of the loop a little bit, but that wasn't really my impression.\\nI think I covered most of it.\\nSo I think we can cover most of it in the podcast as well.\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"Soft forks explained\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So maybe we should say what a soft fork is.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Let's start there.\\nWhat is a soft fork Sjors?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So it's basically a tightening of the rules.\\nAn analogy I like to make is with kosher food.\\nI've made this analogy three times today.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes, this is the first time you're making an analogy because we're recording this start of the podcast for the third time which is a pain, but let's just go on.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"But basically kosher food is a subset of regular food.\\nSo there's a few things you don't eat.\\nSo often you might not notice it.\\nThere's a lot of soft drinks that are kosher and you wouldn't know the difference.\\nBut sometimes you would know the difference and that could be a problem.\\nBut with Bitcoin, there is no such problem.\\nBecause the things that are no longer allowed after soft fork are very stupid things.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah, so hang on.\\nThe thing you're saying is that soft fork is backwards compatible in the context of Bitcoin.\\nAnd the reason for that is like let's say I go to a restaurant every day because I love the food there, and then one day they introduce kosher foods and the food is still great.\\nI can still go there, because I don't care if it's kosher or not.\\nRight?\\nSo there're tiny rules.\\nI didn't care about whether or not it's kosher, so it's fine for me.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah, but you would if your favorite recipe was now kicked out of the restaurant, but it turns out...\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I would care if they get bacon out of the fridge.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Exactly.\\nBut this is not the case in the way Bitcoin soft fork works.\\nSo they wouldn't remove your bacon, basically.\\nThey would remove your ability to stab yourself basically.\\nAnd so it's a nice and elegant way to make the rules more strict without suddenly freezing anybody's coins.\\nSo normal people can keep using it.\\nThey don't have to upgrade.\\nThey can keep using the old rules if they want to.\\nAn exchange can basically ignore SegWit for years and it's perfectly fine, as far as the blockchain is concerned.\\nI guess we can talk about some examples.\\nSo Satoshi introduced soft fork in the very beginning, in a way that we wouldn't do anymore.\\nBasically, one of the things he did was introduce a one megabyte limit.\\nThere was no limit, he realized that was bad or dangerous.\\nSo he put in a limit and then later on when it was already active, he said, \\\"Oh, by the way, there's a limit.\\\"\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So that's an interesting example that I didn't mention in my article for Bitcoin magazine, which is...\\nI mean, we're going to discuss how to implement soft forks, how to upgrade the protocol.\\nAnd one of the examples that's Satoshi used was to basically just snuck it in there.\\nAnd only once people are running the code, they'll figure out that there's now one megabyte limit.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Right.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Which worked at a time, I guess.\\nAnd maybe it was even a good way to do it because in his mind he was probably fixing like an attack factor.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"And in that case, it makes sense because you tell people about it and that increases the chance of the attack factor being exploited.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Right.\\nBut it could also happen by accident.\\nYou accidentally add a rule to the system that you didn't know was there.\\nSo that sort of stuff could happen, but that's not what we're going to talk about.\\nWe're going to talk about a deliberate change in the rules.\\nSo the other way that was done when there was a new rule, was a flag day.\\nTo say, \\\"Basically from this day forward, this new rule shall apply.\\\" And you announced that plenty of time in advance, and then people upgrade and it's all good.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah.\\nSo you're going to say like, \\\"One year from now,\\\" so that's like July 24th when this is being published I think.\\n\\\"July 24th, 2021, that's when the new rules are enacted.\\\"\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Right.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Or you say at block height annual.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah, exactly.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Some block height in the future, at this point the new rule is enacted.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"But there was still a problem there, which is that you want to make sure that everybody's actually running the new software.\\nAnd especially that miners are running the new software, because they kind of have to enforce those new rules.\\nI mean, it's really nice if they enforce the new rules.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Well, everyone's enforcing the new rules.\\nOr at least everyone who's upgraded is enforcing the new rules.\\nBut if a majority of hash power does it, that means they always reclaim the launch chain even for the non-upgraded nodes, like they still consider that the [Fallout 00:05:49] chain.\\nSo then everyone, old and new nodes will converge on this chain.\\nSo that's why it's very nice if a majority hash power enforces the rules as well.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Exactly.\\nAnd for miners there's a risk.\\nIf a majority of miners enforces the new rules, but a minority doesn't, they could accidentally mine the wrong block.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"The minority could mine an invalid block and then have their block orphaned.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Exactly.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"They might not even know why, if they're not upgraded.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Exactly.\\nSo it's nice if miners signal that they're ready to do this upgrade, so that you can get an idea, \\\"Okay, most miners are clearly ready, and the few miners that are not, well hopefully they'll be fine.\\\"\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So that's sort of the other upgrade strategy, apart from just stuffing it in there without telling anyone.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah.\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"BIP 9, BIP 91 and BIP 143 soft fork activation mechanisms\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"You have flag days and you have miner activation.\\nSo signaling.\\nSo the signaling works as a coordination mechanism for the network to figure out, \\\"Okay, enough miners have upgraded now.\\\" This signals to everyone the network is ready.\\nAnd through this signaling mechanism, a date or a time, or a block height is communicated essentially.\\nThat's embedded in the code, that if enough signals are included in the blockchain, then we all know at block height X, the new rules will go into effect.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Exactly.\\nSo usually it's every two weeks you count the number of blocks that have the signal.\\nAnd if it's above a certain threshold, for example, 95%, then you know that two weeks later the new rule is active.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"That was BIP 9.\\nIs what you're explaining now.\\nThe Bitcoin Improvements Proposal 9 uses this difficulty period, 95%.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So these are the three main mechanisms, right?\\nYou can just randomly do this.\\nYou can announce a date and you can have miner signal up to a certain threshold.\\nAnd now the question is, what are you going to do for Taproot?\\nAnd what have we done in the past?\\nAnd maybe you want to combine some of these methods.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So mention why BIP 9 is a problem?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So BIP 9 was used a couple of times to deploy some features, I believe.\\nBut when it was time to deploy SegWit, it took a long time.\\nLike we don't know if it would've happened eventually, but I think for at least half a year or so that the code was ready, it just didn't activate.\\nOnly a small percentage of miners were signaling for it, or at least not the 95%.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes.\\nBut we have a pretty good idea why that was.\\nI mean, at least the miners that were blocking it were telling us why they were blocking it.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes, exactly.\\nI mean it's possible that some miners were just completely not interested.\\nBut there was definitely miners that were actively not signaling in.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah.\\nMiner apathy.\\nThat was probably a factor for at least some miners.\\nSure.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So what happened then, is a number of different things happened outside the blockchain.\\nThere was basically a group of people that said, \\\"Hey, you know what?\\nWe're just going to, instead of the signaling, we're just going to go back to the old flag day approach.\\\" And that was called BIP 148.\\nSo they picked April 1st, 2017 and basically said, \\\"Well, our nodes are now going to enforce these rules.\\\"\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"But hang on.\\nSo to explain this real quick, like the downside of BIP 9 was that miners were blocking the upgrade, because they wanted either political leverage, or they were secretly benefiting from something that the upgrade would've fixed without telling anyone that that was the case.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Or both.\\nBut there were bad reasons basically for the miners to block this upgrade and this made Bitcoin core developers and other Bitcoiners realize that, \\\"Okay, that's actually kind of a downside to BIP 9.\\\"\\nBecause it gives miners this leverage, which they shouldn't have at all.\\nLike they're treating it like a vote and they're sort of abusing their vote in ways that's bad.\\nWhy it's not even meant to be a vote, it's just meant to be a coordination mechanism.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Exactly.\\nAnd also the reasons why you might want to oppose a proposal, generally should be technical in nature and not political.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So I guess that.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So ultimately this is what you were getting at.\\nThis was resolved in some way or another, and there's still debate to this day how it was resolved exactly.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Right.\\nBecause two things happened at the same time, right?\\nYou had the BIP 148 (UASF) rules, the guys with the guns and the nodes.\\nAnd-\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"With the hats.\\nI don't think they had guns, but they had hats.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Some of them had guns.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"[crosstalk 00:10:29].\\nThat's true.\\nI think they were like...\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"In the forest, defending the Bitcoin.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes.\\nThat's true.\\nAnd I think [inaudible 00:10:35] had like a knife.\\nWhatever.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"And so...\\nThen the question is, you can tell if you read all the social media and the mailing lists, that obviously played a role.\\nBut if you just look at the blockchain, you can't really tell.\\nBecause what you see in the blockchain is, all of a sudden 95% started signaling and the thing activated.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sure.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Now it's of course very remarkable that this activated exactly before August 1st and not some random other date that it could have happened.\\nBut there were no blocks rejected that we could still point at saying, \\\"Hey look, there was actually a fight between miners and et cetera.\\\" At the same time, there was an initiative from the New York Agreement Group.\\nAnd they had a whole bunch of things that they were planning to do.\\nBut one thing they were doing is called BIP 91 and they were basically, \\\"Lower the threshold.\\\" So they said, \\\"Instead of having 95%, we're just going to accept 75%.\\\"\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Well, to be a little bit more precise, what they did in the end was use 75% forced signaling.\\nSo it was like BIP 148, but it was like a soft fork to activate a soft fork.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So basically you had to signal that you were going to activate the soft fork.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"And then because there was more signaling, it would activate.\\nBut then again, you cannot tell from the chain, because immediately people started signaling at 95%.\\nAnd so that's the nice thing about these kind of situations.\\nYou can't really tell what happened.\\nIt didn't go wrong.\\nLike nobody called each other's bluff.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes.\\nAnd I think everyone agrees that it was at least sort of a tense period and it showed everyone that maybe we've got to rethink how we're actually going to do soft fork's, because this was very close to becoming a huge mess.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"If you think through the worst case scenarios, so I guess we'll just avoid now because it'll get too confusing.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"But if you have chain splits and especially if you have multiple chain splits with people having different opinions about what the blockchain should be, that kind of defeats the purpose of a well-functioning blockchain.\\nSo it's something you want to avoid.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes.\\nAnd let's skip the details.\\nBut there was a risk of it becoming a pretty big mess.\\nI think that we both agree on that.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I was worried for quite a while it would be an absolute clusterfuck.\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"BIP 8 for soft fork activation\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So, new ideas.\\nHow are we going to think about soft forks and soft fork activating from now on?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Well, one thing that was done is a revamped proposal called BIP 8.\\nAnd yes, that's a lower number because the proposal was older.\\nBut now it's actually newer, so that is confusing.\\nBut generally there were just a couple of improvements to the original mechanism.\\nMaybe not super interesting, for example, using blocks instead of dates.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Well, explain what BIP 8 is in the first place.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Well, BIP 8 was I think just a flag date proposal.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Was it originally just a flag date?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah, I think so.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Okay.\\nBut later it was definitely...\\nLike the idea was that it was a combination of BIP 9 and a flag date basically.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Right.\\nSo what it is now at least, that's probably the most useful thing to describe.\\nIs the signaling is still there with some tweaks, but there is also a built in option to have a flag date.\\nAnd now BIP is just a sort of a proposal of how you could do things.\\nAnd so you could use a flag date or you could not use the flag date.\\nBut the proposal now explains, okay, if you have a flag date, this is how you do it.\\nAnd it's a one way mechanism.\\nSo you could propose a new soft fork and not set a flag date, and then later on set a flag date.\\nBut you cannot propose a flag date and then unset it, basically.\\nSo if you decide on a flag date, you better go through with it.\\nSo it kind of [crosstalk 00:14:30].\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Well, you can release a new client that doesn't have the flag date of course.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"But now you have a mess, because you have...\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Well, one of the nice things about BIP 8 is actually that it doesn't have a flag date purely.\\nIt has a forced signaling deadline.\\nSo it's kind of like BIP 148 before, where if you have the flag date on, so let's just call it the flag date for now.\\nThen it doesn't mean that it activates the soft fork itself.\\nIt means that if near the end any block that's not mining activation, not mining support for the soft fork, that block will be orphaned.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Right.\\nSo it forces signaling towards the end.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So this means that if you have two groups of BIP 8 nodes, one of them has the forced signaling on and one of them has the forced signaling off.\\nBut miners go along with the forced signaling on, then the nodes that have forced signaling off, will still accept the soft fork because they're still seeing all-\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"They're still seeing the signaling.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Exactly, so that's a slight change from previous BIP 8.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah.\\nAnd I forgot whether...\\nI think if you have a flag date in mind, you may still need to put it in there because you don't want different people to have different flag dates.\\nSo I guess it doesn't matter if you force signaling, but it just becomes a mess.\\nBecause if you force people to signal and then they don't signal, and you just decide to not accept all their blocks.\\nIf only a small number of people do that, then you still get a mess.\\nSo I don't think it's completely thought out, but you probably still want to have some consensus.\\nIf you decide on the flag date, you want to have a very large consensus on what that flag date is and that really everybody goes along with it.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Maybe.\\nI mean, it depends, right?\\nLike even if you don't have consensus, but at least miners don't want to see splits.\\nOr they could play it safe.\\nThat's sort of how BIP 148 happens.\\nRight?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah.\\nBut now imagine if you had two different, like you had the August 1 group and you had the August 15 group.\\nAnd maybe it didn't activate at August 1, but some like major exchanges decided to join the August 1 group and some other major exchanges decided to join the August 15 group.\\nAnd so it would still be a mess.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes.\\nThe assumption is that in that case, or the hope is that in that case, miners just go for the August 1 one.\\nSo they don't split the network.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"That's one option.\\nBut I think at least an improvement here is that let's say you just have miner apathy.\\nYou thought you can get 95% signaling, but there's apathy.\\nYou can have another discussion on mailing lists and everybody says, \\\"Yeah, yeah.\\nWe're fine with this upgrade.\\\" And no miner is objecting to it, they just not bothering to upgrade their software to signal.\\nThen you can calmly agree on a date, as a flag gate, and just calmly add it and there's not going to be too much chaos.\\nBut you still have the problem of the miners not enforcing the rules.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Okay.\\nSo I think these are sort of the basics of BIP 8.\\nAnd the next thing is that you can sort of play around with the parameters in all sorts of way.\\nSo we've already mentioned with or without flag day.\\nAnd the flag day in turn can be an actual flag day or forced signaling.\\nThen you can play around with like a parameter of how long, how far into the future should this flag day be.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yep.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"You can play with a parameter of how much hash power it is.\\nSo far we've mentioned 95%, but you could lower this.\\nYou could say 75% is enough.\\n50% is enough.\\nEven 1% is enough.\\nYou could potentially do that.\\nRight?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah.\\nThat's pretty useless, but you could.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I agree.\\nBut like the point is you can play around with these permutations in all sorts of ways.\\nSo now you sort of have pieces of the puzzle and then you can think of ways to put these pieces together, to come up with like a concrete activation strategy that we're going to use for Taproot.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"But you can also imagine that there's going to be a lot of permutations.\\nAnd so this could be a byte shedding nightmare.\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"Different proposals for taproot activation\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes it could.\\nBut should we cover some of the sort of general ideas that are floating around?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah, sure.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Okay.\\nSo one idea that has been proposed by Matt Corallo, a well known core contributor, is he calls it modern soft fork activation.\\nSo what he proposes is, let's use BIP 8 without forced signaling on the end, or without forced activation on the end for a year.\\nSo that's more like BIP 9, that's what we used to do.\\nSee if miners activate it, just requiring a 95% hash power support threshold, let's see if they do it or not.\\nIf they do it, great.\\nSoft fork has been activated.\\nIf they don't, then phase two of this proposal comes into play which is six months of developer reconsideration.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So developers see if there was a good reason for miners to block it.\\nMaybe there was a problem with the proposal, in this case Taproot, that they hadn't considered before.\\nSo developers are just going to sort of reconsider.\\nIf after six months they haven't found anything wrong with the proposal and they conclude that, okay, it's actually just miner apathy or miners trying something or whatever, like no good reason, then we're going to deploy it again.\\nThis time BIP 8 with either forced signaling or...\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"With a flag day.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Flag day on the end.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I think Matt's original idea was flag day on the end, but he's probably open to forced signaling I would imagine.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I mean, the question is if you have a flag day, what do you do on the flag day?\\nAnd one thing you can do with the flag day is enforce the soft fork and the other is you can force the signaling, which then triggers the soft fork.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Well, exactly.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So I don't think that's...\\nThat's more of a detail and it's probably not controversial to force the signaling instead of forcing the soft fork.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I think that wouldn't be very controversial.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Just makes it more compatible with what other people are doing.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes, exactly.\\nSo that would probably be, yeah.\\nOkay.\\nSo that's one idea, it has the benefits of sort of taking it easy and reconsidering if there's maybe something wrong with the proposal.\\nAnd if there is something wrong with the proposal that people don't have to actually need to upgrade their soft fork, they can just keep running whatever they were running.\\nBecause there was a time out anyway in the soft fork, it just didn't happen.\\nAnd it's sort of fine, there's no sort of emergency upgrades needed at all or anything like that.\\nThe downside is that if miners don't cooperate, it's going to take a long time before the soft fork actually is live on the network, like three and a half years.\\nSo that means App developers have to wait three and a half years.\\nEveryone's just sort of stuck waiting for three and a half years for basically no good reason.\\nSo that's why some people really don't like this proposal.\\nWhat do you think?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Well, you're going to think in the long run, right?\\nSo it's nice if you can have these improvements ship very quickly.\\nBut if there is a tradition that developers decide on a soft fork and it gets activated quickly, well then maybe a government starts calling developers and saying, \\\"Hey, we have this KYC soft fork.\\nAnd since nobody really pays attention and miners are run anything you want, why don't you just make that soft fork and don't worry about the review process?\\\" So you don't want to put too much power in the hands of the developers.\\nThey don't want that kind of power because it means they're going to get very unpleasant phone calls at some point.\\nSo.\\nIt's a difficult trade off, because on the time scale of 200 years, it really doesn't matter if the soft fork takes three years longer.\\nBut we have no idea what the right time is, maybe it makes no difference for this political problem.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},

problem.\\n[crosstalk 00:23:00].\\nI'd like to see it deployed soon and hopefully miners are excited.\\nBut it's going to get more and more difficult to deploy these things in general because if you get, and we want that, lots and lots of very small individual mining pools while trying to get 95%, even just to communicate to them is going to be harder.\\nAnd that's a good thing, but it could slow things down.\\nVery...\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sure.\\nSo another idea is BIP 8, let's say with like a year deadline at which

{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So my problem with the forced signal is, if you ship this thing and you say, \\\"Okay, miners can signal for it.\\nBut if they don't, it's going to activate.\\\" You kind of lock yourself into that outcome.\\nThere's no real way to object anymore.\\nBecause even if miners come up and say, \\\"Hey, wait a minute, there is a problem.\\\" Then you can't cancel it anymore, because people are this new soft fork and they have the forced signaling in.\\nSo lots of people would see their nodes just stop.\\nAnd so you're essentially having a hard fork if you decide to not do it.\\nSo what I think you should do at minimum is say, \\\"We ship this version without the hard coded date in it, but

upgrade.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"But the question is when are people going to bother to review it?\\nAnd I could imagine that if

what happens.\\nSo for example, if after a year it's still not activated, then developers can sort of try to find out why it hasn't activated again, sort of similar to Matt's idea.\\nDevelopers take their time.\\nThey figure out, \\\"Okay, there's actually no good reason that it's not being X failed.\\\" At that point, they can deploy a new client that has sort of BIP 91 in it, which forces

another idea which is, I guess, is it the opposite as a previous one?\\nMaybe not.\\nYou take BIP 8 with a long period, but without forced signaling at the end.\\nThen you still keep an eye on what's happening.\\nIf after a while you find that there is no problem with it, but miners aren't signaling for it because they're just apathetic or they have another bad reason.\\nThen you can deploy another client with BIP 8, this time with forced signaling that starts forced signaling before the end of the current signaling period.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Okay.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Aaron van Wirdum:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Or at least not later than that.\\nLike if it starts before

forced signaling.\\nSo if they do so the forced signaling stuff, then the older BIP 8 nodes will also accept that as an upgrade.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sjors Provoost:\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Oh, well that sounds like a regular idea of BIP 8.\\nRight.\\nSo BIP 8 has the option to allow soft fork signaling.\\nSo initially you do not ship that option, and

{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Well, like I said, I don't like the idea of hard coding a flag date initially.\\nSo I can see the benefit of, you ship something, you wait.\\nSay it has a year of a window.\\nYou wait for six months and then you still don't see any signaling, but you also don't see the miners that reviewed your code and found problems.\\nThen maybe you say, \\\"Okay, let's do a

    "body": "Aaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nWe're going to discuss Taproot activation, or more generally soft fork activation.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nThis has become a topic again in the sort of Bitcoin debate community public discourse.\r\nHow do we activate soft forks?\r\nBecause Taproot is getting to the point where it sort of ready to be deployed almost I think, so now the next question is, \"Okay, how are we actually going to activate this?\" This has been an issue in the past with several soft forks.\r\nAnd it came up in the mailing list, I think a couple of months ago.\r\nAnd now it's sort of reemerged, there's now a IRC channel where it's being debated, there's a Telegram's channel.\r\nI wrote an article on it.\r\nIt's back on the death list.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nYeah, I read the whole IRC channel.\r\nNo, actually I started reading the IRC channel.\r\nI got stuck at the meta discussion about whether or not there should be a Telegram channel and whether or not you need to ask permission.\r\nAnd whether or not asking permission was off topic in the IRC channel.\r\nAnd after an hour I gave up, but you spent your entire Saturday I believe?\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nI spent most of my Saturday reading through all of the logs and sort of trying to summarize it into an article.\r\nI didn't read past Saturday, so if there was any sort of big discussion or development since Saturday, I might be out of the loop a little bit, but that wasn't really my impression.\r\nI think I covered most of it.\r\nSo I think we can cover most of it in the podcast as well.\r\n\r\n## Soft forks explained\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nSo maybe we should say what a soft fork is.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nLet's start there.\r\nWhat is a soft fork Sjors?\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nSo it's basically a tightening of the rules.\r\nAn analogy I like to make is with kosher food.\r\nI've made this analogy three times today.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYes, this is the first time you're making an analogy because we're recording this start of the podcast for the third time which is a pain, but let's just go on.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nBut basically kosher food is a subset of regular food.\r\nSo there's a few things you don't eat.\r\nSo often you might not notice it.\r\nThere's a lot of soft drinks that are kosher and you wouldn't know the difference.\r\nBut sometimes you would know the difference and that could be a problem.\r\nBut with Bitcoin, there is no such problem.\r\nBecause the things that are no longer allowed after soft fork are very stupid things.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYeah, so hang on.\r\nThe thing you're saying is that soft fork is backwards compatible in the context of Bitcoin.\r\nAnd the reason for that is like let's say I go to a restaurant every day because I love the food there, and then one day they introduce kosher foods and the food is still great.\r\nI can still go there, because I don't care if it's kosher or not.\r\nRight?\r\nSo there're tiny rules.\r\nI didn't care about whether or not it's kosher, so it's fine for me.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nYeah, but you would if your favorite recipe was now kicked out of the restaurant, but it turns out...\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nI would care if they get bacon out of the fridge.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nExactly.\r\nBut this is not the case in the way Bitcoin soft fork works.\r\nSo they wouldn't remove your bacon, basically.\r\nThey would remove your ability to stab yourself basically.\r\nAnd so it's a nice and elegant way to make the rules more strict without suddenly freezing anybody's coins.\r\nSo normal people can keep using it.\r\nThey don't have to upgrade.\r\nThey can keep using the old rules if they want to.\r\nAn exchange can basically ignore SegWit for years and it's perfectly fine, as far as the blockchain is concerned.\r\nI guess we can talk about some examples.\r\nSo Satoshi introduced soft fork in the very beginning, in a way that we wouldn't do anymore.\r\nBasically, one of the things he did was introduce a one megabyte limit.\r\nThere was no limit, he realized that was bad or dangerous.\r\nSo he put in a limit and then later on when it was already active, he said, \"Oh, by the way, there's a limit.\"\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nSo that's an interesting example that I didn't mention in my article for Bitcoin magazine, which is...\r\nI mean, we're going to discuss how to implement soft forks, how to upgrade the protocol.\r\nAnd one of the examples that's Satoshi used was to basically just snuck it in there.\r\nAnd only once people are running the code, they'll figure out that there's now one megabyte limit.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nRight.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nWhich worked at a time, I guess.\r\nAnd maybe it was even a good way to do it because in his mind he was probably fixing like an attack factor.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nAnd in that case, it makes sense because you tell people about it and that increases the chance of the attack factor being exploited.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nRight.\r\nBut it could also happen by accident.\r\nYou accidentally add a rule to the system that you didn't know was there.\r\nSo that sort of stuff could happen, but that's not what we're going to talk about.\r\nWe're going to talk about a deliberate change in the rules.\r\nSo the other way that was done when there was a new rule, was a flag day.\r\nTo say, \"Basically from this day forward, this new rule shall apply.\" And you announced that plenty of time in advance, and then people upgrade and it's all good.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\nSo you're going to say like, \"One year from now,\" so that's like July 24th when this is being published I think.\r\n\"July 24th, 2021, that's when the new rules are enacted.\"\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nRight.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nOr you say at block height annual.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nYeah, exactly.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nSome block height in the future, at this point the new rule is enacted.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nBut there was still a problem there, which is that you want to make sure that everybody's actually running the new software.\r\nAnd especially that miners are running the new software, because they kind of have to enforce those new rules.\r\nI mean, it's really nice if they enforce the new rules.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nWell, everyone's enforcing the new rules.\r\nOr at least everyone who's upgraded is enforcing the new rules.\r\nBut if a majority of hash power does it, that means they always reclaim the launch chain even for the non-upgraded nodes, like they still consider that the [Fallout 00:05:49] chain.\r\nSo then everyone, old and new nodes will converge on this chain.\r\nSo that's why it's very nice if a majority hash power enforces the rules as well.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nExactly.\r\nAnd for miners there's a risk.\r\nIf a majority of miners enforces the new rules, but a minority doesn't, they could accidentally mine the wrong block.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nThe minority could mine an invalid block and then have their block orphaned.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nExactly.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nThey might not even know why, if they're not upgraded.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nExactly.\r\nSo it's nice if miners signal that they're ready to do this upgrade, so that you can get an idea, \"Okay, most miners are clearly ready, and the few miners that are not, well hopefully they'll be fine.\"\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nSo that's sort of the other upgrade strategy, apart from just stuffing it in there without telling anyone.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\n## BIP 9, BIP 91 and BIP 143 soft fork activation mechanisms\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYou have flag days and you have miner activation.\r\nSo signaling.\r\nSo the signaling works as a coordination mechanism for the network to figure out, \"Okay, enough miners have upgraded now.\" This signals to everyone the network is ready.\r\nAnd through this signaling mechanism, a date or a time, or a block height is communicated essentially.\r\nThat's embedded in the code, that if enough signals are included in the blockchain, then we all know at block height X, the new rules will go into effect.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nExactly.\r\nSo usually it's every two weeks you count the number of blocks that have the signal.\r\nAnd if it's above a certain threshold, for example, 95%, then you know that two weeks later the new rule is active.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nThat was BIP 9.\r\nIs what you're explaining now.\r\nThe Bitcoin Improvements Proposal 9 uses this difficulty period, 95%.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nSo these are the three main mechanisms, right?\r\nYou can just randomly do this.\r\nYou can announce a date and you can have miner signal up to a certain threshold.\r\nAnd now the question is, what are you going to do for Taproot?\r\nAnd what have we done in the past?\r\nAnd maybe you want to combine some of these methods.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nSo mention why BIP 9 is a problem?\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nSo BIP 9 was used a couple of times to deploy some features, I believe.\r\nBut when it was time to deploy SegWit, it took a long time.\r\nLike we don't know if it would've happened eventually, but I think for at least half a year or so that the code was ready, it just didn't activate.\r\nOnly a small percentage of miners were signaling for it, or at least not the 95%.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYes.\r\nBut we have a pretty good idea why that was.\r\nI mean, at least the miners that were blocking it were telling us why they were blocking it.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nYes, exactly.\r\nI mean it's possible that some miners were just completely not interested.\r\nBut there was definitely miners that were actively not signaling in.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\nMiner apathy.\r\nThat was probably a factor for at least some miners.\r\nSure.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nSo what happened then, is a number of different things happened outside the blockchain.\r\nThere was basically a group of people that said, \"Hey, you know what?\r\nWe're just going to, instead of the signaling, we're just going to go back to the old flag day approach.\" And that was called BIP 148.\r\nSo they picked April 1st, 2017 and basically said, \"Well, our nodes are now going to enforce these rules.\"\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nBut hang on.\r\nSo to explain this real quick, like the downside of BIP 9 was that miners were blocking the upgrade, because they wanted either political leverage, or they were secretly benefiting from something that the upgrade would've fixed without telling anyone that that was the case.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nOr both.\r\nBut there were bad reasons basically for the miners to block this upgrade and this made Bitcoin core developers and other Bitcoiners realize that, \"Okay, that's actually kind of a downside to BIP 9.\"\r\nBecause it gives miners this leverage, which they shouldn't have at all.\r\nLike they're treating it like a vote and they're sort of abusing their vote in ways that's bad.\r\nWhy it's not even meant to be a vote, it's just meant to be a coordination mechanism.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nExactly.\r\nAnd also the reasons why you might want to oppose a proposal, generally should be technical in nature and not political.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nSo I guess that.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nSo ultimately this is what you were getting at.\r\nThis was resolved in some way or another, and there's still debate to this day how it was resolved exactly.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nRight.\r\nBecause two things happened at the same time, right?\r\nYou had the BIP 148 (UASF) rules, the guys with the guns and the nodes.\r\nAnd-\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nWith the hats.\r\nI don't think they had guns, but they had hats.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nSome of them had guns.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\n[crosstalk 00:10:29].\r\nThat's true.\r\nI think they were like...\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nIn the forest, defending the Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYes.\r\nThat's true.\r\nAnd I think [inaudible 00:10:35] had like a knife.\r\nWhatever.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nAnd so...\r\nThen the question is, you can tell if you read all the social media and the mailing lists, that obviously played a role.\r\nBut if you just look at the blockchain, you can't really tell.\r\nBecause what you see in the blockchain is, all of a sudden 95% started signaling and the thing activated.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nSure.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nNow it's of course very remarkable that this activated exactly before August 1st and not some random other date that it could have happened.\r\nBut there were no blocks rejected that we could still point at saying, \"Hey look, there was actually a fight between miners and et cetera.\" At the same time, there was an initiative from the New York Agreement Group.\r\nAnd they had a whole bunch of things that they were planning to do.\r\nBut one thing they were doing is called BIP 91 and they were basically, \"Lower the threshold.\" So they said, \"Instead of having 95%, we're just going to accept 75%.\"\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nWell, to be a little bit more precise, what they did in the end was use 75% forced signaling.\r\nSo it was like BIP 148, but it was like a soft fork to activate a soft fork.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nSo basically you had to signal that you were going to activate the soft fork.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nAnd then because there was more signaling, it would activate.\r\nBut then again, you cannot tell from the chain, because immediately people started signaling at 95%.\r\nAnd so that's the nice thing about these kind of situations.\r\nYou can't really tell what happened.\r\nIt didn't go wrong.\r\nLike nobody called each other's bluff.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYes.\r\nAnd I think everyone agrees that it was at least sort of a tense period and it showed everyone that maybe we've got to rethink how we're actually going to do soft fork's, because this was very close to becoming a huge mess.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nIf you think through the worst case scenarios, so I guess we'll just avoid now because it'll get too confusing.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nBut if you have chain splits and especially if you have multiple chain splits with people having different opinions about what the blockchain should be, that kind of defeats the purpose of a well-functioning blockchain.\r\nSo it's something you want to avoid.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYes.\r\nAnd let's skip the details.\r\nBut there was a risk of it becoming a pretty big mess.\r\nI think that we both agree on that.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nI was worried for quite a while it would be an absolute clusterfuck.\r\n\r\n## BIP 8 for soft fork activation\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nSo, new ideas.\r\nHow are we going to think about soft forks and soft fork activating from now on?\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nWell, one thing that was done is a revamped proposal called BIP 8.\r\nAnd yes, that's a lower number because the proposal was older.\r\nBut now it's actually newer, so that is confusing.\r\nBut generally there were just a couple of improvements to the original mechanism.\r\nMaybe not super interesting, for example, using blocks instead of dates.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nWell, explain what BIP 8 is in the first place.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nWell, BIP 8 was I think just a flag date proposal.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nWas it originally just a flag date?\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nYeah, I think so.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nOkay.\r\nBut later it was definitely...\r\nLike the idea was that it was a combination of BIP 9 and a flag date basically.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nRight.\r\nSo what it is now at least, that's probably the most useful thing to describe.\r\nIs the signaling is still there with some tweaks, but there is also a built in option to have a flag date.\r\nAnd now BIP is just a sort of a proposal of how you could do things.\r\nAnd so you could use a flag date or you could not use the flag date.\r\nBut the proposal now explains, okay, if you have a flag date, this is how you do it.\r\nAnd it's a one way mechanism.\r\nSo you could propose a new soft fork and not set a flag date, and then later on set a flag date.\r\nBut you cannot propose a flag date and then unset it, basically.\r\nSo if you decide on a flag date, you better go through with it.\r\nSo it kind of [crosstalk 00:14:30].\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nWell, you can release a new client that doesn't have the flag date of course.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nBut now you have a mess, because you have...\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nWell, one of the nice things about BIP 8 is actually that it doesn't have a flag date purely.\r\nIt has a forced signaling deadline.\r\nSo it's kind of like BIP 148 before, where if you have the flag date on, so let's just call it the flag date for now.\r\nThen it doesn't mean that it activates the soft fork itself.\r\nIt means that if near the end any block that's not mining activation, not mining support for the soft fork, that block will be orphaned.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nRight.\r\nSo it forces signaling towards the end.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nSo this means that if you have two groups of BIP 8 nodes, one of them has the forced signaling on and one of them has the forced signaling off.\r\nBut miners go along with the forced signaling on, then the nodes that have forced signaling off, will still accept the soft fork because they're still seeing all-\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nThey're still seeing the signaling.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nExactly, so that's a slight change from previous BIP 8.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\nAnd I forgot whether...\r\nI think if you have a flag date in mind, you may still need to put it in there because you don't want different people to have different flag dates.\r\nSo I guess it doesn't matter if you force signaling, but it just becomes a mess.\r\nBecause if you force people to signal and then they don't signal, and you just decide to not accept all their blocks.\r\nIf only a small number of people do that, then you still get a mess.\r\nSo I don't think it's completely thought out, but you probably still want to have some consensus.\r\nIf you decide on the flag date, you want to have a very large consensus on what that flag date is and that really everybody goes along with it.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nMaybe.\r\nI mean, it depends, right?\r\nLike even if you don't have consensus, but at least miners don't want to see splits.\r\nOr they could play it safe.\r\nThat's sort of how BIP 148 happens.\r\nRight?\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\nBut now imagine if you had two different, like you had the August 1 group and you had the August 15 group.\r\nAnd maybe it didn't activate at August 1, but some like major exchanges decided to join the August 1 group and some other major exchanges decided to join the August 15 group.\r\nAnd so it would still be a mess.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYes.\r\nThe assumption is that in that case, or the hope is that in that case, miners just go for the August 1 one.\r\nSo they don't split the network.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nThat's one option.\r\nBut I think at least an improvement here is that let's say you just have miner apathy.\r\nYou thought you can get 95% signaling, but there's apathy.\r\nYou can have another discussion on mailing lists and everybody says, \"Yeah, yeah.\r\nWe're fine with this upgrade.\" And no miner is objecting to it, they just not bothering to upgrade their software to signal.\r\nThen you can calmly agree on a date, as a flag gate, and just calmly add it and there's not going to be too much chaos.\r\nBut you still have the problem of the miners not enforcing the rules.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nOkay.\r\nSo I think these are sort of the basics of BIP 8.\r\nAnd the next thing is that you can sort of play around with the parameters in all sorts of way.\r\nSo we've already mentioned with or without flag day.\r\nAnd the flag day in turn can be an actual flag day or forced signaling.\r\nThen you can play around with like a parameter of how long, how far into the future should this flag day be.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nYep.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYou can play with a parameter of how much hash power it is.\r\nSo far we've mentioned 95%, but you could lower this.\r\nYou could say 75% is enough.\r\n50% is enough.\r\nEven 1% is enough.\r\nYou could potentially do that.\r\nRight?\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\nThat's pretty useless, but you could.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nI agree.\r\nBut like the point is you can play around with these permutations in all sorts of ways.\r\nSo now you sort of have pieces of the puzzle and then you can think of ways to put these pieces together, to come up with like a concrete activation strategy that we're going to use for Taproot.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nBut you can also imagine that there's going to be a lot of permutations.\r\nAnd so this could be a byte shedding nightmare.\r\n\r\n## Different proposals for taproot activation\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYes it could.\r\nBut should we cover some of the sort of general ideas that are floating around?\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nYeah, sure.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nOkay.\r\nSo one idea that has been proposed by Matt Corallo, a well known core contributor, is he calls it modern soft fork activation.\r\nSo what he proposes is, let's use BIP 8 without forced signaling on the end, or without forced activation on the end for a year.\r\nSo that's more like BIP 9, that's what we used to do.\r\nSee if miners activate it, just requiring a 95% hash power support threshold, let's see if they do it or not.\r\nIf they do it, great.\r\nSoft fork has been activated.\r\nIf they don't, then phase two of this proposal comes into play which is six months of developer reconsideration.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nSo developers see if there was a good reason for miners to block it.\r\nMaybe there was a problem with the proposal, in this case Taproot, that they hadn't considered before.\r\nSo developers are just going to sort of reconsider.\r\nIf after six months they haven't found anything wrong with the proposal and they conclude that, okay, it's actually just miner apathy or miners trying something or whatever, like no good reason, then we're going to deploy it again.\r\nThis time BIP 8 with either forced signaling or...\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nWith a flag day.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nFlag day on the end.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nI think Matt's original idea was flag day on the end, but he's probably open to forced signaling I would imagine.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nI mean, the question is if you have a flag day, what do you do on the flag day?\r\nAnd one thing you can do with the flag day is enforce the soft fork and the other is you can force the signaling, which then triggers the soft fork.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nWell, exactly.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nSo I don't think that's...\r\nThat's more of a detail and it's probably not controversial to force the signaling instead of forcing the soft fork.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nI think that wouldn't be very controversial.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nJust makes it more compatible with what other people are doing.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYes, exactly.\r\nSo that would probably be, yeah.\r\nOkay.\r\nSo that's one idea, it has the benefits of sort of taking it easy and reconsidering if there's maybe something wrong with the proposal.\r\nAnd if there is something wrong with the proposal that people don't have to actually need to upgrade their soft fork, they can just keep running whatever they were running.\r\nBecause there was a time out anyway in the soft fork, it just didn't happen.\r\nAnd it's sort of fine, there's no sort of emergency upgrades needed at all or anything like that.\r\nThe downside is that if miners don't cooperate, it's going to take a long time before the soft fork actually is live on the network, like three and a half years.\r\nSo that means App developers have to wait three and a half years.\r\nEveryone's just sort of stuck waiting for three and a half years for basically no good reason.\r\nSo that's why some people really don't like this proposal.\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nWell, you're going to think in the long run, right?\r\nSo it's nice if you can have these improvements ship very quickly.\r\nBut if there is a tradition that developers decide on a soft fork and it gets activated quickly, well then maybe a government starts calling developers and saying, \"Hey, we have this KYC soft fork.\r\nAnd since nobody really pays attention and miners are run anything you want, why don't you just make that soft fork and don't worry about the review process?\" So you don't want to put too much power in the hands of the developers.\r\nThey don't want that kind of power because it means they're going to get very unpleasant phone calls at some point.\r\nSo.\r\nIt's a difficult trade off, because on the time scale of 200 years, it really doesn't matter if the soft fork takes three years longer.\r\nBut we have no idea what the right time is, maybe it makes no difference for this political problem.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nIt might really just be wasting three years or it's really important to make sure there's no problem.\r\n[crosstalk 00:23:00].\r\nI'd like to see it deployed soon and hopefully miners are excited.\r\nBut it's going to get more and more difficult to deploy these things in general because if you get, and we want that, lots and lots of very small individual mining pools while trying to get 95%, even just to communicate to them is going to be harder.\r\nAnd that's a good thing, but it could slow things down.\r\nVery...\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nSure.\r\nSo another idea is BIP 8, let's say with like a year deadline at which time forced signaling happens.\r\nAlmost kind of like a basic proposal.\r\nWould this be...\r\nSo to first ask you about that, do you think that's too fast?\r\nOne year, forced signaling?\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nSo my problem with the forced signal is, if you ship this thing and you say, \"Okay, miners can signal for it.\r\nBut if they don't, it's going to activate.\" You kind of lock yourself into that outcome.\r\nThere's no real way to object anymore.\r\nBecause even if miners come up and say, \"Hey, wait a minute, there is a problem.\" Then you can't cancel it anymore, because people are this new soft fork and they have the forced signaling in.\r\nSo lots of people would see their nodes just stop.\r\nAnd so you're essentially having a hard fork if you decide to not do it.\r\nSo what I think you should do at minimum is say, \"We ship this version without the hard coded date in it, but we're probably going to enforce that hard coded date in a new upgrade.\" But I think that should be [crosstalk 00:24:27].\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYeah well, that's another proposal I want to get there next.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nOkay.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nBut I want to...\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nSo this one I don't like, because if you remove any ability to object, then why even bother with the miner signaling.\r\nBecause once you put a flag date in the code and you ship that code, that's it.\r\nIt's just going to activate.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nWell the idea behind any soft fork-\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nUnless you force people to upgrade and that's a hard fork.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\nAlthough the idea behind any soft fork including Taproot presumably, is that there shouldn't be a problem with it if it's going to be shipped at all.\r\nLike at the point of it being shipped, there shouldn't be any problems with it.\r\nAnd after that, it's just a matter of coordinating the upgrade.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nBut the question is when are people going to bother to review it?\r\nAnd I could imagine that if I'm a miner and like, \"Oh, I have to run this new version, let's see what it's doing.\"\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nRight.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\n\"Holy shit.\r\nI don't like these new rules.\r\nWhy are they reducing the block reward?\"\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nRight.\r\nThat's one of Matt's arguments as well.\r\nThat people and miners will only really consider it when the code is out there and the software is out there.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nAnd it's an expensive signal too, right?\r\nAs a developer, you're really shipping this software.\r\nThat's a bigger commitment than saying, \"Okay, looks good and get up.\"\r\nSo I think that is a critical moment and you can't expect review to happen after that.\r\nOr review to happen after that.\r\nSo that's why I don't think you should put the date in stone, at least not the first try.\r\nMaybe a half a year later.\r\nMaybe you don't have to wait for the whole year.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nSo a related idea and it's almost kind of the same idea I guess, but it's Luke-Jr.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nLuke Dashjr.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\nLuke Dashjr, Luke-Jr.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nPeople call him Luke-Jr.\r\nBut he once said in a podcast, \"It's Luke Dashjr.\" So.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nOh, he did?\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\nThe Peter McCormack show.\r\nThat's the first time I learned.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nAll right.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nMaybe he's lying.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nOh no.\r\nHe's not allowed to lie according to his religion.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nOkay.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nHe likes BIP 8 with forced signaling towards the end, but he prefers it to be deployed in forks for clients.\r\nSo not in Bitcoin core.\r\nSo kind of like BIP 148.\r\nLike he thinks soft fork activation should happen through different clients.\r\nThat sort of takes away this pressure on Bitcoin core developers.\r\nLike potential government forced soft forks, that sort of stuff.\r\nSo only do it through forks of Bitcoin core, or forks clients.\r\nWhat do you think of that idea?\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nWell, how do you coordinate the date?\r\nIs that-\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nSomeone just picks one or it's sort of coordinated in some slack channel, like what happened with BIP 148, or...\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nThe problem is, like we discussed before.\r\nIf you have multiple dates, you're going to get the cowboy bias.\r\nBecause whoever picks the most aggressive date, that's the party you kind of have to listen to.\r\nBut that might be a recklessly early date, because some people might be [crosstalk 00:27:18].\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nI think if...\r\nSo, like we mentioned before with the kosher food, a soft forks shouldn't have any downsides really, or at least that's when it's becoming-\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nBut a fast activation could still cause problems.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYes.\r\nBut then that's the downside in itself.\r\nSo if people in general think, \"Okay, this is too aggressive.\r\nLike this isn't good for Bitcoin to do this aggressively.\" Then that's the reason itself, I think, it might fail.\r\nSo there's-\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nBut the problem with this is the minority rule.\r\nThe intransigent minority rule that Taleb likes to talk about.\r\nThe most fanatic group.\r\nSo probably the most fanatic group is going to say the earliest date, and the rest will have to just go along with that earliest date.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nNo they don't.\r\nNot if the rest really dislikes the solution.\r\nThe only reason it works with sodas is because most people don't care either way.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nRight.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nBut if most people really cared about what was in their soda, then the minority wouldn't get their way necessary.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nI would prefer if you went this route and there's some merit to it.\r\nI would still like at least the development community, like people on the mailing list to agree on a date.\r\nAnd then once that date is agreed on, we say, \"Okay, we're not going to endorse this thing, but if you do this thing, here's the download and we all have the same date in mind.\r\nSo there's no chaos around the date.\"\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nAnd then...\r\nYeah, there is something to be said for like not having-\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nBut they don't seem to agree, so that's going to be tricky as well.\r\nRight?\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nWho doesn't agree?\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nWell, I think for example, Luke.\r\nI think also Jeremy Rubin to name a few names.\r\nThey'd like a much faster activation date than for example Matt Corallo, or I think AJ Towns is also someone who prefers a slower activation date.\r\nSo there's dispute in there it seems.\r\nSo that makes it kind of tricky, right?\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\nIt may be that that ends up in something that will forever be known as the Bike Shed Wars.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nWell, but then, the cowboy might actually come around and...\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\nAnd activate-\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nAnd almost sort of save the day.\r\nI'm not necessarily endorsing that, but-\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nBut let me give you a bad scenario-\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nLet me put it this way Sjors.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nOkay.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nI find it almost inevitable, like someone out there is going to Leroy Jenkins.\r\nLike it's got to happen.\r\nI don't know if it's going to succeed, but it's almost inevitable.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nSo here's a bad scenario.\r\nLet's say we ship the completely ready Taproot code ready for main net in two months.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nNot going to happen, but let's say we do that.\r\nAnd the code has this one year miner signaling thing and then it expires.\r\nAnd now the most aggressive group comes out and says, \"No, no, no, we're going to activate this like one month later.\" That's going to be the consensus of the loudest people.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYes.\r\nThat's going to be the Leroy Jenkins.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nSo two weeks into that scheme, the miners actually start reviewing.\r\nBecause like we just talked about, people might only review code when it's ready.\r\nNow they find a critical bug.\r\nAnd most of the core developers would agree, \"Okay, this is actually a bug.\r\nWe should abort.\r\nSoft fork miners, please don't signal for it.\"\r\nBut at the same time you have this super loud group, who's already canceled everybody who doesn't agree with them to activate this thing.\r\nSo that's why I like the idea of having at least some decent amount of time and some community agreement on, \"When are we going to flag date this thing?\" And it shouldn't be within a few months.\r\nYou should give people a decent amount of time.\r\nBut you know, I can't decide what people are going to do.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nWell, I said, that's kind of my point.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nBut you might get a...\r\nEither that might be successful and it just deploys early and we get lucky.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nMaybe it's a botched UASF sort of situation where they try.\r\nThey make a really loud noise.\r\nBut the main players in the industry, because of this bug for example, say, \"No, no, no.\r\nWe're not doing this.\"\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nAnd they just collide head on and nothing happens, where you get a bunch of orphan blocks.\r\nIt's hard to predict.\r\nBut that could be a mess and that could be on CNN.\r\nAnd then there's like, \"Oh, Bitcoin is broken,\" on CNN.\r\nAnd Bitcoin was already broken two podcasts ago.\r\nRemember?\r\nI don't know what the topic was.\r\nI think at was about [crosstalk 00:31:20].\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nNo, that was a security something....\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nOh, it was unconfirmed transactions.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nOh yeah.\r\nThat was the thing.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nBut now imagine all these very mediagenic people with their machine guns in the forest advocating a soft fork that all of the core developers are saying, \"Let's not activate this, because there's like a really, really bad bug in it.\"\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYes.\r\nBut I do think the dynamics then would be very different.\r\nLike if there's an actual bug in the actual soft fork itself, compared to an actual...\r\nOr just an objection to that situation itself.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nRight.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nLike these are two different-\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nThis was a very extreme example.\r\nBut less extreme would be, I think miners should have some time to review this code after it's shipped.\r\nAnd some people might say, \"No, they should have reviewed it earlier, because like we don't want to set the incentive.\"\r\nI think it could be messy.\r\nSo that's why waiting longer, I think is just better.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nSo here's another right idea.\r\nAnother idea is BIP 8 plus BIP 91.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nOkay.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nSo this basically means you're going to deploy BIP 8, I think with a long signaling period.\r\nLike could even be three years or whatever, like something that's similar to Matt's proposal.\r\nAfter these three years, three and a half, whatever it is, the activation is triggered.\r\nSo there's a long lead up.\r\nIn the meantime though, you're going to see what happens.\r\nSo for example, if after a year it's still not activated, then developers can sort of try to find out why it hasn't activated again, sort of similar to Matt's idea.\r\nDevelopers take their time.\r\nThey figure out, \"Okay, there's actually no good reason that it's not being X failed.\" At that point, they can deploy a new client that has sort of BIP 91 in it, which forces miners to signal support for it before the three and a half year are over.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nYou mean a lower threshold?\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYes.\r\nA lower threshold.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nOkay.\r\nSo you basically ship an update, which has a lower threshold in it.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYes, which in turn triggers the higher threshold.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nSo I like the idea of lowering the threshold over time.\r\nWhat I am worried about, and maybe that was discussed, is what if there's a bug?\r\nBecause if this thing has a three year window, that means there is three years in which this thing could activate, even though everybody agrees, it shouldn't activate.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nRight.\r\nWell then, so that's-\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nThat's kind of scary.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nRight.\r\nSo then the answer is deploy a new client that includes a soft fork that undoes the Taproot soft fork in that case.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nWell, if you undo a soft fork, it's a hard fork.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nNot if it's not activated yet.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nBut you don't know that.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean?\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nThe problem is people who are running the first version, they're just waiting for that 95%.\r\nThey're waiting for three years until this thing activates.\r\nBut then if there's a bug fix, then you need to have a new signal flag to indicate the new version of Taproot that you're going to activate.\r\nAnd you have to make sure the old version never activates, because [crosstalk 00:34:27].\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nSoft fork is a tightening of the rules.\r\nSo now you say any soft fork, any Taproot, anything is just not allowed.\r\nYou're not going to include it in blocks.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nYeah.\r\nYou could completely ban version one basically.\r\nRight.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nThat would be soft fork.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nBut that's pretty horrific.\r\nIt would be nice if you didn't have to do that.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nIt would be kind of ugly.\r\nYes.\r\nPlus it would be important that people upgrade.\r\n[crosstalk 00:34:50].\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nSo a one year signaling thing is nice, because that means that you can say, \"Okay, if this thing doesn't activate in a year because there's a bug.\r\nWe wait a year and we try again and then we know for sure we're not going to accidentally activate the old version after that year.\"\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, it's kind of annoying to have to wait for a year.\r\nBut then if there really is a bug in a thing that was ready to be deployed, that really warrants a year of thinking really, really well about how the hell that could happen.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nOkay.\r\nSo then there was another idea.\r\nI added this, as an-\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nBut the idea of saying that signaling thresholds could go down, that makes sense to me.\r\nSo you could say, \"Well, when the year starts, it's 95%.\r\nBut you know, after six months it should just be 80%.\r\nAnd after 11 months it should be a little bit less.\r\nAnd then if it still doesn't happen, we give up and we decide again for next year, what we're going to do.\"\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYes.\r\nAll right.\r\nSo then there was another idea which is, I guess, is it the opposite as a previous one?\r\nMaybe not.\r\nYou take BIP 8 with a long period, but without forced signaling at the end.\r\nThen you still keep an eye on what's happening.\r\nIf after a while you find that there is no problem with it, but miners aren't signaling for it because they're just apathetic or they have another bad reason.\r\nThen you can deploy another client with BIP 8, this time with forced signaling that starts forced signaling before the end of the current signaling period.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nOkay.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nOr at least not later than that.\r\nLike if it starts before that, then you have two groups of nodes online on the network, the BIP 8 nodes you deployed first that don't have forced signaling on the end.\r\nAnd now the new group of BIP 8 nodes that do have forced signaling.\r\nSo if they do so the forced signaling stuff, then the older BIP 8 nodes will also accept that as an upgrade.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nOh, well that sounds like a regular idea of BIP 8.\r\nRight.\r\nSo BIP 8 has the option to allow soft fork signaling.\r\nSo initially you do not ship that option, and then later on you do ship the option.\r\nAnd yeah, the old nodes won't be confused, because they see the signaling.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYep.\r\nPretty much.\r\nSo what's your preference here?\r\nIt sounds like you're kind of conservative.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nWell, like I said, I don't like the idea of hard coding a flag date initially.\r\nSo I can see the benefit of, you ship something, you wait.\r\nSay it has a year of a window.\r\nYou wait for six months and then you still don't see any signaling, but you also don't see the miners that reviewed your code and found problems.\r\nThen maybe you say, \"Okay, let's do a flag date.\" So it's like, \"That's not super patient.\" And then you ship, you have that flag date within six months.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nBut I'm not sure.\r\nIn the short run it's nice to have all this stuff fast.\r\nIn the long run it's kind of scary if something can happen fast.\r\nBecause it gives you less time to stop it if it's bad.\r\nBut again, just being slow for the sake of being slow, doesn't make any sense either.\r\nSo I can see why these IRC threads are going to be really long.\r\nBut what I'm hoping will happen is, we just do BIP 8 without a flag date with a year of a window, and we get lucky and miners just activate the thing within a month.\r\nAnd it's done.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nThat would be nice, right.\r\nIf miners just cooperate and maybe we're all making too big of a problem out of this.\r\nWell, that's one of the...\r\nJust for example like Greg-\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nWell, I don't want to say it would be nice if miners just cooperated, because Ethereum has that too and miners are very cooperative.\r\nI would, [crosstalk 00:38:26], if miners were very excited about this proposal for good reasons and did so quickly.\r\nBut I'm not saying that it's not technically not cooperation, it's just agreeing, right.\r\nNot obeying.\r\nI guess it is cooperating, but I mean it in an agreement sense, not in an obeying sense.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nSure.\r\nWell I think Greg Maxwell's position, for example, there are few like him.\r\nIs I don't think he really cares strongly, like he feels like whatever is likely to work.\r\nLike just go for it.\r\nDon't overthink this, because-\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nIt's probably a good...\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\n\"If it doesn't work out, we'll deal with it then.\" I think that's sort of his position, for example.\r\nAnd like all of the options I've named so far, I think he's sort of okay with.\r\nAs long as, like something needs to be picked.\r\nBecause the longer it's going to take, the harder it's going to get probably, and the more controversial the whole topic might become.\r\nAnd like just try something.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nYeah, it's quite possible.\r\nYou get a whole holy war over the exact details of how you activate a soft fork and that might be bad.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nDo you think it's...\r\nI mean, that's one of the reasons it could be like a holy war, is some people think that it's a very important precedent to like the way you're enforcing a soft fork.\r\nThe way you're activating a soft fork that really matters going forward for the next soft fork.\r\nAnd it really sort of defines Bitcoin almost in a way.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nWell, I don't know about the latter because things change.\r\nSo even if we do things in an amazing way, five years from now, there might be a whole new generation of people that just do not care about the ways of five years ago.\r\nAll these old people.\r\nSo.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nEspecially in Bitcoin, five years is an eternity.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nI mean, I think that I mentioned today my main concerns, don't set something in stone that you have a serious chance of regretting.\r\nSo keep in mind that people don't review code before it's actually shipped.\r\nAnd so that's why I kind of like the idea of having say a one year activation window.\r\nMaybe with a minimum of three months, there was another proposal for that.\r\nAnd then give miners and others some time to actually review this thing, because haven't done it.\r\nAnd then if they find a problem, you could still abort.\r\nAnd then if you don't see this objection, then you can choose to put in a flag day and then you can debate whether you want the flag day to be very quickly at the end of the year.\r\nOr whether you say let's give it another year.\r\nThat just depends.\r\nBut I don't have a strong opinion there.\r\nBut I'm not the most patient person, so you should ask a more patient person.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nWell, you sound pretty patient to me.\r\nI think I'm pretty patient.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nNot by like Greg Maxwell standards, I think.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nRight.\r\nI guess I'm pretty patient when it comes to soft forks and I'm not really in a rush.\r\nLike Bitcoin works for me the way it's working.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nA downside of having-\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it's like users are, \"It's not up to me.\" Like people are going to get impatient and I think that's going to be an interesting dynamic to see play out.\r\nLike too conservative is a risk in itself.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nYes.\r\nBecause if this soft fork is hanging in the air for years, it will get political.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nAnd then it might not go through because of politics.\r\nThat would not have happened if it went through a bit quicker.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nYes.\r\nOr it just increases the chance that someone's going to Leroy Jenkins in a bad way.\r\nIf developers want to be too conservative, then you're going to see that kind of movement.\r\nAnd that might not always be the best way to do it either.\r\nI think this is a fascinating topic and I'm going to...\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nShould we end on the cliffhanger?\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nDo you have a cliff hanger?\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nWhat are sporks?\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nWhat's that?\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nWhat a sporks?\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nOh, sporks.\r\nYou want to get into that one as well?\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nNo, no.\r\nI want to leave it as a cliff hanger.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nOh yeah.\r\nThat's even better.\r\nSo we discussed it in another episode?\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nIn another episode or maybe never.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nI like that.\r\nYeah.\r\nMaybe never.\r\nMaybe we're doing a lost cliffhanger.\r\nYou'll just never get the answer.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nSo.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nBut there is another idea for soft fork, which is called sporks.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nSporks.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nRight Sjors.\r\nThat was it for this episode I think.\r\n\r\nSjors Provoost:\r\n\r\nThank you For listening to the Van Wirdum Sjorsnado.\r\n\r\nAaron van Wirdum:\r\n\r\nThere we go.\r\n\n",

    "summary": "In a recent podcast episode, Sjors Provoost and Aaron van Wirdum embarked on a deep dive into the Bitcoin soft fork activation process, beginning with an analogy that likens this process to kosher food regulations to illustrate the backward compatibility of soft forks. They explored the historical context of soft fork activations, including Satoshi Nakamoto's initial discreet method and the evolution towards miner signaling mechanisms like BIP 9, which was designed to ensure network readiness before activating new rules. However, the SegWit activation saga revealed significant flaws in relying solely on miner signaling, leading to a broader discussion within the community about finding more resilient and inclusive activation strategies.\n\nThe conversation transitioned to innovative approaches such as BIP 8, which proposes a flexible mechanism for activating soft forks that includes adjustments to the signaling threshold and a \"flag date\" to enforce signaling if necessary. This method aims to streamline the activation process and circumvent previous pitfalls by fostering community consensus on critical dates to prevent network fragmentation. Despite these advancements, challenges such as miner apathy and achieving widespread consensus on flag dates underscore the ongoing struggle to balance technical needs with community dynamics.\n\nA further layer of complexity is added by the discussion of extended timelines for soft fork activation, highlighting the tension between rapid technological advancement and the preservation of decentralized governance. Provoost raised concerns about the risks of excessive developer authority and the potential for contentious updates to be pushed without thorough community review. This underscores the importance of a balanced approach to innovation that considers both the long-term vision of Bitcoin and the immediate needs of its users and developers.\n\nAs the dialogue between Provoost and van Wirdum unfolded, they touched upon various strategies to navigate the challenges of coordinating soft fork activations in a decentralized environment. They discussed the idea of deploying soft forks through client forks to alleviate pressure on Bitcoin Core developers and reduce centralization risks. This approach, however, introduces its own set of coordination challenges, particularly regarding agreement on specific activation dates.\n\nIn closing, their discussion emphasized the delicacy required in managing soft fork activations within the Bitcoin ecosystem. They highlighted the need for flexibility, experimentation, and a cautious yet decisive approach to avoid politicizing technological upgrades or rushing into contentious actions. The conversation concluded with a tantalizing mention of sporks, an alternative soft fork implementation concept, leaving listeners curious about future discussions on this topic.\n\nThrough their comprehensive exploration, Provoost and van Wirdum provided valuable insights into the nuanced considerations involved in soft fork activation, underscoring the inherent tension between innovation and stability, and the critical role of community consensus in shaping the future of Bitcoin's protocol. Their dialogue serves as a reminder of the ongoing efforts required to ensure the security, reliability, and sustainable growth of the Bitcoin network amidst an ever-evolving landscape of technological development and governance challenges."
