discuss is open timestamps.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:00:53\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:00:53\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Right?\\nAnd we'll get to the reason why it's relevant later.\\nOr do you want to get into that now?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:00:58\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Well, we can say that something was timestamped.\\nThat was at least mentioned in the news.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:01:04\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah.\\nYeah.\\nSo it's these emails by Hunter Biden, or he received emails.\\nThat's actually the story.\\nYeah.\\nThrough timestamps, we can be sure that these emails were in fact sent a couple years ago and they were signed with Google's\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:01:20\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"keys.\\nExactly.\\nWas that term again?\\nYeah, they were sent between two Gmail addresses and Google signs email.\\nSo we know that Google signed that email and if they don't lie about the timestamps, which I don't think Google does, we know those emails are real.\\nWhat they mean is a different question, but we know they're real.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:01:36\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes, and thanks to OpenTimestamps, we know that the emails were really sent.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:01:40\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Actually, thanks to OpenTimestamps, we know less than that, but we can get into that.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:01:45\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Okay, let's get into OpenTimestamps then.\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"Open Timestamps\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:01:47\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So OpenTimestamps, it's a project by Peter Todd, former Bitcoin Core contributor.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:01:52\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"He likes to call himself a former Bitcoin Core contributor.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:01:56\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes, and applied cryptographer consultant.\\nThat's what he calls himself.\\nOkay.\\nSo do you want to explain what it is?\\nOpen timestamps?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:02:05\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Well it's basically a way to prove that a given document exists, existed before a certain time.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:02:13\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah, before or at a certain time I guess.\\nYeah, well if you\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:02:18\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"add one second then you can\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:02:19\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"make it before.\\nSure, exactly.\\nSure, fair enough.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:02:21\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"But the idea is you can, you know, you use the Bitcoin blockchain for this because Bitcoin blocks, we know when they were created, roughly, not to the second, but we know roughly when they were created.\\nAnd so if the Bitcoin blockchain points to a document, and I say points to in quotes, that means that document must have existed before that part of the blockchain was created.\\nAnd that's kind of what OpenTimestamp leverages.\\nOf course, we don't actually put documents in the blockchain, that would be bad.\\nWe put timestamps in the documents, in the blockchain.\\nAnd these timestamps are a hash of the document, or they are a hash of multiple documents.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:02:59\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"There are actual documents in the blockchain, aren't there?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:03:02\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"That's correct.\\nSo that's the worst way you can do this.\\nYou can put the actual document in the blockchain and then you can prove that that document existed, you know, very long ago and some people were doing that back in 2011.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:03:16\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah, for example, the Bitcoin white paper, I think, is in the blockchain, right?\\nIt could be.\\nI think so.\\nBut anyway, so there's a better way of doing this.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:03:24\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes, because a document can be hashed.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:03:28\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes, so what's a hash?\\nIs that too much for our audience?\\nDo they already understand that you think?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:03:36\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"No, it's good to remind people.\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"What Is a Hash\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:03:37\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Okay, let's get it.\\nWhat is a hash?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:03:39\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"We can teach them something.\\nThe Dutch word for hash is verhospeling.\\nNot that anyone would ever use that word.\\nBut it is basically a mangled version of the document.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:03:48\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Why did you mention that?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:03:50\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Because we want to educate our users.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:03:52\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"We want to teach them Dutch?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:03:53\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:03:54\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"For the hospital.\\nYou taught me something, I didn't know that.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:03:57\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Well, yeah, because nobody would use that.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:03:59\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Right.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:04:00\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So the idea is that you take any given text and you mangle it in a way that you get just a number Or you know, it looks like a bunch of letters, but it's just a big number.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:04:11\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah.\\nWell, it's a hexadecimal number, right?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:04:14\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Well a number is a number but you can write a number as a hexadecimal.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:04:17\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Exactly.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:04:17\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So the key there is that if you change one letter in the text, the hash changes.\\nAnd so a good hash function is something that takes any text and produces a unique number and does not collide.\\nSo you cannot come up with two different tags that produce the same number.\\nRight.\\nNow that's of course impossible to actually prove, but the wizards came up with, for example, SHA-256, and so far it seems to work.\\nAnd the nice thing is the Bitcoin blockchain keeps producing blocks, and there's a pretty big incentive to find a duplicate.\\nSo if there is a vulnerability in SHA256 where you could take, you could change the contents of a block and still have the same proof of work, That would be bad, but we'll find out soon enough.\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"Benefits of a Hash\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:05:03\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah, so I guess the benefits of a hash I would describe as you can, if you have a hash of a document and you have the document, then you can prove that the hash of the document is in fact the hash of the document, because every time you hash the document, the same hash comes out.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:05:19\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"That's right.\\nAnd the\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:05:20\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"other benefit is that a hash is very small compared to the document.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:05:24\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"That's also right.\\nOr at\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:05:24\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"least it can be very small.\\nSo you can have, I don't know, an entire book, and you produce a hash of it, then you just have one string of numbers.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:05:32\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Exactly.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:05:33\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So now you can prove that the book is the same thing as the hash.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:05:37\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah, and this can be useful for very practical stuff like if you have optical character recognition, so you're scanning a book and you want to make sure that the scan is correct, or maybe you have a checksum, which is also a hash.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:05:50\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Right.\\nOkay.\\nSo that's what a hash is.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:05:52\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:05:52\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Do we cover hashes?\\nYeah.\\nI think so.\"}, {\"type\":\"heading\",\"text\":\"Miracle Tree\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:05:55\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Now, something we discussed last week is a Merkle tree.\\nHow about I explain the Merkle tree this time?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:06:01\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Sounds good.\\nGo ahead.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:06:01\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"And then people can tell us who did a better job.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:06:04\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"All\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:06:04\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"right.\\nOkay, so we're hashing documents.\\nWe just explained how we're hashing documents.\\nNow we have, let's say we have two documents.\\nEach of them we turn into a hash.\\nSo now we have two hashes.\\nNow we take the two hashes and we combine these and turn them into a new hash.\\nSo now we have one hash again.\\nNow we have two more documents.\\nWe hash these documents as well.\\nWe have two hashes.\\nThese two hashes we hash again.\\nSo now in total we still have two hashes.\\nWe hash these hashes together and now once again we have one hash.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:06:40\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"One hash that represents all these four documents.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:06:42\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes, one hash that includes all four.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:06:44\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"And This looks like a pyramid, but we call it a tree.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:06:49\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes, it's a reverse tree.\\nIt's a pyramid.\\nYeah, you're right.\\nThat's what a Merkle tree is.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:06:54\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So why do we care about Merkle trees?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:06:56\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"The nice thing about the Merkle tree is that if you have one of the documents that's included in the Merkle tree, you should be able to prove that it is in the Merkle tree to someone who only has the Merkle hash, which was the last hash we ended up with.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:07:14\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Exactly.\\nAnd they also don't need to know every document in the Merkle tree.\\nSo you can reveal one document in the Merkle tree.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:07:21\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Right.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:07:22\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"By, you know, revealing the right hashes.\\nBasically one at every level of the tree.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:07:26\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes, which is called a Merkle root.\\nOr Merkle proof.\\nOh, sorry.\\nMerkle proof.\\nSo yeah, okay.\\nOkay.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:07:33\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So why do we care about this?\\nInstead of putting the whole document inside the blockchain in the transaction, we can put a hash of a document in a transaction.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:07:42\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Right, which is much more compact, much smaller, and therefore requires less block space and less fees.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:07:47\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Exactly.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:07:47\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So that's better.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:07:48\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"And there's a nice way to do that.\\nThis is called OP return, which we discussed, I believe in a previous episode.\\nIt basically tells the node, like everything after this, you can ignore.\\nYou don't have to put this in your UTXO set, which we talked about last episode, takes up RAM.\\nSo you write OP return in the destination of your payment, and then it's followed by the hash.\\nAnd then some other software will have to interpret that.\\nRight.\\nBut it's still a bit inefficient, right?\\nAnd that's why we're talking about this Merkle tree.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:08:14\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah, you don't want to have to create a transaction for each document you want to include in a blockchain because there's a better way and that's including the Merkle root.\\nThat's right.\\nI'm confused about terms can you\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:08:26\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"hear?\\nSo the Merkle root is the top of the tree yes or the top of the roots or the bottom of the upside down tree, depending on how you want to look at it.\\nAnd the Merkle proof is a way to say that this given document actually is part of that tree without having to reveal the entire tree, but just bits of the tree.\\nSo how do you use this in practice is the question because you might just have one document that you want to timestamp but you don't want to create a transaction for that, but what if people could come together and Yeah, basically have a whole bunch of documents maybe once a day or once an hour, timestamped.\\nAnd that is where the calendar server comes out.\\nSo this is a super centralized solution, but that doesn't really matter.\\nAnd we'll explain why that doesn't matter.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:09:14\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"It's a server run by Peter Todd in this case, right?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:09:17\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"It could be, we don't know, but that's what he says.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:09:19\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I trust Peter, don't you?\\nI trust Peter to run this server.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:09:24\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"We don't have to.\\nThat's even better.\\nYes.\\nOkay, so what this calendar server does is basically everybody keeps sending documents to it or actually hashes of documents to it of course not the actual document that would be bad and the server basically waits one second and then tells you at the end of that second you know if you were the only hash or if there were other people who submitted something in that second, and it gives you a hash back.\\nAnd you then need to call that server again a while later to say, hey, has this thing been included in the block yet?\\nBecause every couple hours, it will take all these hashes and make a Merkle tree out of that and put that on the blockchain inside a transaction.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:10:05\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So what the server is returning to you immediately is a hash of the document itself?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:10:10\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I think the server immediately returns either a timestamp or maybe the hash of every other document it perceived.\\nNo, probably, I guess a timestamp.\\nI haven't looked at the implementation, but the idea is that it groups everybody into seconds, so you never have to wait for more than a second.\\nAnd then at some point, multiple seconds worth of transactions, multiple seconds worth of documents are put into a single transaction, which is confirmed in a chain.\\nAnd then the server will actually give you the whole chain of evidence you need to go from the document you submitted to that transaction and the block.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:10:45\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Okay, so that last part doesn't happen immediately.\\nThat last part telling you where to find it in the tree, that only happens when it's included in a transaction.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:10:53\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Well, it has to, right?\\nAnd included in a block, because you don't know what block it's going to be in when you make the transaction.\\nBut you don't even know what the transaction is going to look like because there's more documents coming in.\\nSo the hash keeps changing.\\nThe hash that goes into the transaction keeps changing as new documents go to this calendar server.\\nBut eventually, at some point, everything it's got so far goes into a transaction, it gets confirmed, and now it has that proof.\\nSo this is where it can be, you know, where you temporarily have to trust it.\\nBut you can see if it's not doing what it's supposed to do.\\nIt could just decide to throw away your document and never include it.\\nBut once it has done that, you don't need it anymore, because you get all the evidence yourself and you can keep it.\\nAnd if they somehow censor you, then you just run your own server.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:11:42\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Okay, so if I understand correctly, Everyone's sending in documents they want to have hashed, or do they send in the hashes themselves?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:11:49\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"They send in the hashes.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:11:50\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Okay, so everyone sends in hashes of documents they want to have timestamped.\\nOnce a second, Peter Todd returns, or well, the calendar server, whoever operates it, returns either a hash of the document, if there was only one document that second.\\nOr no, in that case, what do you get back because you're already sending in a hash?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:12:11\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I guess it'll just give you the hash back.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:12:13\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Okay, so...\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:12:13\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"I haven't read the exact code, but this is probably how it roughly works.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:12:17\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah, it's a bit of an implementation detail anyway.\\nSo you send in the hash of the document you want to have timestamped.\\nOnce a second, a hash is returned, which is either then I guess that hash, or if multiple people send in documents, or if there were multiple hashes of documents sent in in the same second, then a Merkle root is returned plus a Merkle path, which lets you find your hash in the tree.\\nExactly.\\nIt's like a miniature tree for once a second.\\nEvery second, there's a miniature tree.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:12:51\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"And this just prevents you from flooding the server with millions of hashes and it having to hold on to that for years.\\nNow, whatever you throw at it in one second, it can forget after one second.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:13:02\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Right.\\nNow, all of these miniature trees, to call them that, these are all sort of accumulated and turned into a new Merkle tree.\\nAnd the Merkle root of that tree is once a while included in a Bitcoin transaction.\\nAt that point, all of the documents are basically time-stamped in the Bitcoin blockchain.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:13:22\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes, but you still don't have the proof.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:13:24\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes, and that proof is also sent to you by the server.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:13:27\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"No, no, no.\\nThe server, you know, it's not, don't call us, we call you.\\nIt's the opposite.\\nYou have to call the server.\\nSo you basically, every now and then, I think there's a way that you can just wait for it if you have a patient computer, but you can also pull it later and say, hey, do you have the full proof of me now?\\nAnd at that point, it will give you everything you need.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:13:47\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Right, okay.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:13:48\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So which to go back is basically you started your document that you gave the hash.\\nAnd then the whatever hashes of all the documents in that one second, and then whatever transaction it comes in, and then where that is in the block.\\nRight.\\nThat's pretty much the proof.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:14:06\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"All right, so now we've included a document or the hash of a document in the Bitcoin blockchain through this miracle trick.\\nNow we want to prove to someone later on, it's a year later, we want to prove to someone that a year ago we included this hash into the Bitcoin blockchain.\\nHow do we do that?\\nHow do we prove it?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:14:24\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Right.\\nSo first you give that person the actual document, and then you give them this OTS file, which contains the proof.\\nBasically all these these Merkle proofs that we stored before.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:14:36\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Right and then what does that person do with that?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:14:39\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"They run a command called OTS verify which basically checks the proof so it checks whether all the hashes are what they say they should be.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:14:46\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"And then\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:14:47\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"it checks against your own node whether the transaction is included in the blockchain.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:14:52\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So that requires them to have the OpenTimestamp software, right?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:14:56\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"That's right.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:14:56\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"And the OpenTimestamp software uses the Bitcoin blockchain that you have on your node to check if it's really in there.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:15:02\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Exactly.\\nAnd so it does not need any of these calendar services.\\nSo these are just necessary to store proof, but they can disappear off the face of the earth as long as you keep the file with the proof.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:15:12\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Right.\\nSo now in recent weeks we discussed all sorts of pruning tricks, these kinds of things.\\nWhat if you're running a pruned node?\\nCan you still check the blockchain somehow?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:15:22\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes, because the nice thing is that you can prove that a transaction exists in a block without keeping the whole block.\\nYou can just basically provide a Merkle proof that the transaction actually occurs in the block.\\nRight.\\nAnd therefore the only thing you need is the block header.\\nAnd yeah, you still have that.\\nIf you prune everything, you don't prune the headers.\\nNice.\\nSo you have a nice chain of evidence.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:15:43\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Okay, so let's get to the reason why we're discussing all of this, Jors.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:15:46\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Exactly.\\nSo basically there was an email, let's say Alice was asking Bob for coffee.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:15:53\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"You don't want to trigger anyone so we're just gonna use Alice and Bob.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:15:57\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Also don't know the name of the sender.\\nLet's say Alice was asking Bob for a coffee back in 2015.\\nAnd

00:24:39\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah, interesting.\\nOkay, more cool stuff.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:24:42\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Another cool thing is actually the opposite.\\nThe Genesis block timestamps the times.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:24:48\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah, the newspaper, sure.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:24:49\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"But actually it's, you know, in practice more like the other way around, right?\\nThe fact that the times occurs in the Bitcoin blockchain, that times article from January 3rd, 2009, The fact that that occurs in the blockchain means that the blockchain must be more recent than that.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:25:06\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes, well the Genesis block at least, yes.\\nWell, so I guess the whole blockchain, sure.\"},

{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yes.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:25:13\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"So that's a nice example of how timestamps in the real world,

general claim is that you can limit the scope of fraud I believe that's how Peter thought phrased it so you cannot necessarily prevent all forms of fraud as we discussed it could be really funky

recently created by a Russian hacker.\\nNo, we know it was out there in 2016.\\nSo there's certain things you can no longer claim based on these timestamps.\\nAnd as we described with the example of the hypothetical evil Bitcoin Core maintainer that changes history, you can then prove that there are two versions of history, and that is something they would have to think\"},

one more cool thing before we end this podcast.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:27:24\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"All right, tell\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:27:24\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"me.\\nI think one of the nice things about Open Timestamps is that it actually resembles the idea that is mentioned in the white paper in the Bitcoin white paper the Scott Stornetta and Stuart Haber if I'm recalling these names correctly they had their own idea for timestamping back in the I think it was either the late 80s or the early 90s.\\nAnd back then, Stornetta's idea, his concern was that, as long as we have paper documents, then forging paper documents, is at least kind of difficult.\\nIt's at least sort of like it leaves traces or you can sort of tell that something has been doctored with or messed with, or it's at least sort of possible while if we're moving.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:28:11\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"And you know how old paper is.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:28:13\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Yeah, you can even tell how old paper is in many cases, or at least roughly.\\nAnd if we're moving to a digital world, that kind of stuff becomes completely impossible and every document can be altered in ways that are just unseeable.\\nSo He wanted to solve that problem and he and Heber, they tried to solve this problem.\\nThey couldn't figure out how to solve this problem because every solution they come up with relied on some kind of third party to vouch that a document existed at a certain point in time.\\nAnd maybe that third party would be checked by another, by fourth party, but there was always some trust involved, and that's what I want to get rid of.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:28:59\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Right, and That sounds pretty problematic in the Stalin example you just mentioned.\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 0: 00:29:03\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Exactly, yes.\\nSo, ultimately, they thought they were not going to be able to solve this problem, and then they wanted to at least prove that this was an unsolvable problem.\\nBut then while trying to prove that it was unsolvable, they came to the realization that, wait a minute, this is actually solvable if everyone in the world is party of the timestamping process.\\nSo everyone in the world submits their hashes and everyone in this world receives the combined hashes in return.\\nThat way, if you want to forge history, you would have to corrupt everyone or it would be obvious to everyone, like No one's going to go along with that.\\nThat was their solution, and this solution, I think, evolved.\\nUltimately, they came up with this idea of including the Merkle route into newspapers.\\nThen there was a Merkle route in the New York Times of May 22nd, 1996.\\nSo you knew that documents existed back then.\\nYep.\\nAnd ultimately, their ideas were inspiration for Satoshi Nakamoto.\\nIt was included in the Bitcoin white paper.\\nAnd that's interesting because now peter toss came up with a solution to actually implement a very similar solution into bitcoin so we've sort of gone full circle\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"Speaker 1: 00:30:26\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"yeah it's great because everybody wants the bitcoin

going to tell you who to vote for, even though this will be released after the election.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:00:26\n\nThis is our election special that's going to be published three days after the

later.\nOr do you want to get into that now?\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:00:58\n\nWell, we can say that something was timestamped.\nThat was at least mentioned in the news.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:01:04\n\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo it's these emails by Hunter Biden, or he received emails.\nThat's actually the story.\nYeah.\nThrough timestamps, we can be sure that these emails were in fact sent a couple years ago and they were signed with Google's\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:01:20\n\nkeys.\nExactly.\nWas that term again?\nYeah, they were sent between two Gmail addresses and Google signs email.\nSo we know that Google signed that email and if they don't lie about the timestamps, which I don't think Google does, we know those emails are real.\nWhat they mean is a different question, but we know they're real.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:01:36\n\nYes, and thanks to OpenTimestamps, we know that the emails were really sent.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:01:40\n\nActually, thanks to OpenTimestamps, we know less than that, but we can get into that.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:01:45\n\nOkay, let's get into OpenTimestamps then.\n\n## Open Timestamps\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:01:47\n\nSo OpenTimestamps, it's a project by Peter Todd, former Bitcoin Core contributor.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:01:52\n\nHe likes to call himself a former Bitcoin Core contributor.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:01:56\n\nYes, and applied cryptographer consultant.\nThat's what he calls himself.\nOkay.\nSo do you want to explain what it is?\nOpen timestamps?\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:02:05\n\nWell it's basically a way to prove that a given document exists, existed before a certain time.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:02:13\n\nYeah, before or at a certain time I guess.\nYeah, well if you\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:02:18\n\nadd one second then you can\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:02:19\n\nmake it before.\nSure, exactly.\nSure, fair enough.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:02:21\n\nBut the idea is you can, you know, you use the Bitcoin blockchain for this because Bitcoin blocks, we know when they were created, roughly, not to the second, but we know roughly when they were created.\nAnd so if the Bitcoin blockchain points to a document, and I say points to in quotes, that means that document must have existed before that part of the blockchain was created.\nAnd that's kind of what OpenTimestamp leverages.\nOf course, we don't actually put documents in the blockchain, that would be bad.\nWe put timestamps in the documents, in the blockchain.\nAnd these timestamps are a hash of the document, or they are a hash of multiple documents.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:02:59\n\nThere are actual documents in the blockchain, aren't there?\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:03:02\n\nThat's correct.\nSo that's the worst way you can do this.\nYou can put the actual document in the blockchain and then you can prove that that document existed, you know, very long ago and some people were doing that back in 2011.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:03:16\n\nYeah, for example, the Bitcoin white paper, I think, is in the blockchain, right?\nIt could be.\nI think so.\nBut anyway, so there's a better way of doing this.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:03:24\n\nYes, because a document can be hashed.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:03:28\n\nYes, so what's a hash?\nIs that too much for our audience?\nDo they already understand that you think?\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:03:36\n\nNo, it's good to remind people.\n\n## What Is a Hash\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:03:37\n\nOkay, let's get it.\nWhat is a hash?\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:03:39\n\nWe can teach them something.\nThe Dutch word for hash is verhospeling.\nNot that anyone would ever use that word.\nBut it is basically a mangled version of the document.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:03:48\n\nWhy did you mention that?\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:03:50\n\nBecause we want to educate our users.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:03:52\n\nWe want to teach them Dutch?\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:03:53\n\nYes.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:03:54\n\nFor the hospital.\nYou taught me something, I didn't know that.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:03:57\n\nWell, yeah, because nobody would use that.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:03:59\n\nRight.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:04:00\n\nSo the idea is that you take any given text and you mangle it in a way that you get just a number Or you know, it looks like a bunch of letters, but it's just a big number.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:04:11\n\nYeah.\nWell, it's a hexadecimal number, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:04:14\n\nWell a number is a number but you can write a number as a hexadecimal.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:04:17\n\nExactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:04:17\n\nSo the key there is that if you change one letter in the text, the hash changes.\nAnd so a good hash function is something that takes any text and produces a unique number and does not collide.\nSo you cannot come up with two different tags that produce the same number.\nRight.\nNow that's of course impossible to actually prove, but the wizards came up with, for example, SHA-256, and so far it seems to work.\nAnd the nice thing is the Bitcoin blockchain keeps producing blocks, and there's a pretty big incentive to find a duplicate.\nSo if there is a vulnerability in SHA256 where you could take, you could change the contents of a block and still have the same proof of work, That would be bad, but we'll find out soon enough.\n\n## Benefits of a Hash\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:05:03\n\nYeah, so I guess the benefits of a hash I would describe as you can, if you have a hash of a document and you have the document, then you can prove that the hash of the document is in fact the hash of the document, because every time you hash the document, the same hash comes out.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:05:19\n\nThat's right.\nAnd the\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:05:20\n\nother benefit is that a hash is very small compared to the document.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:05:24\n\nThat's also right.\nOr at\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:05:24\n\nleast it can be very small.\nSo you can have, I don't know, an entire book, and you produce a hash of it, then you just have one string of numbers.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:05:32\n\nExactly.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:05:33\n\nSo now you can prove that the book is the same thing as the hash.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:05:37\n\nYeah, and this can be useful for very practical stuff like if you have optical character recognition, so you're scanning a book and you want to make sure that the scan is correct, or maybe you have a checksum, which is also a hash.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:05:50\n\nRight.\nOkay.\nSo that's what a hash is.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:05:52\n\nYes.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:05:52\n\nDo we cover hashes?\nYeah.\nI think so.\n\n## Miracle Tree\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:05:55\n\nNow, something we discussed last week is a Merkle tree.\nHow about I explain the Merkle tree this time?\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:06:01\n\nSounds good.\nGo ahead.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:06:01\n\nAnd then people can tell us who did a better job.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:06:04\n\nAll\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:06:04\n\nright.\nOkay, so we're hashing documents.\nWe just explained how we're hashing documents.\nNow we have, let's say we have two documents.\nEach of them we turn into a hash.\nSo now we have two hashes.\nNow we take the two hashes and we combine these and turn them into a new hash.\nSo now we have one hash again.\nNow we have two more documents.\nWe hash these documents as well.\nWe have two hashes.\nThese two hashes we hash again.\nSo now in total we still have two hashes.\nWe hash these hashes together and now once again we have one hash.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:06:40\n\nOne hash that represents all these four documents.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:06:42\n\nYes, one hash that includes all four.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:06:44\n\nAnd This looks like a pyramid, but we call it a tree.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:06:49\n\nYes, it's a reverse tree.\nIt's a pyramid.\nYeah, you're right.\nThat's what a Merkle tree is.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:06:54\n\nSo why do we care about Merkle trees?\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:06:56\n\nThe nice thing about the Merkle tree is that if you have one of the documents that's included in the Merkle tree, you should be able to prove that it is in the Merkle tree to someone who only has the Merkle hash, which was the last hash we ended up with.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:07:14\n\nExactly.\nAnd they also don't need to know every document in the Merkle tree.\nSo you can reveal one document in the Merkle tree.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:07:21\n\nRight.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:07:22\n\nBy, you know, revealing the right hashes.\nBasically one at every level of the tree.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:07:26\n\nYes, which is called a Merkle root.\nOr Merkle proof.\nOh, sorry.\nMerkle proof.\nSo yeah, okay.\nOkay.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:07:33\n\nSo why do we care about this?\nInstead of putting the whole document inside the blockchain in the transaction, we can put a hash of a document in a transaction.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:07:42\n\nRight, which is much more compact, much smaller, and therefore requires less block space and less fees.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:07:47\n\nExactly.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:07:47\n\nSo that's better.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:07:48\n\nAnd there's a nice way to do that.\nThis is called OP return, which we discussed, I believe in a previous episode.\nIt basically tells the node, like everything after this, you can ignore.\nYou don't have to put this in your UTXO set, which we talked about last episode, takes up RAM.\nSo you write OP return in the destination of your payment, and then it's followed by the hash.\nAnd then some other software will have to interpret that.\nRight.\nBut it's still a bit inefficient, right?\nAnd that's why we're talking about this Merkle tree.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:08:14\n\nYeah, you don't want to have to create a transaction for each document you want to include in a blockchain because there's a better way and that's including the Merkle root.\nThat's right.\nI'm confused about terms can you\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:08:26\n\nhear?\nSo the Merkle root is the top of the tree yes or the top of the roots or the bottom of the upside down tree, depending on how you want to look at it.\nAnd the Merkle proof is a way to say that this given document actually is part of that tree without having to reveal the entire tree, but just bits of the tree.\nSo how do you use this in practice is the question because you might just have one document that you want to timestamp but you don't want to create a transaction for that, but what if people could come together and Yeah, basically have a whole bunch of documents maybe once a day or once an hour, timestamped.\nAnd that is where the calendar server comes out.\nSo this is a super centralized solution, but that doesn't really matter.\nAnd we'll explain why that doesn't matter.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:09:14\n\nIt's a server run by Peter Todd in this case, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:09:17\n\nIt could be, we don't know, but that's what he says.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:09:19\n\nI trust Peter, don't you?\nI trust Peter to run this server.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:09:24\n\nWe don't have to.\nThat's even better.\nYes.\nOkay, so what this calendar server does is basically everybody keeps sending documents to it or actually hashes of documents to it of course not the actual document that would be bad and the server basically waits one second and then tells you at the end of that second you know if you were the only hash or if there were other people who submitted something in that second, and it gives you a hash back.\nAnd you then need to call that server again a while later to say, hey, has this thing been included in the block yet?\nBecause every couple hours, it will take all these hashes and make a Merkle tree out of that and put that on the blockchain inside a transaction.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:10:05\n\nSo what the server is returning to you immediately is a hash of the document itself?\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:10:10\n\nI think the server immediately returns either a timestamp or maybe the hash of every other document it perceived.\nNo, probably, I guess a timestamp.\nI haven't looked at the implementation, but the idea is that it groups everybody into seconds, so you never have to wait for more than a second.\nAnd then at some point, multiple seconds worth of transactions, multiple seconds worth of documents are put into a single transaction, which is confirmed in a chain.\nAnd then the server will actually give you the whole chain of evidence you need to go from the document you submitted to that transaction and the block.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:10:45\n\nOkay, so that last part doesn't happen immediately.\nThat last part telling you where to find it in the tree, that only happens when it's included in a transaction.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:10:53\n\nWell, it has to, right?\nAnd included in a block, because you don't know what block it's going to be in when you make the transaction.\nBut you don't even know what the transaction is going to look like because there's more documents coming in.\nSo the hash keeps changing.\nThe hash that goes into the transaction keeps changing as new documents go to this calendar server.\nBut eventually, at some point, everything it's got so far goes into a transaction, it gets confirmed, and now it has that proof.\nSo this is where it can be, you know, where you temporarily have to trust it.\nBut you can see if it's not doing what it's supposed to do.\nIt could just decide to throw away your document and never include it.\nBut once it has done that, you don't need it anymore, because you get all the evidence yourself and you can keep it.\nAnd if they somehow censor you, then you just run your own server.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:11:42\n\nOkay, so if I understand correctly, Everyone's sending in documents they want to have hashed, or do they send in the hashes themselves?\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:11:49\n\nThey send in the hashes.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:11:50\n\nOkay, so everyone sends in hashes of documents they want to have timestamped.\nOnce a second, Peter Todd returns, or well, the calendar server, whoever operates it, returns either a hash of the document, if there was only one document that second.\nOr no, in that case, what do you get back because you're already sending in a hash?\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:12:11\n\nI guess it'll just give you the hash back.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:12:13\n\nOkay, so...\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:12:13\n\nI haven't read the exact code, but this is probably how it roughly works.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:12:17\n\nYeah, it's a bit of an implementation detail anyway.\nSo you send in the hash of the document you want to have timestamped.\nOnce a second, a hash is returned, which is either then I guess that hash, or if multiple people send in documents, or if there were multiple hashes of documents sent in in the same second, then a Merkle root is returned plus a Merkle path, which lets you find your hash in the tree.\nExactly.\nIt's like a miniature tree for once a second.\nEvery second, there's a miniature tree.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:12:51\n\nAnd this just prevents you from flooding the server with millions of hashes and it having to hold on to that for years.\nNow, whatever you throw at it in one second, it can forget after one second.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:13:02\n\nRight.\nNow, all of these miniature trees, to call them that, these are all sort of accumulated and turned into a new Merkle tree.\nAnd the Merkle root of that tree is once a while included in a Bitcoin transaction.\nAt that point, all of the documents are basically time-stamped in the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:13:22\n\nYes, but you still don't have the proof.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:13:24\n\nYes, and that proof is also sent to you by the server.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:13:27\n\nNo, no, no.\nThe server, you know, it's not, don't call us, we call you.\nIt's the opposite.\nYou have to call the server.\nSo you basically, every now and then, I think there's a way that you can just wait for it if you have a patient computer, but you can also pull it later and say, hey, do you have the full proof of me now?\nAnd at that point, it will give you everything you need.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:13:47\n\nRight, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:13:48\n\nSo which to go back is basically you started your document that you gave the hash.\nAnd then the whatever hashes of all the documents in that one second, and then whatever transaction it comes in, and then where that is in the block.\nRight.\nThat's pretty much the proof.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:14:06\n\nAll right, so now we've included a document or the hash of a document in the Bitcoin blockchain through this miracle trick.\nNow we want to prove to someone later on, it's a year later, we want to prove to someone that a year ago we included this hash into the Bitcoin blockchain.\nHow do we do that?\nHow do we prove it?\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:14:24\n\nRight.\nSo first you give that person the actual document, and then you give them this OTS file, which contains the proof.\nBasically all these these Merkle proofs that we stored before.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:14:36\n\nRight and then what does that person do with that?\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:14:39\n\nThey run a command called OTS verify which basically checks the proof so it checks whether all the hashes are what they say they should be.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:14:46\n\nAnd then\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:14:47\n\nit checks against your own node whether the transaction is included in the blockchain.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:14:52\n\nSo that requires them to have the OpenTimestamp software, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:14:56\n\nThat's right.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:14:56\n\nAnd the OpenTimestamp software uses the Bitcoin blockchain that you have on your node to check if it's really in there.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:15:02\n\nExactly.\nAnd so it does not need any of these calendar services.\nSo these are just necessary to store proof, but they can disappear off the face of the earth as long as you keep the file with the proof.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:15:12\n\nRight.\nSo now in recent weeks we discussed all sorts of pruning tricks, these kinds of things.\nWhat if you're running a pruned node?\nCan you still check the blockchain somehow?\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:15:22\n\nYes, because the nice thing is that you can prove that a transaction exists in a block without keeping the whole block.\nYou can just basically provide a Merkle proof that the transaction actually occurs in the block.\nRight.\nAnd therefore the only thing you need is the block header.\nAnd yeah, you still have that.\nIf you prune everything, you don't prune the headers.\nNice.\nSo you have a nice chain of evidence.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:15:43\n\nOkay, so let's get to the reason why we're discussing all of this, Jors.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:15:46\n\nExactly.\nSo basically there was an email, let's say Alice was asking Bob for coffee.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:15:53\n\nYou don't want to trigger anyone so we're just gonna use Alice and Bob.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:15:57\n\nAlso don't know the name of the sender.\nLet's say Alice was asking Bob for a coffee back in 2015.\nAnd an email circulates on the internet.\nBut you do see an email, so you might rightfully ask, okay, maybe this email is completely fake.\nRight?\nBut the nice thing is that...\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:16:12\n\nYou can never trust Alice and Bob not to lie about coffee.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:16:16\n\nWell, or you're not even trusting Alice or Bob because this email just comes out of nowhere.\nIt wasn't given to you by Alice or by Bob.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:16:23\n\nYeah, I'm just saying I don't trust Alice and Bob's words for whether or not they had coffee together.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:16:29\n\nThat's true.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:16:30\n\nI want cryptographic proof about them drinking coffee or not, Sjoerd.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:16:33\n\nWell, it doesn't prove whether they actually drank coffee, right?\nIt just proves that Alice asked Bob for coffee.\nI'll settle for that.\n\n## Spam and Fishing\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:16:40\n\nOkay, so the nice thing is we have this problem called spam and phishing, you know, basically fake emails pretending to be somebody else.\nAnd the way that is partially solved is that mail servers can sign emails for you.\nSo you don't have to use PGP yourself, although of course you should, but the mail server will say, okay, this email goes to this person and here's the signature, basically testifying to that.\nAnd Gmail does that standard.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:17:07\n\nRight.\nSo they have a special key to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:17:10\n\nYeah, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:17:11\n\nSo it's basically in that case, Google saying, yep, this is the real email.\nThis was the real sender.\nThis was the real recipient.\nIt was really Alice and Bob.\nAnd yes, they were really discussing getting a cup of coffee together.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:17:24\n\nExactly and that of course might be enough but you know because it depends on how much you trust Google of course.\nGoogle signs a couple of fields, which is the sender, the recipient, the time, and the contents of the message, so you know that.\nBut, you know, we're Bitcoiners, so we want to have more.\nAnd so the thing is that there is actually another email out there which we can talk about which is Greg Maxwell sending Peter Todd a message randomly about some Bitcoin thing and it happens that Peter Todd timestamped that message back in 2016 and that message is using the Google's key.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:18:04\n\nThe same key.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:18:06\n\nSo now we have proof that not only did Google sign this thing, they used a key that already existed back in those days.\nBecause we know that key existed.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:18:16\n\nRight, because it was timestamped on the Bitcoin blockchain exactly back in those days.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:18:20\n\nYeah, now that doesn't really you know matter that this key existed because we already know Google signed it.\nIf you assume Google lied about the timestamps that'd be weird.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:18:31\n\nStill nice.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:18:31\n\nYes, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:18:33\n\nThat's a bit of a downer to end the podcast on.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:18:35\n\nOh, we're not ending\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:18:36\n\nthe podcast.\nLet's give some better examples than why open timestamps is great.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:18:40\n\nYeah, well, so the caveat is always people get really excited about timestamps and They are quite useful, but they are not magic bullets.\nAnd there's a lot of things they can't do.\nSo, you know, don't assign magic to them.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:18:53\n\nOkay.\nThere's a couple\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:18:54\n\nof things you cannot prove.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:18:55\n\nSo there wasn't enough of a downer.\nNow you're going to list more things you cannot do with timestamps?\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:18:59\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:19:00\n\nOkay, let's have it.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:19:01\n\nThe things you cannot prove, you cannot prove, and sorry for all the double negatives, but you cannot prove that a document does not exist.\nAnd what this means is, you can say, hey, I said X back in 2015.\nThat's what you can prove that.\nBut you cannot prove that you didn't say X in 2015.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:19:19\n\nYou cannot say that you didn't say X in 2015.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:19:23\n\nRight, if I say I never said blah in 2015, there's no way for me to prove that.\nUnless I have like 24-hour footage.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:19:32\n\nRight, of yourself.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:19:34\n\nYeah, for the whole year.\nSure.\nBut other than that you can't.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:19:37\n\nOkay.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:19:38\n\nThe other thing you can do\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:19:39\n\nis but someone else might be able to For example with this email example,\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:19:44\n\nwell, they can if you did say but not what I didn't say So the other thing you can can't say is that there's only one thing that I said.\nSo I might have said in 2015, Bitcoin is gonna go to 100, and then I would say Bitcoin is gonna go to 1,000, and I would say Bitcoin is gonna go to 10,000, and then, you know, today I released the proof that I set the right price but you have no idea how many other prices I time stamped.\nRight.\nSo that's important to keep in mind when people use time stamps in Magic Tricks.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:20:14\n\nYou might have just time stamped every single possible price for 2020 and then come out as a visionary in 2020 because you're only revealing the one you got right.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:20:25\n\nExactly.\nI also can't prove that something is older than the timestamp.\nBasically if I timestamp something now then you have no way, I have no way of proving that maybe it was ten years ago.\nYeah.\nRight?\nSo, if you have some sort of magical anti-aging medicine, you can say, oh, look at how I looked in 2016, but actually that was me in 1981 or something.\nSure.\nSome more disappointments?\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:20:51\n\nYeah I want another one.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:20:53\n\nIf you lose the proof or if you lose the original document well then you're screwed right because if you have the hash you cannot reconstruct the document.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:21:02\n\nRight.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:21:02\n\nAnd if you just have the hash, I don't think you can still figure out how to connect that to the thing in the blockchain.\nYou need all these intermediate steps of the tree.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:21:11\n\nYeah, you need the document in order to prove that the hash matches the document by just hashing the document again.\nPlus you need all sorts of extra info to find it in the blockchain.\nSure, yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:21:22\n\nYeah, that's what you downloaded and hopefully saved in a file.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:21:24\n\nYeah, okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:21:25\n\nAnd the last thing, that's kind of a bummer, you can't really prove that a website is real in general.\nIt's very difficult.\nSo if, let's say there's a tweet, and the tweet has a URL, and if I give that to you, you have no way of...\nI cannot prove to you that that URL really contains that tweet.\nI mean, you can go to it yourself, but that's the only way you can find out.\nAnd so that's a problem if 10 years from now I want to prove that a certain tweet was real.\nIf it's still there, then I can prove that it existed.\nSo I can make a timestamp of the, basically the website\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:22:02\n\nas\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:22:03\n\nthe document looks, and then, you know, today you look at it again and you can see well I'm seeing the same text.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:22:09\n\nSo how would you fake that a website existed then?\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:22:13\n\nI can just edit some HTML and make a different tweet.\nI can make a website that shows a tweet\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:22:20\n\nbut the\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:22:20\n\ntweet could be complete nonsense and so I have no way to prove that but if the tweet didn't change then I can prove it\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:22:26\n\nright\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:22:27\n\nand but the problem is of course you can delete tweets So that's why you have things like the web archive.\nSo you can make a timestamp of a tweet on the web archive.\nAnd if the web archive is still out there when you check the evidence, then you can prove that the tweet existed.\nBut if the tweeter deletes that tweet and gets rid of the web archive, then you're screwed.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:22:49\n\nYeah, couldn't you make a backup of the web archive yourself?\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:22:51\n\nBut then how do you prove that that's the real web archive?\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:22:54\n\nI don't know.\nIf you timestamp the web archive and keep a backup of the web archive, then...\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:23:00\n\nWell, it depends on when you made it.\nSo then the question is, when you made that backup, did you have reason, did you already know what things you needed to fake?\nOr was it impossible for you to know what things you needed to fake?\nSo there's still, you know, things you can do if you carefully think about what you have and what you don't have.\nBut it's not magic.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:23:19\n\nIt's not magic.\nSo what is great about it?\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:23:22\n\nWell, that's why we have a list of called cool things.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:23:25\n\nNice.\n\n## Timestamp Git Commits\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:23:26\n\nSo one of the cool things you can do is you can timestamp git commits and Bitcoin Core is doing that.\nWhich is nice.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:23:34\n\nSo every time there's a new commit to the Bitcoin Core source code, that is timestamps.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:23:40\n\nExactly.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:23:41\n\nRight.\nInteresting.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:23:41\n\nAnd we know that all these commits that go into Bitcoin Core are signed by the maintainers too.\nSo there's two things.\nWe now, we have these timestamps and assuming somebody stores the evidence, multiple people store that evidence and the signatures are real.\nYou can go back in time, look at these timestamps and see that the history is indeed what GitHub says it is.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:24:05\n\nRight.\nYou can trace the entire history, or at least up to a point, of what the Bitcoin Core source code looked like.\nNow, if somehow there would be another version of history timestamped in there, then it's either not signed by the maintainers, so it's obvious that's the fake one, or I guess in a worst case scenario, if it is signed by the maintainers,\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:24:29\n\nthen we know that That particular maintainer has been signing two versions of history.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:24:33\n\nSo we know there's a problem at least.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:24:35\n\nYeah, you might still not know which is the real one, but you know there's a very serious problem.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:24:39\n\nYeah, interesting.\nOkay, more cool stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:24:42\n\nAnother cool thing is actually the opposite.\nThe Genesis block timestamps the times.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:24:48\n\nYeah, the newspaper, sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:24:49\n\nBut actually it's, you know, in practice more like the other way around, right?\nThe fact that the times occurs in the Bitcoin blockchain, that times article from January 3rd, 2009, The fact that that occurs in the blockchain means that the blockchain must be more recent than that.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:25:06\n\nYes, well the Genesis block at least, yes.\nWell, so I guess the whole blockchain, sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:25:10\n\nYes, because everything else came after.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:25:12\n\nYes.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:25:13\n\nSo that's a nice example of how timestamps in the real world, you know, can prove what's going on in Bitcoin.\nSo I guess you can use some of that magic to triangulate stuff if people put newspaper articles in the blockchain, then you have some extra assurance that this thing is really not older than you think it is.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:25:30\n\nOkay, more cool stuff.\n\n## Limit the Scope of Fraud\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:25:31\n\nWell, the last thing is, I guess, more of a general claim is that you can limit the scope of fraud I believe that's how Peter thought phrased it so you cannot necessarily prevent all forms of fraud as we discussed it could be really funky things going on but there's a limit there's a more limited things you can do because these timestamps exist.\nYou have to be more careful.\nYou cannot, for example, say, hey, this Google key was recently created by a Russian hacker.\nNo, we know it was out there in 2016.\nSo there's certain things you can no longer claim based on these timestamps.\nAnd as we described with the example of the hypothetical evil Bitcoin Core maintainer that changes history, you can then prove that there are two versions of history, and that is something they would have to think\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:26:16\n\nabout.\nYeah, so what I really like about this idea, so for I think timestamps and these kinds of timestamps and open timestamps, it is, I think, the most interesting and the most important non-monetary use of Bitcoin.\nI think it's a big deal being able to timestamp documents in such a very viable way.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:26:37\n\nOkay yeah it's definitely very cool and very useful.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:26:40\n\nYou know I've studied history and it's a huge part of a historian's job to find out if documents, if evidence is really as old as it's supposed to be.\nA nice example is, I'm sure you've seen these photos of Joseph Stalin, where people are just photoshopped out before Photoshop was a thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:26:59\n\nYeah, exactly.\nNowadays, everybody does that.\nBut Yeah,\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:27:02\n\nback in those days, that was a bit more original.\nBut these are the kinds of things, like you can imagine how these kinds of trickeries could be prevented with something like Open Timestamps somehow, or at least be made more obvious, or it could be a very useful tool for historians, I think.\nThe other cool thing, Shorz, I'm going to tell you one more cool thing before we end this podcast.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:27:24\n\nAll right, tell\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:27:24\n\nme.\nI think one of the nice things about Open Timestamps is that it actually resembles the idea that is mentioned in the white paper in the Bitcoin white paper the Scott Stornetta and Stuart Haber if I'm recalling these names correctly they had their own idea for timestamping back in the I think it was either the late 80s or the early 90s.\nAnd back then, Stornetta's idea, his concern was that, as long as we have paper documents, then forging paper documents, is at least kind of difficult.\nIt's at least sort of like it leaves traces or you can sort of tell that something has been doctored with or messed with, or it's at least sort of possible while if we're moving.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:28:11\n\nAnd you know how old paper is.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:28:13\n\nYeah, you can even tell how old paper is in many cases, or at least roughly.\nAnd if we're moving to a digital world, that kind of stuff becomes completely impossible and every document can be altered in ways that are just unseeable.\nSo He wanted to solve that problem and he and Heber, they tried to solve this problem.\nThey couldn't figure out how to solve this problem because every solution they come up with relied on some kind of third party to vouch that a document existed at a certain point in time.\nAnd maybe that third party would be checked by another, by fourth party, but there was always some trust involved, and that's what I want to get rid of.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:28:59\n\nRight, and That sounds pretty problematic in the Stalin example you just mentioned.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:29:03\n\nExactly, yes.\nSo, ultimately, they thought they were not going to be able to solve this problem, and then they wanted to at least prove that this was an unsolvable problem.\nBut then while trying to prove that it was unsolvable, they came to the realization that, wait a minute, this is actually solvable if everyone in the world is party of the timestamping process.\nSo everyone in the world submits their hashes and everyone in this world receives the combined hashes in return.\nThat way, if you want to forge history, you would have to corrupt everyone or it would be obvious to everyone, like No one's going to go along with that.\nThat was their solution, and this solution, I think, evolved.\nUltimately, they came up with this idea of including the Merkle route into newspapers.\nThen there was a Merkle route in the New York Times of May 22nd, 1996.\nSo you knew that documents existed back then.\nYep.\nAnd ultimately, their ideas were inspiration for Satoshi Nakamoto.\nIt was included in the Bitcoin white paper.\nAnd that's interesting because now peter toss came up with a solution to actually implement a very similar solution into bitcoin so we've sort of gone full circle\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:30:26\n\nyeah it's great because everybody wants the bitcoin blockchain it's very redundant\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:30:32\n\nwhat\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:30:32\n\nit's very redundant basically Everybody has a copy of the Bitcoin blockchain.\nSo just like that newspaper.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:30:38\n\nRight, pretty much.\nOkay.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:30:41\n\nAnd they have a financial incentive to have this copy.\nIt's one thing to say everybody in the world must participate and have this hash, it's in order to say, well, if you want to use money you need to keep track of a hash and by the way it also fixes this timestamping problem.\nRight.\nOkay, I think, I guess that's all we've got.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:30:57\n\nI think so too, Sjoerd.\n\nSpeaker 1: 00:30:58\n\nSo thank you for listening to the Venn Weirdum, Sjoerd Nadeau.\n\nSpeaker 0: 00:31:01\n\nThere you go.\nThe Van Weerdam Shorsnado.\nThere you go.\n\n",

    "summary": "In a recent episode of the podcast Shortsnado, Sjors Provoost and Aaron van Wirdum engaged in a comprehensive discussion about the utility and implications of open timestamps, particularly in the realm of digital document verification. Their conversation began with an examination of the Hunter Biden email controversy, where digital timestamping played a pivotal role in authenticating the timing and authenticity of the emails through signatures verified by Google. This instance served as a practical demonstration of how digital technologies, specifically those based on blockchain, are revolutionizing the way we ascertain the integrity of digital documents.\n\nThe duo then shifted their focus to OpenTimestamps, a project pioneered by Peter Todd, which utilizes the immutable nature of the Bitcoin blockchain to irrefutably establish the existence of documents at or before a certain point in time. By embedding a document's hash into the blockchain, any alteration to the original document would result in a discernible change in the hash, effectively guaranteeing the document's integrity from that moment backward. The efficiency of this system, compared to earlier methods which involved inserting entire documents into the blockchain, was highlighted as a significant advancement in digital verification technologies.\n\nFurther elaboration was provided on the concept of Merkle trees, which allow for the secure and efficient verification of content within large datasets. By arranging document hashes in a tree-like structure, it becomes possible to verify the inclusion of a specific document without the need to disclose the entire dataset, thus enhancing privacy and reducing the blockchain space required for such operations.\n\nThe podcast also introduced the notion of a calendar server, a centralized entity designed to aggregate document hashes for subsequent timestamping on the blockchain. Despite its central nature, the hosts reassured listeners of the system's reliability, emphasizing that the server's functionality allows for immediate feedback on hash submissions and eventual confirmation of these hashes in a blockchain transaction, thereby providing a robust chain of evidence for document authenticity.\n\nDelving into the technicalities, Provoost and van Wirdum explained the process of submitting hashes for timestamping and the creation of miniature Merkle trees for grouped submissions, a method that ensures scalability and reduces server load. They detailed how an OTS file containing Merkle proofs can be used to verify the timestamping of a document on the blockchain, even years after its inclusion, highlighting the enduring nature of blockchain-based timestamping solutions.\n\nTowards the end of their conversation, the speakers explored broader applications of blockchain technology in verifying digital communications, such as emails, and discussed the potential of this technology to mitigate issues related to spam and phishing by authenticating emails at the server level. This discussion illustrated the expansive potential of blockchain technology in enhancing digital security and trust, underscoring the need for accessible cryptographic tools in everyday communications.\n\nIn conclusion, the dialogue between Sjors Provoost and Aaron van Wirdum provided insightful perspectives on the capabilities and limitations of digital timestamping within the Bitcoin ecosystem and beyond. While acknowledging the challenges in achieving absolute digital trust and verification, they also celebrated the practical applications of timestamping, such as in the Bitcoin Core source code and historical research, showcasing the profound implications of Bitcoin's timestamping capability for establishing document authenticity and integrity in our increasingly digital world."
