    <summary>On January 27, 2013, Pieter Todd discussed the uptime information available in seed.txt. Seed.txt is a dump file produced by bitcoin-seeder and contains information about all non-banned IPs that have ever successfully connected. According to Todd, the connectability percentage is a decaying average with a time constant of up to a month. Additionally, Todd mentioned having a script ready to combine one or more seeds.txt's data into a pnSeed[] array C source code and planned to add it to the repository.</summary>
