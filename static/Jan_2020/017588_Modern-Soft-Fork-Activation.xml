    <summary>The discussion revolves around the proposal of using BIP 9 process as a compelling activation path and for providing observation and discussion time for any objections before a BIP 8/flag day activation. The concern raised is whether there is enough time for observation and discussion with the proposed timeline. The example of the BIP 68/112/113 bundle is given to support this concern. One suggestion to improve this is to have the first point release that includes the soft-fork activation parameters not update getblocktemplate to signal the version bit by default, but only do that in a second point release later. Additionally, it is mentioned that version bits are set via mining software rather than the node software that constructs blocks, which means there is no strong link between signaling and having actually updated software to enforce new rules. It is suggested that moving signaling into the coinbase or similar could make that link tighter.</summary>
