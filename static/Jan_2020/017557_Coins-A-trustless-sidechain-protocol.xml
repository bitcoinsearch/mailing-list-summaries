    <summary>The author Robin has been working on a sidechain protocol that eliminates the need for a trusted third party. The whitepaper for this Bitcoin extension called Coins can be found at http://coins.github.io/coins.pdf. The proposed solution uses a bitcoin-backed proof-of-stake to solve the double-spending problem. Validators vote on sidechain blocks using one-time signatures, which guarantees that they lose their stake for publishing conflicting histories. Any user can become a validator by locking bitcoins. Checkpoints can be further secured with a bitcoin-backed proof-of-burn. Assuming a rational majority of validators, the sidechain provides safety and liveness. The protocol is a generic consensus mechanism that allows for arbitrary sidechain assets and can scale horizontally by spawning multiple, independent instances. Further research on scalability and usability can be found on Github at https://github.com/coins/coins.github.io. Feedback is appreciated.</summary>
