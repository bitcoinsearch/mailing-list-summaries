    <summary>In this context, Slush is asking for references regarding a possible solution to a problem that may eliminate the need for a hard fork. The problem is related to signing transactions with limited memory capabilities which require all previous transactions to be streamed into the device for each signed input. This means there would be 200^2 transaction verifications for 200 inputs to sign, making it slow but not limiting the device for any particular size of signed transaction. However, the writer is not sure where the ^2 is coming from, and suggests a solution that involves streaming in the input txid:vouts which are spent, followed by streaming the actual inputs that are hashed and value extracted, building a table of txid:vout-&gt;value, and then the actual transaction to be signed. This should have O(inputs) hashing and communications overhead.</summary>
