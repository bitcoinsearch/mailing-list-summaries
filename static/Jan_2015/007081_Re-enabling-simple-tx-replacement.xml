    <summary>In an email exchange on January 4th, 2015, Gregory Maxwell requested the raw transaction from a website but was unable to obtain it as the site only provided cooked JSON output that did not include the sequence number. However, he later determined that the behavior on the testnet was dysfunctional because the non-mempooling is enforced by IsStandardTx, which is bypassed in testnet. He suggested enforcing this elsewhere but clarified that this issue does not exist on the real network.</summary>
