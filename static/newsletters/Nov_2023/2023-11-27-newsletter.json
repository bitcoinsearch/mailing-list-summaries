    "summary_of_threads_started_this_week": "The SeedHammer team is advancing a novel descriptor format for metal engraved backups, aligning with BIPs 380-386 and BIP 389, and considering PSBT over CBOR for binary encoding to integrate wallet-policies, Miniscript, and additional metadata. They are weighing the addition of a unique header versus expanding the PSBT structure and are seeking community feedback through [proposal], [implementation], and [playground] before formalizing their approach.\n\nNiftynei has announced enhancements to the Liquidity Ads specification in core-lightning v0.10.1, including a shift from CheckSequenceVerify to CheckLockTimeVerify for fund locking, and the introduction of variable lease terms and \"lease locked\" transactions by @morehouse. Adjustments to channel fee caps and the proposed fraud proof mechanism are also under discussion, with base milli-satoshi cap revisions suggested by @t-bast. These revisions, influenced by community feedback and collaborative efforts, aim to bolster the system's robustness and are documented in the accessible draft and commits.",
