    <summary>In a discussion about double-spend fighting options, Andrew Schaaf suggested that mining pools could offer a real-time feed of accepted transactions. He planned to create a minimal bitcoind patch that writes raw accepted transactions and blocks to stdout with a prefix and a minimal NodeJS app that invokes bitcoind as a subprocess, parses the transactions and blocks, and offers a real-time feed. However, Matt pointed out that mining pools already provide an IP address for their node or a proxy node on top of theirs for security purposes.</summary>
