    <summary>The context discusses a scenario where two scammers attempt to buy two Ferraris using only one set of Bitcoins, by spending the same coins at exactly the same moment. The current solution is for vendors to wait for six confirmations before releasing goods, which is a long time. The proposal suggests that when a node drops a transaction due to double spend, it should be broadcast with a new "inv" type called "MSG_DOUBLESPEND," allowing vendors and miners to operate whatever policy they want, such as waiting for more confirmations or calling the police. This proposal would not make it possible to DOS a transaction because it can only be done by someone with the appropriate private keys. In the future, Bitcoin payment processors could handle double-spend checks and provide quicker confirmations and insurance against unconfirmed transactions being invalidated.</summary>
