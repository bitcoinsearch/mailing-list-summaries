    <summary>In an email conversation dated August 18, 2011, Bitcoin developer theymos proposed a solution to address the issue of double-spending attacks. The proposal entailed nodes that receive new transactions through blocks to relay them as if they had received them normally. However, this approach was deemed to be not very helpful since attackers could still release conflicting transactions at the same time to different nodes or inject them into multiple places in the network simultaneously.</summary>
