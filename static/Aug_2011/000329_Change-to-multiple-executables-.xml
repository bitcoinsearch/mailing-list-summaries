    <summary>In an email thread from 2011, John Smith proposed to split the current mainline client into three separate executables: bitcoind (bitcoin daemon), bitcoin(-qt) (bitcoin GUI executable), and bitcoincl (bitcoin RPC command line). The proposal was made because having everything in one executable can be confusing for users. By default, all three would be built, but in non-GUI mode, only bitcoind and bitcoincl would be built. The advantages of this proposal included making it clearer for the user, simplifying the main functions, not wasting memory by linking UI libs when running a background process, and preventing accidentally launching the daemon/UI locally if you just want to send a command and forget to give an argument. However, not everyone agreed with the proposal, and some thought that splitting into more executables would complicate things unnecessarily. Despite this, there was agreement on the need to split the source into separate library-like components.</summary>
