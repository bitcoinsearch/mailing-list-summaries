    <summary>In a discussion thread from 2011, Gregory Maxwell and Mike Hearn discuss the issue of a starved p2p network for connectable slots. Hearn suggests increasing anti-DoS limits in version 0.4, but Maxwell points out that this was already addressed in version .24 to prevent memory issues on lower memory systems such as VMs. Maxwell also notes that there should be enough connection slots available, so they need to investigate why it isn't working properly.</summary>
