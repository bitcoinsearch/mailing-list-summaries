    <summary>In a discussion on detecting double spends issue in Bitcoin transactions, Mike Hearn referred to Satoshi's opinion that a well-connected node can easily monitor miners/network for double-spends and alert whoever may need to know that the transaction should not be accepted. He also believed that adding more stuff to the network protocol is not required and payment processors can handle such things. Stefan Thomas suggested another pragmatic way to detect double spends: by connecting to lots of clients and verifying if they all send the same transaction, making double spend unlikely. If some don't send the transaction or send a conflicting one, then a double spend is in progress. Both methods were supported by members in the discussion and it was noted that not everyone needs to care about transaction confirmation time, especially storefronts dealing in digital goods and physical purchases.</summary>
