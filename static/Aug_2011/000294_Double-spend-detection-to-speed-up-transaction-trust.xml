    <summary>In an email exchange dated August 4th, 2011 between Andy Parkins and Matt Corallo, the latter questions the benefits of adding a message to address double-spending attempts in Bitcoin transactions. He argues that it would result in more network traffic, which is not desirable, and adds another message people have to know about. However, Parkins claims that the impact on network traffic would be greater than what Corallo suggests, especially considering that double-spends can be generated on demand, leading to unbounded flooding. The normal anti-DDOS logic would not work because there can be no additional proof-of-workish costs for the double spend. To solve this issue, they propose propagating conflicts on each of the conflicted inputs. Conflicting inputs could be flagged as suspect temporarily, making them unavailable for other transactions. This feature might be useful, but the software already waits for a fair number of confirms before considering something confirmed, so it may not be necessary. A sybil attack could also filter messages, diminishing their usefulness in identifying double-spends.</summary>
