    <summary>In an email exchange from August 3, 2011, Mike Hearn expressed concern over the scarcity of connectable slots in the p2p network. He suggested increasing anti-DoS limits in version 0.4 to address the issue. However, one cannot simply increase the number of available connection slots without risking memory issues for lower memory systems such as virtual machines. The current allotment of 125 connection slots should be sufficient, prompting the need to investigate why it is not meeting the demands of the network.</summary>
