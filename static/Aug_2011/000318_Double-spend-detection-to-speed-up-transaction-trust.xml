    <summary>In an email conversation between Andy Parkins and Mike Hearn, they discussed the relevance of "number of connections" as a metric. They agreed that too many connections would fill everyone's connection slots and prevent anyone from making connections, while too few connections would result in isolated islands causing serious problems. The question then becomes how many connections are needed to be considered secure. They also noted that if a user is not relaying, each connection takes up almost no bandwidth. The email contained a digital signature attachment.</summary>
