    <summary>Dan Kaminsky discussed some potential security vulnerabilities in Bitcoin at the Black Hat 2011 conference. While details were scarce, it was mentioned that Kaminsky had created a tool called "blitcoin" which could potentially reveal both sides of a Bitcoin transaction. Some speculate that the tool attempts to map out a person's network connections based on inputs and outputs. Despite claims that Bitcoin is not anonymous, some individuals still refuse to believe this fact. There is currently little additional information available about Kaminsky's tool or the potential vulnerabilities he identified.</summary>
