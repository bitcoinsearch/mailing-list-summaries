    <summary>In an email thread from 2011, Gregory Maxwell expressed concern that those who "connect to everyone" in the .ru/.ua nodes are causing harm. He noted that some of these nodes aggressively connect to him and have never passed a transaction in all his available logs. In response, another individual suggested going through their logs to see how many connections are clearly bad and dropping them over time as they are not functioning nodes. The thread also includes a non-text attachment of a digitally signed message part.</summary>
