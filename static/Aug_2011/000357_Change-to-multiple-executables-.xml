    <summary>The email exchange between John Smith and Pieter, dated August 11, 2011, was about a proposal to remove the RPC client from the gui/daemon executable. At first, Pieter expressed mild opposition to this proposal, but upon clarification, he agreed to it. He also suggested that discussions on ideas should be more open, stating that people tend to misconstrue negative remarks as a "shot down" and stop pursuing them. Pieter then proposed the need for a development branch, which should be separate from the main tree, to allow for internal changes that may not be suitable for the conservative approach used in the main tree. On the issue of backward incompatible changes to the protocol, Pieter acknowledged the deficiencies in the current system but did not think it was worth the hassle to make changes at that time. However, he was in favor of creating a wiki page to list these issues, along with their pros and cons, for future reference when an incompatible change is necessary.</summary>
